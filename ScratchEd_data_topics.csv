Here is mine from Expo School in St. Paul, MN: http://scratch.mit.edu/galleries/view/29."298	"Building Learning Communities | July 27, 2009"	7/11/09 12:20	"We're happy to be hosting two pre-conference workshops for this year's November Learning conference. From 8:30 to 12:30, there's an introductory Scratch workshop and, from 1:30 to 5:30, there's a workshop about ScratchEd. If you've registered to attend either of these workshops, we'd love to hear from you! What prompted you to participate? What do you hope to get out of the experience?"300	Resources Rating System	7/11/09 16:52	"I received a suggestion for adding ratings to the resources. Currently, it's possible to ""feature"" resources (and then look at the collection of featured resources). People can also bookmark/favorite resources they like (and then sort the resources that way). What sort of ratings system do you think would be useful and why?"314	"Screencasts, publish on YouTube?"	7/13/09 13:07	"Hi all. It’s great to see this Web site. I am considering using YouTube to host a series of Scratch tutorial screencasts (created from ScreenFlow on a Mac). I have one video there now which gives a quick overview of my teaching with Scratch, Alice, Python and Pygame. How do you publish your tutorial videos? Care to share any details such as software, screen resolution, video codecs used, etc.? I find so far that the quality on YouTube (even at “HD”) is not as good as the QuickTime mov file I produce from ScreenFlow, but I can read the Scratch blocks pretty well. Dave Briccetti Lafayette, California"315	Nice discussions software	7/13/09 13:08	"I saved something in the wrong category, and found I could edit it and move it. Nice."317	Scratch at Silicon Valley Code Camp	7/13/09 14:14	"I’m giving two talks about Scratch (and Alice and some graphics software) at Silicon Valley Code Camp in the beginning of October. This is a free conference. I could use some volunteers to walk around and help students with Scratch. I usually use my older students for this, but perhaps there are some adult educators in the area who are skilled with Scratch."318	How do you introduce Scratch to beginners?	7/13/09 21:19	"Do you have any favorite activities or approaches to introduce Scratch to beginners? At the moment, I really like something from this set: 8 blocks: Create any project given a particular set of eight Scratch blocks. Monkey business: (with very little introduction to the Scratch user interface, just showing how to snap blocks together) Create a project where something surprising happens to a monkey. Interactive me: (with a walkthrough of how to create an interactive sprite) Create an interactive project that helps others learn about you and the people, issues, and things you care about. What do you do?"319	Scratch 1.4 Available	7/13/09 21:24	"In case you haven't yet heard, the latest version of Scratch is now available for download! New features include: keyboard input with the ask block webcam integration string manipulators LEGO WeDo support support for smaller screens (like on netbooks) Have you tried it already?"338	What is computational thinking?	7/16/09 10:19	"In his talk this morning at the Creative Computing workshop, Mitch asked: ""What does computational thinking mean to you?"" What do you think?"344	Art and Technology	7/16/09 13:31	In connection with afternoon's session of the Creative Computing workshop.... * How does technology inspire you to think about art in new ways? * How does art inspire you to think about technology in new ways?348	How do you explain parallelism and events?	7/17/09 8:58	We're exploring a variety of computational concepts at the Creative Computing workshop. Today we've been exploring the ideas of parallelism and events. How would you explain these two concepts?349	What is a story?	7/17/09 9:02	"In today's Creative Computing workshop, we've been creating stories with Scratch. What was your experience of creating stories with Scratch? How does Scratch expand (or limit) what it means to tell a story?"350	Before the end of Creative Computing	7/17/09 14:18	"In preparation for our final day of Creative Computing tomorrow, it would be great to know what you hope to ask/get/know/share before our time together is over. Let's start a list..."355	"Games, games, games"	7/18/09 10:04	"We've been looking at games this morning at the Creative Computing workshop. What games do you play? What did you think of the games we've been seeing and creating today? Where do games fit into school? Vicki posted about a game she works with:  "" If you haven't used Medmyst from Rice Univ. - you might want to check it out. It is all about Infectious Disease and I think they have done a wonder job! The URL is http://medmyst.rice.edu/ """358	Page names in Scratch Ed	7/19/09 17:34	"I just noticed something when trying to direct someone to a specific page at Scratch ed, in the regular Scratch forums.  The pages all have the same URL?  Being able to give a particular resource's address is handy, or is there another way to link to a specific section of this site?"388	Suggestion: Run Scratch Projects in Web Page	7/24/09 8:58	"It's great that you can attach Scratch projects to resources and stories and download them. It would also be nice to be able to run them directly in the browser. Maybe each project thumbnail could have under it a ""play"" and ""download"" button or something?"401	math & physics resources	7/26/09 14:29	"hello, i am diving into scratch and i hope to be ready before september begins, in order to start 1 or 2 courses for kids in my school; now, my question: i already know scratch is totally helpful in math and physics teaching but i'd like to know if there is any book or web resource where projects regarding these curricula are grouped by age or grades of kids or, better, math (or physics) topics, e.g.: - algebra projects - geometry projects - calculus projects etc. more exactely, i mean that you may find hundreds of projects tagged math or physics in the scratch site but they span a very different level of complexity and so i have to check each of them one by one ... maybe a finer tuned tagging could help in this view, like: math/geometry math/basic_arithmetic math/algebra and the same for physics thank you in advance ps: if my question is not clear, just ask me more details"425	Organizing project postings in ScratchEd	8/1/09 16:48	"Thinking about the couple postings asking for more ordered collections of math and physics projects has me wondering about how this can happen in ScratchEd. I put together a collection of map projects (gallery maps and Scratch, http://scratch.mit.edu/galleries/view/53737) but finding them felt a lot like hunt and peck typing.  It sounds like having searchable collections of curriculum-related projects would be helpful to educators.  Entering a project at a time here in ScratchEd would be a pain.  Any other ideas for ways to use or modify the structure to meet this need? Karen R."452	Plans for September?	8/11/09 21:19	The school year is starting up again. How will you be working with Scratch?456	Interested in Scratch curriculum development?	8/14/09 8:52	"Hi everyone, John Maloney sent along this RFP for curriculum development for Introduction to Computer Programming for Boys & Girls Clubs of America.

I just learned Scratch (briefly) at NECC09, and I need to teach it to my students. They are in high school, but this will be there first exposure to programming of any type, so I think it'll be fun. Does anyone have a curriculum that I could follow to help the students learn it step by step, and not just ""make it work"", but learn some of the why's and terminology? Or suggestions for which projects I should teach/have them learn first, second, etc. All suggestions are welcome! THANKS!"579	Workshop: Helping People Get Started with Scratch	8/22/09 21:04	"We just announced a free workshop that will be taking place Saturday, September 26 from 1-4pm at MIT Media Lab. Information below and at http://workshops.scratch.mit.edu What are different ways of helping people get started with Scratch? In this three-hour BYOL (Bring Your Own Laptop) workshop, we will discuss, develop, and document strategies for introducing Scratch to young people - and ways of working with Scratch over time. We will: discuss approaches and techniques for getting started with Scratch develop (and engage in) hands-on experiences with Scratch use ScratchEd to document the strategies we develop The workshop is open to all Boston-area Scratch educators, though some previous experience with Scratch is recommended. (We will be offering a hands-on workshop for beginners later this year.) Registration is limited to 25 people. The workshop is free, but your participation is not confirmed until we receive a $20 deposit check, payable to Lifelong Kindergarten at: Scratch Workshop c/o Lifelong Kindergarten 77 Massachusetts Ave. E15-020a Cambridge, MA 02139 Need more information? Email us at workshops@scratch.mit.edu"584	Word Cloud in Scratch?	8/23/09 10:37	"I am relatively new to Scratch and don't know all of the ways it can be used.  I was wondering if it can be used to create a Word Cloud, similar to Wordle.net (link) The process would be: 1.  get list of words 2.  count occurances of each word 3.  draw text horizontally or vertically with font proportional to number of occurances 3a.  make sure that text does not overlap Thanks for any advice!"633	Set up a Scratch server	8/26/09 15:31	"I received a question via email about how to share Scratch projects beyond the main Scratch site. In case others are also interested, here are the links I sent along. You can post your Scratch project on the Scratch site, but embed it in a different site. You can post your Scratch project, without having it on the Scratch site. You can also set up your very own Scratch site. ScratchR is the name of the Scratch site platform. People have discussed setting up ScratchR on the Scratch forums, here and here."656	Scratch on a Novell Network	8/28/09 10:01	"Greetings all - Here is a helpful summary of the steps required to install Scratch on a Novell Network,  generously provided by Bill Pickle from Bellevue Public Schools, Bellevue, NE. I'm posting it here so that School IT experts can find it... Hi, > > > I was asked to load Scratch on a Novell network that has netware6.5 servers. The instructions on your site do not include how to install and run Scratch in a Netware environment. We use the Netware Application Launcher (NAL) to deliver apps to userd. I got it to work and thought you might like to know how I did it. > > > Here is how I got it to work: > > > installed program on a windows workstation. copied the Scratch folder to the netware server. created an icon in the NAL. in the run options the path to file: (for example) \srv olderscratch.exe just below this line is Prameters: this must be set to \srv olderscratchscratch.image > > > Without the parameter set the program asks for the location of the .image file. The applications run from a hidden server share in our environment, so students can not browse to the app location."712	editing and related	9/2/09 10:53	"hello, i cannot do the proper formatting of my posts, as you have already realized ...; i'd like to insert itemized lists, links and wraps etc., the way i see you do; but how ??? i am very sorry for the bad appearance of my posts; thanks"748	dates for discussion comments	9/7/09 9:47	"Some feedback on following discussion threads. 1. I am having trouble following the sequence of discussion comments.  Any chance of having dates posted with each message? 2.  When the e-mail comes through with updates about new posts, there seem to be a lot of extra lines and repeated text--not as easy to sort out what goes with what, and thus what is interesting to follow up on , as the regular Scratch forum e-mail. All the editing tools are very helpful! Thanks, Karen R."751	Can Scratch do multi-user game ?	9/7/09 13:03	"In a multi-user game settings, typically each user has its own local state and exchange messages to update its own state.  I am not aware how these can be achieved in Scratch.  Or anyone can share their tricks ? The current programming model in powerful enough that a slight extension to a ""space"" scope should be sufficient to incorporate this capability. On top of ""variable of this sprite"" and ""variable of all sprites"", we add a scope: ""variable of all sprites in this space"". When broadcast a message, we add an option to broadcast to all sprites within the space. The communication among different players VM can happen via P2P or via a hosted message broker Does it make sense ?  Thoughts ? Rgds, Ricky http://horicky.blogspot.com"810	Game-making rubric?	9/14/09 15:13	"I'm teaching Scratch in my 6th grade computer class. The kids love it and are eagerly building the Fish game from the redware site. They will eventually design and build their own games. Does anyone have a rubric they've found successful for evaluating the games? I would like to put it out there as they start so they have some means to measure their progress. Thanks in advance, Bob in Lancaster, PA"836	Tons of Questions....	9/16/09 2:50	"I have a Games Design course for HS students, and I have a vision of having all 12 kids sitting at computers in our school network, writing games in Scratch. Then, at the end of the period, they upload their games to a gallery I have created called 'HKISgamers', where we can all access them and play each other's creations that night from our homes. But here's the rub. 1) I have created the gallery, made it public access, but how do I get my kids to be able to find it to contribute their work? There is no 'search galleries' function. 2) If three or four kids all try to log on to their Scratch accounts from different computers in our network, they end up being logged into someone else's account instead. Apparently, I cant have multiple users from a single network on line simultaneously. 3) When someone tries to upload their game, the screen goes dark and they are told that they are trying to do an impossible task and told to restart. I have a sneaking feeling that this is related to #2. How do I achieve my vision of having a  common, findable gallery where the kids can deposit their work while in school?

Thank you Mitch and Karen for you hospitality! I spent the 2 hour drive back to the bucolic Monadnocks thinking about what a powerful tool Scratch is. On the surface, it is so cool that kids can replicate and invent media experiences they are currently consuming... but the transformative aspect of the tool is all about shifting our mental models about what it means to be about a learner/creator. This tool might allow us to begin to ask different questions in the classroom mmm... ""What is interesting about this?"" When we heard the story about the math deficient student who had the number line, positive-negative numbers AHA moment making his Scratch, it was just another chiming bell reminding us that 1 size does not work. Let's advocate adding Scratch to a list of options to demonstrate mastery of a concept! I was also very attunned to the fact that, a la Prensky, most of us are digi immigrants. A HUGE factor in allowing tools like Scrach to become more ubiquitous and pervasive is the need to realign the teacher's head so that they don't need to understand the technical level of what is happening. My most satisfied teachers are as gee-whiz about the coolness factor of the final project as the kids AND they are happy to see the key learning objectives articulated in the Scratch project. The best teachers - keep their hands in their pockets and ask, ""What do you want to do with what you just observed?"" Lastly, the need for us to honor and respct that we are homo ludens. We play to learn. We need most to transform/unlearn the behaviors that most teachers are judged by. Defeat the bell, the segmentation by discipline and we start new trails of inquiry!"957	Scrolling Backgrounds	9/26/09 21:09	"OK, I heard someone, Peter, amybe. saying scrolling backgrounds were tough... so how do we do it? thxs"990	Anyone on Linked In?	9/30/09 23:18	"I started a group on Linked In (a professional networking site) for educators interested in teaching with Scratch. http://www.linkedin.com/groups?homeNewMember=&gid=2339178&trk=eml-grp-sub While I definitely think that Scratched should be the hub for discussions directly related to Scratch, Linked In seems to offer additional opportunities for professional networking.  Linked in is a website that helps people make and manage professional contacts.  This gives a more detailed intro to it: http://press.linkedin.com/ Best, Rick"1010	Speed of Loops	9/30/09 14:02	"If I have a forever statement with ""turn 1 degree"" inside, the sprite turns fairly slowly.  Is the speed at which the sprite spins  machine/microprocessor dependent?

To begin with, I need to decide how to focus my presentation.  Here are a few strands of thought I've considered: Exploring the parallells between games and traditional narratives, particularly how most State Standards of learning for literature can be taught through video games. Using Scratch as an new approach to reader response theory. Developing cross curricular projects (and helping humanities teachers tap into STEM funding streams) Teaching the process of composition with an emphasis on how new collaboration platforms and the fluidity of digital media change the traditional ""Plan, Draft, Revise, Edit, Publish""  approach. Exploring ""Kenetic Text"" and how Timing, Location, Color, and Font have an impact on the meaning of a text (expanding the definition of literacy). Creating relevant writing projects- Reviewing projects, Publishing a Scratch Newspaper, Producing a Scratch series. Integrating Scratch with Moodle. What would you want to learn more about? Which ideas need more clarificatioin?"1256	New Scratch Tutorial Needs Your Feedback	10/23/09 16:11	"Hi Scratch Peeps, I would love to hear your feedback on these 2 short Scratch Tutorials for beginners.

You can use a webcam to track things and use the tracking to a mousemove... I´ve had a two hour scratchclass with the students. And he had of course downloaded Scratch. And today he gave me the tip about camspace. I tried it when I came home.. and yes, it did the tracking.... I tried to use a small colored paper to be tracked and made a small scratchprogram with mouse x/y and I managed to move my scratchsprite with the colored paper... So I couldn´t resist to write in this forum... :) Now you can track everything, and use it in your scratchprogram.

I have an 18 year old son who can search for cheat codes on line, sort through the hits, copy the codes and enter them into his game console to change the parameters of his games (zelda, pokemon, final fantasy).  With a game controller in his hands, he can focus for hours.  In class, he can focus for minutes.  The reason he finally learned to read was in order to understand game dialog and walk through game guides.   His game skills have not transferred to any other aspect of his life. I think Scratch (and video gaming) could be doorways into computer literacy for students like my son who populate classrooms/schools separated from the mainstream because of unacceptable behaviors.  His future employment is likely to be cleaning offices or washing windows or shredding paper.  If he worked online, his behaviors would not be an issue.  His fine motor skills are impressive.  He wants to design video games but expects his first effort to look like something from Square Enix or Nintendo. Is anybody teaching Scratch to these students?  (My suspect credibility as Mom makes it hard for me to teach him Scratch --or anything else--at home.)  In a structured setting I think he would really enjoy using Scratch and uploading his projects for feedback would support his interest in becoming a video game designer.  How can we introduce Scratch to Special Education?"1864	Scratch text recommendations	12/8/09 9:56	"I'm looking for a good text on using Scratch in the classroom, similar to ""Learning To Program With Alice"" in the Alice language.  Sorry, but I wasn't so impressed with Scratch For Teens.  Let me know if there are others to look at.

Right now Scratch can recognize / control one motor.  One can hook two motors together and they will both do the same thing, but they cannot be controlled separately. I'd like to see the ability added to sense what is hooked up via usb and then have the ability to control it / them. This would extend to the sensors as well I suppose. On a non-Scratch note the Wedo tilt sensors are simply awful. At first I thought I had a dud, but the one from the second packet was just as bad. It is supposed to generate a number depending on which way the unit is tilted, but I think a random number generator would be just about as useful.   :-("2180	Bring SCRATCH to Illinois!!!	1/5/10 14:13	"Hi, I am Adam Slade, a graduate student in Public Policy and Adminstration at Northwestern University. I am a researcher for the IIlinois Economic Recovery Commission. This commission was set up so we could make recommendations to improve education to the IL governor. We are thinking of possibly doing a demo of Scratch for IL officials to increase its exposure and as a way to demonstrate how classrooms can use innovative programs in teaching. Is there any input from an educator/school adminstrator perspective about your experiences with Scratch that would be helpful? I have a few guiding questions... ? How it SCRATCH used by students? (in the curriculum, after school, supplementary work?) Are there ways of guiding students in the use of the program you have found helpful? Is there any training that needs to occur in the school to allow SCRATCH to be used? Are there any recommendations for distribution on a macro scale? Are there any adminstrative issues when using/implementing Scratch in school?

I have been working with the same group of students (third graders - age 8 and 9) for about one month.  I have been observing how students learn Scratch without any adult assistance.  (I just finished writing a paper about these observations [a qualitative research study]). My study was very similar to the Hole-in-the-Wall studies conducted in India - http://www.hole-in-the-wall.com/findings.html To my suggestion: The students have just started using the pre-made Scratch cards http://scratched.media.mit.edu/resources/scratch-cards.  I have noticed that many of the students who have Individualized Education Plans (special education students) are having a real hard time distinguishing between the Motion (blue), Looks (purple) Sound (purple shade) and Sensing (light blue) blocks of code.  The shades are too similar for many of them to make choices and they are getting frustrated. Has anyone else found this to be a problem?  If so, is there a way to change the color choices of the blocks of code?

The teacher said she has several students who are into computers.  Originally, I contemplated demonstrating some simple things with Scratch and giving the kids a link to the Scratch website, so they could try it out on their own.  The teacher, who has taken programming courses, suggested I let the kids type in a program into Windows Notepad.  I told her about Scratch and suggested we use it, instead. So, she downloaded and tried Scratch, and arranged to install Scratch on 26 computers so her class of 33 students could have a hands-on experience with Scratch.  Obviously, there's a world of difference between demonstrating Scratch and leading what is essentially a lab class with Scratch;  I'm somewhat intimidated. I would like to give the kids the basic idea of a step-by-step algorithm with loops.  But, I don't want to make it so complicated that the kids get bogged down or bored.  I'm thinking about leading the kids through Scratch Getting Stated.  I'd be very grateful for any suggestions on good activities for this presentation, comments on what to expect, warnings of problems to be prepared for, etc."2356	Community Ed Classes	1/20/10 18:48	I'm working on developing a Scratch class for the local community education center.  I've been thinking it would be good to do maybe a couple of hours for two consecutive weeks.  Does anyone have experience teaching kids with a format like this?  I see a lot of lesson plans that are around 8 or so lesson plans.

Scratch in 2nd-5th	1/22/10 11:32	"Hi! I'm new here. I'm teaching Scratch in computer classes to my 2nd-3rd grade class (8 students) and my 4th-5th grade class.  I started teaching Scratch about two weeks ago and I have to say that Scratch is the most exciting thing that I've ever taught.  The enthusiasm is amazing and I can't believe some of the projects that they have posted in such a short time. I don't have many specific requirements in curriculum from the school other than getting in some typing and newsletter writing somewhere, so I'm here to get whatever suggestions I can. Although I've taught a fair amount of private music lessons and done a bit of corporate education classes in technology, this sort of classroom teaching is new to me this school year.  I teach computers to K-5 two days a week.  My full time gig is as a smart phone developer with Nokia, who I see is mentioned as having a connection to Lifelong Kindergarten.

For our implementation of OLPC I have made an offline library system so that the library works over the school LAN. I have just written a scratch downloader program in Java that given the ID of a gallery will download all the projects in that Gallery, their thumbnail, and description.  Works pretty nice so far - downloaded over a thousand scratch programs to our external server in Germany in around 2 hrs, and can then download them overnight to Afghanistan.  I can then make that work with the Nutch search engine so that we can then search through the contents. I'm just digging into exelearning (www.exelearning.org) at the moment which is quite a nice framework for making curriculum e-learning material and I'm developing in Python an iDevice for this to make it easier to add Scratch projects to enhance curriculum materials. I'm also wondering about how we are going to share the localization work that we do on the projects that demonstrate the curriculum content.  Possibly we could upload the project as a remix and we could write a program to automatically do this in batch overnight.

How do we know that they know besides looking at a program that they create? Are there other ways to assess their learning? What questions should we be asking/investigating?

I have come up with a simple method of simulating this using Scratch by simply taking a character and making a copy of it and then erasing parts of the copy to just leave the mouth. The pupils can then record a narration (or import an Audacity recording that has been altered to change ptich and/or speed) and then play the narration followed by a simple loop to change the fisheye effect of the mouth. It does not give the full effect that you get using CrazyTalk but its not a bad substitution for free and is very easy for pupils to achieve once they've learnt the basics of Scratch. Here is a link to an example made by a pupil http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/SimpleScratch/921551 and here is a modified version with the same effect added to the eyes http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/SimpleScratch/921513 regards Simon"3100	Technical Reviewer Needed; Scratch Book	3/16/10 19:32	"I'm an editor at No Starch Press, an independent technical publisher based in San Francisco.

My question is, what are the opitons for actual commercialization of projects.  It has some interesting potential for just plain creating interactive educational applications.  By this I mean not distributing the project and Scratch, but rather just put the project itself (run only) online. To do this I'd be looking at adding some extensions, such as being able to talk to an LMS so that student activites could be recorded for example.  Not a huge problem given the source is available.

I am working on a project called ""LG Global Challenger."" This program is expedition program for university students supported by LG(one of the biggest company in Korea). Students freely choose the expedition theme and country, and visit  'world's excellent sites'. Since its first introduction in 1995, it became the major overseas expedition program most popular among university students with the competitive rate of 20:1 every year. And I am preparing for this with a teme realted to Educational Pragramming Language. and we need to make a report about our expedition plan. There are 4 memebers in my team. and i am wondering if you can let me know some schools having a Scratch Program. If our report are accepted, we would like to visit the places and get more information about adapting Educational Programming Language in Korea education system. Please let me know if your schools are using Scratch as a study tool and if it's possible to visit the place. Thank you for your help ^^"3573	What a Seasoned Professional has to Learn from Scratch	4/21/10 15:18	"Todays modern programming platforms generally hand you the world on a silver platter. Typically all you have to do is peice all the right components together logically to create a solution to a problem. When creating complex solutions in Scratch, I have had to create my own data structures. Examples: Using a one dimensional list like a two dimensional list to create a matrix Using a list as a stack to store and idententies and locations of sprites which are shooting in a game Using variables to store a unique identifiers so that a sprit can be identifed and dynamic messages can be created to manipulate a groups of sprites Using list to store a ID's of active and inacvtive sprites Working in Scratch also demonstrates the difficulties in working with and syncronizing multiple threads of execution and the issues involved with variable access from multiple threads of execution. The limited (while at the same time powerful) nature of Scratch forces one to examine the solution to a problem in fine detail and to create many things from scratch (no pun intended). For the first time in years I have found myself programming for pleasure. It is the challenge of finding solutions to complex problems and being able to examine the solutions that others have created in solving similar problems, that make working in Scratch so enjoyable. I am looking forward to a workshop that I am giving to GT students on April 24th, 2010 and hope that at least one of my students gets the programming bug after their experience in my workshop. I have pushed Scratch and my own skills to the limit to prepare myself to be able to answer all of their questions accurately and intellegently."3672	Looking to Hire Scratch Educator in NYC	4/20/10 14:59	"Hello Scratch Community!

I'm wondering whether any of the teachers here have had negative experiences with their students and the Scratch community and how they have handled it.  What happened to me on the surface doesn't seem that strong compared to what goes on elsewhere on the internet but it has dampened and tarnished Scratch at our school.  I am hoping that others might help me know how best to respond to the situation, since I am just a volunteer teacher and my experience at classroom teaching is limited. I was the one to set up teaching Scratch at my school.  I had each student in 2-5 set up a Scratch account using their first name only followed by the initial of our school.  I asked them not to post their photos and to mindful that things were somewhat public online.  It didn't occur to me that perhaps I should have gathered permission from parents ahead of time.  It didn't seem much different to me, in concern, than having the students access National Geographic and similar sites online.  There are only about fifty students in the entire school and the other teachers are not very involved with computers so, although they had heard me rave about Scratch, they probably did not think too much about it later and thought, I found out later, that I had more control of the situation than I actually could have. Overall, the students have been very enthusiastic about Scratch and some do it at home as well, which I basically thought was a good thing. However, for whatever reason, one of the older boys commented on a project of another Scratch student somewhere in the USA saying that their project was ""lame"".  I don't know whether he made this comment from home or while he was in my classroom.  The first I heard about it was when I found the teachers and students very upset that the student at the other school had, in return, posted a comment to my student's project containing mild profanities at the quality of my student's project. I was called on the carpet by the teachers that operate the school.  They couldn't believe that I would expose the students to something where they might receive comments like this.  They also couldn't believe that I would put the students in a situation where I wasn't reviewing each comment they received before they could read it.  I was told that the situation was completely unacceptable and that the parents would never tolerate it. We were on vacation break for a week and today I submitted a parent approval form for Scratch which I had put together, referring to the website and speaking of the benefits of the program, explaining how the community operated in a generally positive manner and asking their permission.  I gave the form to the head teacher and she said that she needed time to review it with the other teachers and I am to refrain from teaching Scratch until the other teachers come to a decision.  I'm not really a participating member of the teachers' group since I am just a volunteer teacher two mornings a week.  In the past, I think I have generally been on good terms with the regular teachers, so I will wait and hope that we will be able to continue using Scratch in some form. How have the rest of you handled situations like this?  I feel really terrible about doing anything negative towards the students, particularly on issues concerning safety and self-esteem.  My wife, who has much more teaching experience than me, though compared it like this.  What if my student on the playground had yelled out through the fence to some driver passing by that their driving was lame?  Then perhaps that driver might respond with a curse or similar.  In this case the driver would actually have seen the student.  Would the playground supervisor be responsible and in what way? Are there some materials on a Scratch site that might give me some guidance on issues with classroom safety and parents? Thanks."3909	Now accepting CS4HS applications	5/5/10 9:27	"We're really excited to be hosting the CS4HS / Creative Computing workshop again this year, July 22-24 at MIT Media Lab.

Regards, Manuel"4110	Terminology	5/17/10 2:08	"I have over four decades of experience with computers so I'm not fazed by jargon and terminology, but I'm interested in suggestions that you may have concerning the terminology to use with young people learning Scratch. 1. Do you ""run"" or ""execute"" a program? ""Execute"" sounds rather macabre and computer don't ""run"" anywhere unless you pick up your laptop and run with it! The Scratch RG uses ""run"" but I've seen learning material that uses ""execute"". Any other alternatives? 2. Do you use the word ""program"", either as a noun or a verb? The RG seems to avoid it and limit itself to ""project"" as a noun and ""create"" as a verb. 3. There seems to be a problem with too much overloading of the word ""block"". Clearly, a ""block"" is the physical unit used to write a program (analogous to ""token"" in an ordinary programming language), but the RG seems to use it additionally for ""instruction""/""statement"", and, of course, many blocks are used for expressions, variables and so on. I'd appreciate hearing of your experience with different terminology, Moti"4196	Detecting copying?	5/21/10 16:50	"How do you find out how much of a Scratch project has come from someone else?

We've run into a few problems having to do with schools using a single IP address, so I thought I'd post about them here. If anyone has thoughts or ideas for solutions, we'd love to hear them! As with all websites that allows sharing of user generated content, the Scratch website has to have a means of blocking sources of disrespectful or otherwise inappropriate material. We can do this by blocking accounts, but of course it's very easy to make a new one.  In cases where users make multiple accounts to troll or post disrespectful content (usually mean or unconstructive comments), we resort to blocking access from the offending account's network or IP address. In many cases this works well - the source is blocked, and the user is invited to send us an email to discuss the situation and ask to be unblocked.  However, when the source of the inappropriate comments or content is a student from a school that uses a single external IP address, we are often forced to block many more users than we would like to. Often schools use a single external IP address through which all requests to and from the internet are funneled. This means that if we are forced to block access from this IP address, the entire school gets blocked.  When entire school districts share a single IP address, the situation is even worse.  We end up having to block an entire school district's access because one student on one computer in one classroom was acting inappropriately. Unfortunately, it's hard to find a good solution to this problem from our end.  The centralized architecture of a school or schools sharing a single IP address leaves us with no alternative but to block the access of many classrooms to prevent access from a single user. If you have any ideas about ways to better address this issue, we'd love to hear them!  If this issue has affected your school in the past,  perhaps you can send a link to this post to your IT specialists, so they can consider this scenario."4283	ISTE Meetup	5/26/10 11:32	"Are you going to ISTE 2010 in Denver?

I am writing this to introduce my current research on Scratchers’ information-related behaviors, and also ask your help in recruiting study participants. I found Scratch to be an exemplary place to observe new and innovative youth information behavior—i.e., the ways kids seek, evaluate, use, share, and create information—to enhance their learning or pursue personal and aesthetic growth in the digital age. I am currently conducting my dissertation research, which aims to illuminate innovative patterns of youth information behavior in the digital age, with particular focus on the ways youth interact with technologies to access and use information and to create new knowledge. As part of the research, I am investigating information behaviors of Scratchers, which I believe are prerequisites for participating effectively in Scratch activities. I am seeking young people with various ages under 19 who have participated in Scratch for individual interviews. ·       Preference: Youth who have worked to create Scratch project cooperatively ·       When: October 2010 at a time convenient to interview participants ·       Where and how: o   Face to face interviews for Boston area youth o   Online interviews for other areas (via Instant Messaging, Skype, or other online communication tools) ·       Benefits: $20 gift card per interview participant and educator who helps recruiting their kids (e.g., by distributing and collecting parent consent form and youth assent form) I am attending Scratch@MIT this August, and hoping that I can meet any of you who are interested in my study.

I'm switching from several year of working with MicroWorlds and its Logo language-syntax-based programming to Scratch this fall. I'm trying to create a ""skateboarding / snowboarding"" animation, and I want to hide or show one sprite and one background, for either type of recreation.  But in Scratch, the button sprite won't show a ""change background"" and I'm having trouble with designating the ""hide"" or ""show"" commands to a specific sprite.  In MicroWorlds, for example, I could write a program for a button such as: to go_to_snowboarding page2 show ""skateboarding button"" hide ""snowboarding button"" end Then I would create a parallel but reversed procedure and button, to toggle back and forth between the two pages. I'm sure this is easy to do, but I've been unable to figure it out on my own. Thanks for any advice you all might offer.

I am teaching at a new school this year as a K-6 ""enrichment specialist."" The school's population is high-poverty (97%)-low-test-scoring and most of the day for students focuses on reading and math instruction.  I've been hired to combine science, art, and technology in a class that takes place during the regular teacher's prep time, rotating with 4 other prep teachers through the year.  I'll see some grades 14 times over the year, and others about 45 times.  The overall goal is to promote deeper thinking, creativity, and inquiry, and Scratch will be a big help! I would like to find a way to assess where the kids are now and see what impact the class has had at the end of the year.  I can make rubrics for Scratch projects or track changes in a few kids' approaches.  I am curious, though, whether there is any sort of measurement instrument or accepted practice out there that addresses overall problem solving or creativity.  Several of you have written about your research projects and I wonder whether you found a way to quantify data for a whole class or school of kids, one that would also be practical for a teacher to administer.  Obervational data would be hard to collect because I'm in the moment teaching.

Two ideas behind this project are that adults learn by processing experiences and that to really implement change in classroom practice, it helps to have on-going support. The group keeps a private wikispaces site to record minutes of our conversations and keep in touch between meetings. The meeting format is generally an hour long conference call focused on a topic.  We start with check-ins from everyone and try to end with a reflection on the topic and the meeting from everyone. To deal with time zone challenges, last year we met on Sundays at 1:00 GMT, but this year's group could look for a different common time. For last year's collaborative project, students from five schools passed along a remix project about the foods they eat at special celebrations. ( http://scratch.mit.edu/galleries/view/74573) We've talked about trying a storytelling project this year, but nothing is decided yet. Here are links to the notes from a few of our conversations, posted on Scratch-Ed: http://scratched.media.mit.edu/resources/scratch-plc-conversation-1-lesson-design http://scratched.media.mit.edu/resources/scratch-plc-conversation-2-teaching-programming-concepts http://scratched.media.mit.edu/resources/scratch-plc-conversation-3-integrating-scratch-subject-areas If this sounds like fun to you or if you have questions, send me an e-mail: .  At the end of the month, we'll have a session on Skype to see how the group wants to organize this year.

My students and I have noticed really inconsistent collision detection between sprites. For instance, if a program a dragon sprite to bounce off a prince sprite, the dragon doesn't bounce off the prince's edge. Sometimes it appears like the dragon bounces off the prince's centerpoint, or sometimes not at all. Does anyone know the inner workings of Scratch's collision detection? A lot of the time, we've just switched to detect colors as a way to get around this."6561	Need Advanced Scratch Project Ideas for AP Class	9/17/10 14:32	"I have used Scratch with my AP class for the last 3 years; we study it for a few weeks because none of my students have any prior programming experience. Well, today my students just tore through learning the interface and were already modifying some of the example games, like Pong, figuring out random behavior and broadcasts completely on their own.

Easy ways to learn and so on... But then I came across this little confusing topic with a Sprite and it´s directions... I mean I understand it, but... I draw naturally a Sprite with direction pointing upwards (my little bug). But when I use direction in my script the direction must be 90. Isn´t it more natural to think 0 was pointing upwards. No big deal, but when you explane to the children, when they are going to move this little bug and face the bug to the right, and left and so on... it starts to be a little bit confusing. If the bug is going up direction is 90 (right), and if it´s down -90 (left)... Maybe I am missing something obvious... And the Snow we got yesterday... is melting, raining today. So it might be natural with up to the right and down to the left... ;) Have a nice weekend, Anders"8155	How do I reset a project in scratch if using the control when flagged clicked?	11/12/10 11:02	I'm teaching fifth graders and wondering if there is any easy way to reset the project besides just draggin them to the center of the stage each time?

I believe that Scratch is not only a terrific learning environment it is also a great tool to demonstrate the advantages of computer programming to educators. For example, just as Scratch demonstrates to the user why variables are useful in a concrete way, Scratch demonstrates to administrators and educators what computer programming can offer.

So, I'm asking the ScratchEd group.  Here's a few ideas of projects that I think could be possible using the communication capability.  Do you think they have educational uses?  (Note that these projects would require an external program running in the background to coordinate the communications.) Scratch Chat - 2 computers (within same local area network) could have a text chat via Scratch.  Maybe the chat could appear as 2 sprites talking to each other. Weather Station - the external program could pull weather data from a website and feed it to Scratch.  Students programs could collect / graph / analyze some weather parameter. WebSnatch - OK, dumb name.  The idea here is that the external program could periodically access a website and look for a keyword, then return something back to Scratch that the students could use for something (pretty vague definition!). File Access - the communication capability could be used as a simple file read / write system to allow Scratch programs to save / restore data (maybe from / to a list). Is there educational value to such projects?  Or maybe these ideas have got your creative juices flowing and you have a better idea.  Either way, I'd like to hear your feedback.

The post and instructions below has been deprecated in favour of a much simpler setup. The new setup uses Windows 7 and the MS Kinect SDK and my free program Kinect2Scratch available on http//scratch.saorog.com I'd love for you to try it out and give me some feedback! Regards, Stephen Hi everyone, Thought some of you might be interested in my page on how to use your Kinect with Scratch: http://stephen-howell.tumblr.com The Kinect is a great add-on for the XBox 360. Many people had their doubts, and although core gamers will decry the Kinect, it can be really good fun to play around with. Literally, you are the controller. There has been some interest in hacking the Kinect to work with computers other than the XBox, and there are drivers available now to use with Windows, MacOSX and Linux. I became interested in coding Processing to work with the Kinect, but soon became disheartened when it appeared that bone data (or joint positions) were not readily available, instead only 3D depth data (cool but not enough) was readable. Then I found the OpenNI drivers (see links below) and the OSC server from Sensebloom. They were able to send joint data encoded as OSC commands to Processing, and I wrote up my own little Processing receiver to test it. It worked so well, I delved into their C++ code to see if I could send the same data to Scratch. When I couldn’t see a way for Scratch to interpret the OSC code, I read about the remote sensing over the network that Scratch allows. This was perfect; I could send Scratch commands from a C program which was reading joint data from the Kinect. So after making a few Scratch proof-of-concept games to test it, I decided to release it all for you guys to test out. You will need: A standalone Kinect (one bought without a console) OR a Kinect that came in a console bundle and the separately available USB plug to connect it to your PC A Windows PC (other versions can be made by coders familiar with coding on OSX or Linux) The OpenNI.org drivers installed The OpenNI2Scratch program Scratch Some Kinect aware Scratch programs. Here are a few: Skeleton, Ball Bounce and Space Invaders (Links to all of these are available on the tumblr page mentioned above) Once you’ve set that up, you have to connect the Kinect to your PC and wait for the drivers to install. Then run the OpenNI2Scratch program. Run Scratch, execute the Scratch program you want to control. Calibrate the Kinect - this involves standing a fair bit back from it and standing in a ‘calibration pose’ for a few seconds - see picture on site. Once the program has detected you, it will send the joint positions to Scratch. After that, see the variables on the sample Scratch programs to see how to use the joint data. Enjoy.

We wanted to announce it here because it's a great opportunity to give kids motivation to work together to create a project. The only real constraints are that the project has to include three particular sprites and it has to be done as a team of at least 2 people. In addition, there are some dates to pay attention to. Wednesday, Feb. 9, is the deadline for participants to upload a project. The projects will receive constructive comments from the Scratch Design Team, and then everyone will have a chance to revise and polish their projects before the final deadline of Mar. 2. What a great opportunity to get feedback from the Design Team and to encourage kids to revise their work! For myself, I'm leading a small, informal workshop where we'll be doing the Collab Challenge as a focus of the group. It has both new and more experienced youth, and so far the kids seem excited.

They are not able to upload projects at school. They work on something and have no way to get back to it the next day. I'm thinking they should upload projects to their Scratch pages and then download them to work on them the next class. Is that what schools do? How can I troubleshoot the uploading problem? Any suggestions are most appreciated!8927	Clock Face	1/25/11 10:58	"Hi, I need to teach an example of how to make a sprite (say a person standing) move around a clock face in sixty seconds. I know how to set the clock face up etc etc but I'm having trouble rotating the sprite, ie keeping the feet static in the middle but making the head and body move around the clock in 6 degree steps every second. Can any body help me please?"8959	"Arduino, Modkit, Scratch supportive simulation"	1/27/11 12:44	"Hi guys, I work for SparkFun Electronics. I recently posted an Arduino teaching tool I have been working on in my free time here:  http://scratch.mit.edu/galleries/view/110387 It's a little complicated if you don't have experience with Arduino or Scratch or a similar product, but read the project notes for some quick instructions if you are interested. It is a ruff draft and I posted it in the hopes that other educators would understand the idea and download for further development. Feel free to use it however you like and please post any improvements to the gallery. Dedicated to educating- Linz"8965	I wish I can drive two motors with the WeDo interface...	1/28/11 9:40	"I am not sure if this is the right area to post this question/suggestions -- is there a way to drive two motors with the standard wedo setup? We have just started using the WeDo board with Scratch, and often wish we can have dual axis control... Any creative ideas? P.K."8972	Finding each other	1/29/11 0:58	"I'm wondering how you find each other if you are a class working online in the Scratch community? When I posted my first project, I had comments literally within the hour and it was awesome. My students made their own accounts and are excited to participate in the community but I'd also like them to be leaving comments for each other. I'm thinking of creating a Google Site and listing all of the user pages for the class. Is there a way to create a ""group"" right in the Scratch community that would do the same thing? How have others accomplished this same goal? Thanks!"8981	Implement browser functions in Scratch project?	1/30/11 7:07	"Is it possible to implement a basic browser function in an uploaded Scratch project?

We have now started to look at scratch programs from a software engineering point of view trying to see if it is possible to define quality metrics for scratch programs. See http://artentnu.wordpress.com/2010/12/17/how-can-we-assess-the-quality-of-scratch-projects/ At this stage I wonder if there exist a possibility, given a scratch program, to generate statistics about its code (like number of control statements, number of variables, number of sound pieces, etc.). I also wonder if there are related attempts to define the quality of scratch programs. I am aware that quality is a relative attribute that must be defined according to a goal, but given 1.5 M scratch programs available it would be great if we had a way to select the best ones for teaching purposes, the best for visual aestetics, etc. Regards, Ivete"9086	"Scratch Educator Meetup @ MIT: Saturday, February 19, 2011"	2/10/11 20:55	"It's time for the monthly Scratch educator meetup at MIT -- hope to see you there!

When everyone logged in, they were logged in as other students in the room. We cleared the history, cache, everything we could find. We quit the browsers (Safari and Firefox). We restarted the computers and 28 people all had the same problem!! As I said, this was day 12 and we've never had this problem before! What could it be? They put the comments in a Google Doc for today and will copy and paste them in the right user when we get this problem fixed. The fact that everyone was signed in just fine in our Google Apps domain makes me think this is something with Scratch. Thanks!"9109	Scratch courses for educators	2/15/11 14:55	"Hello, i'm interested in courses (a week-long or similar) where i might get in touch with the forefront in Scratch usage in education and other international educators. I especially search courses during my vacation period (June-August), possibly in the EU. If no courses in the EU, i can try to manage a travel to the US anyway. Thank you in advance !"9139	"Reflections on Scratch Educator Meetup @ MIT: Saturday, February 19, 2011"	2/19/11 20:32	"Thanks to everyone who was able to join us at MIT for today's Scratch educator meetup! Some notes, reflections, and next steps... 1. Things we saw in Show & Tell I love Show & Tell because I'm always surprised and always learn something new. Here's what we heard in today's Show & Tell session: Lorraine Leo shared some of her students' projects, and details of her Scratch Day collaboration with Yoshiro Miyata of Japan. Vicki Gold shared some of the projects her students have been creating, including a challenging project by superzipzop! In the process, we learned how to save scripts as pictures (right-clicking or control-clicking on the Scripts area) and how to write summary of a project to a text file (shift-clicking the ""File"" menu and selecting the ""Write Project Summary"" menu item). Lisa Radden shared her experiences with the TechSperts program, including her blog where students are posting their Scratch reflections. Sandra Bleecker, Janet Dee, and Vicki Gold demonstrated a project they co-created during today's meetup - an interactive recording/playback drawing project. A nice collaboration that I hope they'll post and share a link to! 2. For the beginners I had a lot of fun working with the people who were having their very first Scratch experiences. Here are some resources that you might want to check out, to support your further explorations with Scratch. Getting started guide - How to make a first Scratch project. Scratch cards - Twelve cards that illustrate a basic Scratch technique (such as keeping score or playing with graphic effects). Design studio activities - 16 suggestions for design activities, such as making a project that includes the ""random"" block or making a project that has an orange square and purple circle. Creative computing workshop - This is something I just finished -- I haven't event posted the sum as a resource on ScratchEd yet! This is a sequence of activities for getting started with Scratch. Any feedback on the sequence and activities would be appreciated. How could it be changed to be more useful? 3. Future events There are lots of ways to keep participating in ScratchEd professional development: Hang out on ScratchEd Come to the monthly meetups - Register for next month's meetup and be notified about future events through the quarterly newsletter. Attend the monthly webinars - The next webinar is all about Scratch Day and is taking place on Monday, February 28 at 7pm EST. 4. What's next? We asked people to record their thoughts about what might be next for them and might be next for our next meetup. Here's what was shared on sticky notes: Experimenting! teaching my own kids Playing/learning more about Scratch, so I can teach to others More in-depth with PicoBoard Go home today and play; get lessons for ELA project I came in today knowing NOTHING about Scratch. I am excited now to brainstorm & look @ other people's projects to see how I can use it, specifically w/my young students. After this workshop I hope to learn how to further develop what I have learned and bring it into my curriculum. Recruit more teachers to attend next teacher meetup Going back and completing the online tutorial, then apply! Keep playing with Scratch, get more comfortable, so I can teach it. Collaborate with other classes. Get more knowledge, meet more new Scratchers Next meeting: learn more advanced skills Have Modkit creator as part of groupBring a friend to next meetup Modkit break out group Thanks again for attending today's event.

Things we saw in Show & Tell Videos of the Show & Tell presentations will be posted later this week. In the meantime, here are some notes: Rosemary Slattery shared some great student work. First, she showed a project that one of her students made, based on the Orange Square, Purple Circle activity. This student took the orange square, purple circle activity in an unexpected direction by creating a musical guessing game, programming songs note-by-note. You can check out his project online at http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/BBoyRiser/1655816. Rosemary also shared the St. Patrick's Day themed mazes her students had created, such as http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/LucKy_LKY/1661821 Sandie Bleecker shared her ongoing explorations with the PicoBoard. She described how she turned to her own kids for ideas -- and how they co-developed a PicoBoard-based joystick. Janet Dee talked about the power of students sharing their work with each other and building on each other's work. She shared a particular example -- Jimmy's circus game -- and how that project evolved with different people's contributions Abby Miller shared handouts that she had developed to support her students getting started with Scratch -- and talked about her surprise when the students did everything other than what was on the handouts. :) I thought this led to a great discussion about structure and support. 2. For the beginners If yesterday was your first experience with Scratch (or you want a refresher), here are some resources that you might want to check out, to support your further explorations with Scratch. Getting started guide - How to make a first Scratch project. Scratch cards - Twelve cards that illustrate a basic Scratch technique (such as keeping score or playing with graphic effects). Design studio activities - 16 suggestions for design activities, such as making a project that includes the ""random"" block or making a project that has an orange square and purple circle. Creative computing workshop - This is a sequence of activities for getting started with Scratch. Any feedback on the sequence and activities would be appreciated. How could it be changed to be more useful? 3. Intermediate breakout I really enjoyed the intermediate breakout session. We sat around and discussed a wide range of topics: debugging, remixing, broadcasting, and more. For debugging, we spent some time discussing what debugging is and strategies for debugging. Here's a list of strategies that we developed in the course of our discussion (which involved looking at debugging activities, talking about our own experiences, and trying debug a student's project): use storyboards to think about the steps that would be involved talk through goals and approach explain to someone else what you want to have happen peer editing being incremental testing in a modular way examine how different stacks of code get started print out the scripts to see them side by side put ""markers"" in the code, debugging flag think about properties of the tool (e.g. rotation, costume center) annotate your work with comments single stepping (""Start single stepping"" under the Edit menu, which highlights what blocks are being run) For remixing (taking someone else's project, changing it, and sharing the modified -- or ""remixed"" -- version), we looked at remixes of a project ""For the people of Japan"". Under any remixed project, there's a count of the remixes, which is a link to a visualization of the remixes, like this one. 4. Future events There are lots of ways to keep participating in ScratchEd professional development: Hang out on ScratchEd Come to the monthly meetups - Register for next month's meetup and be notified about future events through the quarterly newsletter. Attend the monthly webinars - The next webinar is all about computational concepts and is taking place on Monday, March 28 at 7pm EST. More hands-on Scratch - I'll be facilitating a hands-on Scratch workshop this Thursday from 1pm to 5pm at the ICA, if you're interested in getting more Scratch practice. 5. What's next? We asked people to record their thoughts about what might be next for them and might be next for our next meetup. Here's what was shared on sticky notes: I'm going to make my own Scratch cards and a rubric (or several) for evaluating student projects. Next for me - learn through creating projects. Would love to see samples or examples of operators and sensing palettes. Next for me - to organize what I learned from leading the Scratch teacher professional development. Challenges - What's next! Next meetup: Try to create a new project with support, after playing on my own for a month. Exploring use of Scratch project remixes. Next for meetup: More of everything. Get colleagues on board. I would like to see other people's materials and ""trade"" projects, assignments, ideas, rubrics, handouts, etc. I'm interested in the incorporation of media elements. Also, understanding how to integrate procedures from small projects into programs. Thanks again for attending today's event.

In the past few years, there has been a growing recognition of the importance of computational thinking for understanding and solving problems in a wide range of contexts, not only in the field of computer science. As young people program and share Scratch projects, they begin to develop as computational thinkers: they learn core computational and mathematical concepts, while also learning important strategies for designing, problem solving, and collaborating. In this first of three webinars focused on computational thinking, we will focus on computational thinking concepts (sequences, loops, parallelism, events, conditionals, operators, variables, and lists). All webinars will be recorded and shared on ScratchEd.

Everyone shared the project in a group, edited it and when it is presented again to the group, it will be with a Scratch Card from the project that can be shared. We'd like to start a ""folder"" with these homemade cards so that others could add to the collection and we could improve the first draft of the cards by making suggestions to each other.  How to do it? We imagine a pdf - that's created from a Google Docs template. It could also have a short video clip of some sort that showed only the part of the project described by the card's blocks. Is there a space already on the Scratch site where we could post these and others could find them and add to them? It would also be good if we could have a conversation around each card. Any ideas?"9388	What are the worst Scratch programming practices ?	3/23/11 14:20	"I would like to get good programming habits to my students. So, I though about asking the community about Best Practices. But I feel that it will be easier to identify the bad stuff (and then pair it with the holy version). So, what are the worst things that we see in your projects ? I beleive that those qualify: - leaving instructions floating in the script zone - attaching the scripts to the wrong sprite (there we are: I can tell that it is the wrong sprite - but it is much harder to tell the right one, isn't it?) - undue nesting of conditions ... thanks,"9410	Advocating for Scratch	3/27/11 11:27	"I had the pleasure of sitting in on the monthly Scratch professional learning community that was spearheaded by Karen Randall. (You can check out notes from prior meetings on ScratchEd here, here, and here.) Many interesting threads were explored, but one that I thought would be particularly interesting to bring to ScratchEd is around advocacy, as raised by Patrice Gans. That is, if you're excited about Scratch, how do you help others understand that excitement and express what young people get out of participating? One path is to talk with young people and see how they describe about what they're doing: What do the young people you work with say about their Scratch experiences? How could those reflections help advocate for Scratch?"9436	Second year of Scratch in Moodle	3/31/11 2:34	"Just finished my second year working with my Scratch unit in Moodle. Our session this year ran a full nine weeks. I had some pretty good projects and a lot of ... well, unfinished projects, (lack of completion of work in all subjects seems to be school-wide, so I wouldn't blame Scratch). Because of Scratch and Moodle abilities to enable students to work together, I had my first cooperative project that two boys were able to complete despite being in two different classes. I posted what I thought were our best projects on my class pages. As I have emptied all student data/work out of my class, I have created a user that members of ScratchED can use to log on and look at the course. My course is not perfect, it needs updating and reconfiguring, changes I made this year helped the flow of the course, but I know I can do better. It is also structured for a course that can be posted on our Blackboard portal, (all schools in NM have access to a Blackboard portal), hopefully I can put it on Blackboard next year, (I love Moodle, but I would rather teach than maintain a server when I don't have to). Moodle Site: http://www.chaparralmiddle.us/moodle/login/index.php ID: tempuser Password: tempuser1 I am open to any suggestions for improving the unit. I tried to have students work on understanding and creating algorithms and reading/following directions, (working more independently).

Personally I have extensive undergrad academic experience with Java, although I don't have the mindset for it and dislike programming. I am not very good at it. However, at the 8th grade level I think that I could get by. Is Scratch something that I could use to introduce students to the concepts of programming? I have also heard about Alice. What are the main differences between Scratch and Alice? If Scratch is for me, how do I go about getting some training / direction so that I could develop a few units in programming for my class? We are limited to about 10 weeks per class. I’m not sure if I could get approval to spend the full 10 weeks on programming. Do you have a recommended amount of time that I could get through a good unit or two with a nice deliverable or project to show for the efforts at the end? The Computer Studies program has traditionally had a bad reputation among students. I am trying to find some way to make it more interesting to students, especially at the 8th grade level. Typically, projects they can do with minimal talking from me is ideal. This class should be fun! Any advice, guidance, assistance you can offer is greatly appreciated."9562	Scratch contests?	4/15/11 17:15	What sort of scratch competitions have people tried?  One of the regulars at ScratchDay (can we say that after 2 years?) suggested a Scratch Race - give a challenge and see who can solve it the quickest.  Has anyone tried anything like that? We are trying to come up with activities to connect with the advanced scratchers in the area.9578	"Reflections on Scratch Educator Meetup @ MIT: Saturday, April 16, 2011"	4/17/11 20:38	"Thanks to everyone who was able to join us at MIT for yesterday's Scratch educator meetup! Here are some notes, reflections, and next steps... 1. Things we saw in Show & Tell Videos of the Show & Tell presentations will be posted later this week. In the meantime, here are some notes: Tom Kowalczyk shared some of the work that he's doing in the domain of K-12 workforce development. Anushka Paul shared the project she developed during the meetup, based on the collision game from the Let's Play handouts. Abby Miller shared resources that she developed for her students (step-by-step and Scratch puzzles) and will hopefully share on ScratchEd! Jesse Raymond shared a space-themed project he created that models gravity. 2. For the beginners After showing various sample projects to demonstrate the possibilities of Scratch creation, we had an hour and a half of hands-on time with Scratch. The suggested activity was to create an interactive collage, but several different paths were explored including trying out the Scratch card activities and checking out the Scratch sample projects that come with Scratch (e.g. Simple Circuits). If yesterday was your first experience with Scratch (or you want a refresher), here are some other resources that you might want to check out, to support your further explorations with Scratch. Getting started guide - How to make a first Scratch project. Design studio activities - 16 suggestions for design activities, such as making a project that includes the ""random"" block or making a project that has an orange square and purple circle. Creative computing workshop - This is a sequence of activities for getting started with Scratch. Any feedback on the sequence and activities would be appreciated. How could it be changed to be more useful? 3. Intermediate breakout Those with more experience followed a few different tracks, but several people got together to explore Scratch's game-making potential, with some people using the Let's Play handouts as a reference and others pursuing their own challenges, such as implementing a version of Pac-Man. 4. Future events There are lots of ways to keep participating in ScratchEd professional development: Hang out on ScratchEd Come to the monthly meetups - Next month's meetup is a bit different, as it coincides with Scratch Day. Registration for Scratch Day MIT opens at the beginning of May. Attend the monthly webinars - The next webinar is all about computational practices and is taking place on Monday, April 25 at 7pm EST.

In the past few years, there has been a growing recognition of the importance of computational thinking for understanding and solving problems in a wide range of contexts, not only in the field of computer science. As young people program and share Scratch projects, they begin to develop as computational thinkers: they learn core computational and mathematical concepts, while also learning important strategies for designing, problem solving, and collaborating.

Here are some notes, reflections, and next steps... 0. Summary video of the meetup 1. Things we saw in Show & Tell Videos of the Show & Tell presentations are available online in the resources section and include: Nancy Costa shared animated Aesop's Fables that were created in her 3rd-5th grade Technology Class. Lou Lahana aka Techbrarian presented his curriculum for helping elementary and middle school students express social issues through Scratch projects and blogging. LeRhonda Greats showed us the first sprite she ever created and animated in Scratch. She talked about what was challenging about the project and how she used a clever costume technique to make her sprite dance. Susan Ettenheim and Francisco Cervantes presented Public Service Announcements (PSA) created by students in Susan's HS Animation course. Susan asked the group for suggestions on sharing student work and collaborating with other educators on her Scratch Cards project. David Wells presented his very first Scratch project, which he created at the NYC Meetup during a hands-on session. The project was based on the Interactive Collage activity, following an architecture theme. Donald Dagen, a volunteer educator for an after-school program, presented a 5th grade girl's Pacman project. 2. For the beginners We had about an hour of hands-on time with Scratch. The suggested activity was to create an interactive collage, but several different paths were explored including trying out the Scratch card activities and checking out the Scratch website. If this was your first experience with Scratch (or you want a refresher), here are some other resources that you might want to check out, to support your further explorations with Scratch. Getting started guide - How to make a first Scratch project. Design studio activities - 16 suggestions for design activities, such as making a project that includes the ""random"" block or making a project that has an orange square and purple circle. Creative computing workshop - This is a sequence of activities for getting started with Scratch. Any feedback on the sequence and activities would be appreciated. How could it be changed to be more useful? 3. Breakouts Mitch wrote a brief description of the breakout session he led around ""challenges"" (check out the activity and a demonstration video): In the breakout group, which had about 10 people, we divided time between hands-on ""challenges"" and discussion. The challenges were designed to explore different ways of adding interactivity to a Scratch project. For example, one challenge was: ""Whenever a sprite hears a sound, it changes color."" Everyone in the breakout created scripts in response to the challenge, then compared the different approaches used by different people. We discussed how the challenges could be used in the classroom -- and, more broadly, what types of activities are best for connecting with students' interests, while also helping them learn important computational ideas. Cameron wrote a brief description of the breakout session he led around ""computational thinking"": We had an engaging discussion of the various concepts and principles that comprise CT. To guide our discussion, I utilized the Big Ideas of Computational Thinking outlined by the Scratch Team.  To shape our discussion and examine CT from both a theoretical and applied perspective, we addressed the first two of three CT Big Ideas, concepts, and practices. In terms of CT concepts, we examined how Scratch provides useful concepts that are directly applicable to computer programming and that these blocks (such as loop, event, operator, and variable blocks) generate an accessible entry point for thinking about CT with Scratch. Next, we discussed the various CT practices. These four practices, incremental/iterative, testing/debugging, reusing/remixing, and abstracting/modularizing, are ideas that can be both applied to computer programming and core content areas within the primary and secondary school setting. A third breakout session focused on a discussion of video games. 4.

Boith classes had about twenty students in them. Of all those students a grand total of one was a female. What has happened? When I was in computer science in the 80's, It seemed to that  the mix was about sixty/forty. Some of the most brilliant technology people I have worked with over the last twenty some odd years have been women.

The Catroid project (Alpha) code.google.com/p/catroid/ is off to a good start, working on a number of Android handsets.  My own tests using a Nook Color didn't go too well, but directionally it's getting there.  Currently this is not port-able to the main Scratch site, but posting is on its own Catroid site (also Alpha). Within the last 24 hours, the talented community of programmers at XDA Developers have managed the incredible feat of developing a Ubuntu port to the Nook Color, sans tether (see   Initial attempts to get a Scratch Ubuntu DEB package to install failed.  Also, trying to play an existing Scratch .sb file using a browser plus the ScratchApplet.jar and soundbank.gm files did not work.  Undoubtedly as the development of Nookbuntu progresses and more functionality is built, we might finally have a ""portable"" Scratch that will be compatible with the main Scratch site.

Scratch programs are not only easy enough for her and her students to develop in, but they can be easily configured for each student’s needs. Now that I speak as the expert, I am in trouble, because I don't know what devices Scratch can either be developed on or just run on?

Also I am considering have the kids ""connect"" Scratch Projects together, where one project can broadcast and get/set variables in another project. The idea being kids could build a video game in Scratch, where other Scratch projects are the ""remote controls""  I may do this using Koji Yokokawa's ScratchConnect (as its good for kids to learn multiple languages and ways of doing things).  Is there anything I can do that is Scratch can broadcast and read/set ""sensor values"" from another Scratch project? Also any ideas or references to prior work in this area would be appreciated.

This workshop by Stephen Howell will provide the means by which anybody age 8 and up can develop their own interactive motion-capture games for the Kinect! Using Kinect2Scratch (a free bridging library developed by the presenter), the workshop will demonstrate 5-minute game creation with the free Scratch language, and provide methods for interfacing Kinect “skeleton” data (the users’ body joints) into Scratch programs. Many primary and secondary schools have no formal programming instruction at any level, and evangelizing computational thinking and logical problem-solving is a major challenge. Scratch, a free educational tool from MIT, addresses this by framing computer programming as a curiosity-driven, arts-oriented, creative activity — in a “building block” environment which students and teachers can learn very easily. More than 2 million programs, many of which are interactive games, have been written and shared by young people using the Scratch language. The Kinect depth sensor offers young programmers enticing possibilities for new forms of game design, but as C# and C++ are not languages in which they are likely to be skilled, kids can’t easily write code for the Kinect. Until now. With Scratch, a Kinect, and the bridging software provided in this workshop, a teacher can have a class writing motion-capture based games very quickly!

We have started a monthly Skype meeting to share ideas, successes, new agenda items, and build a common connection.   Everyone is invited to join. There is no pressure to actively participate you can just come and listen. This is Vicki Gold Computer Science teacher from Marshfield High school, and if any of you know me in the past I have had a very hard time introducing Scratch into my school.  I am happy to say this year, I have had some successes. This year we have a new Superintendent. He sends out weekly communications to the school district which includes a link of educational interest. I was able to include the scratch and scratched links to one week’s posting. In addition, there was an  mistake in the links, so Scratch was listed in two successive issues. I now have a physics teacher very interested making a Scratch Einstein game, and younger students wanting to create projects with children from other countries.  Later in the year the Special Education Department and I will apply for a grant to write an amazing app for android tablets. The application will be able to be customized by the students using app_inventor. I have a group of young talented programmers waiting in the background jumping for the chance to start. In my class I have been able to introduce the new Alice beta into my OO class. It is very good, and the students love 3D. Later in the year we will be using Scratch when we begin our Asteroid game. I know this is just a start of what the group envisions, but after five years of fighting I am very happy  with these small steps.

Les invito a presentarse en este foro y a utilizarlo como espacio de ""reunión virtual"" para que juntos sigamos imaginando, programando y compartiendo. Para empezar mi nombre es Oscar Pérez, soy educador de Costa Rica, país en el que utilizamos Scratch en las escuelas públicas en 4 de los niveles educativos, a saber tercero, cuarto, quinto y sexto grado (todos de primaria).  En estos niveles los estudiantes realizan diferentes productos programados que son orientados por guías didácticas.  Estas guias conducen el proceso a través del cual los estudiantes desarrollan sus programas en Scratch pero con un contenido temático de fondo, mismo que ha sido cuidadosamente seleccionado del plan de estudio para que esté alineado con el producto programado a desarrollar.  Con gusto les puedo compartir más de nuestra propuesta, pero primero espero a que ustedes también se presenten y nos cuenten un poco de la experiencia de sus países.

Here are some reflections and resources from Saturday's session... Attendees Courtney Collins Anesta Hicks Liddell Hobin Alan Landover Jared Perrine Simone Pyle ML UJWAL Susan Swan Summary We organized the 4-hour workshop around sessions #1 and #2 of the new Scratch curriculum guide. Each participant received a copy of the curriculum guide at the beginning of the workshop. After breakfast and introductions, Karen Brennan presented an overview of Scratch and Creative Computing, followed by the Something Surprising activity. Next, following session #2 of the curriculum guide, Michelle Chung introduced the ""About Me"" interactive collage activity centered around a Halloween theme. The group brainstormed project ideas about childhood memories of Halloween, and then, Michelle showed one way to get started by starting to build an example project on the large screen in front of the group. Next, everyone was given 40 minutes of uninterrupted hands-on time to explore their own ""Spooky Memories"" projects. We then held an impromptu Show & Tell session to check-in on everyone's progress and discuss the curriculum guide, followed by a second, 30-minute build session. The workshop ended with Karen sharing resources and strategies for next steps. Show & Tell During Show & Tell, each person shared their progress and talked about their process. We asked each participant: What are you most proud of? What was most challenging? or Is there something you're currently stuck on?

Como me pareció un material valioso, comencé con la traducción al español. Traduje hasta la página 20 (un poco más de la cuarta parte del documento) aunque en la página 14 falta traducir lo de las competencias que me parece que la gente de Eduteka puede ser de ayuda. Me pareció importante traducir la primer parte, sobre todo para tener un lenguaje en común y poder utilizar los mismos términos a lo largo de de todo el documento. Quedan por traducir 16 de las 20 sesiones que componen el documento. Adjunto aquí el enlace para que lo descarguen en formato DOC para que otros puedan completarlo. Sería ideal que coloquen en este mismo foro, como respuesta a este mensaje, su deseo de colaborar y el compromiso, por ejemplo: ""Me comprometo a traducir las sesiones 5 y 6"". De este modo sabremos qué tenemos que traducir cada uno y qué nos falta. A medida que vamos teniendo listas las traducciones las vamos subiendo a este espacio. ¿Qué les parece? Espero sus respuestas.

Also, how does Scratch respond to this issue? Without having an account the students will miss out on the ability to remix and request comments on their projects.

The application is available at http://wtp.mit.edu/application.html and the deadline is January 1, 2012. Their goal is to spark high school girls' interest in the future study of engineering and computer science. About the program Students attend WTP in either: Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) Mechanical Engineering (ME) WTP is designed for girls who have already demonstrated their ability to excel at math and science in their high school classes, but who have very little or no prior background in engineering or computer science. Female MIT graduate students design and teach the classes, assisted by female MIT undergraduate students who also live in the dorm with the high school girls. The daily required schedule includes classes, labs, homework, and social time with other WTP students. WTP classes do not earn academic credit from MIT; WTP students are expected to work hard because they are excited about learning. Sixty participants (40 for EECS and 20 for ME) are selected from a nationwide applicant pool of the top female 11 th grade math and science students. Students must reside in the U.S. (or be U.S. citizens if living outside the U.S. ). We are looking for students who are not yet certain about their future college majors, and who would like to explore engineering and computer science to determine whether these fields might be of interest. Who should apply Female students now in grade 11 who: love and excel at math and science, ?but have very little or no prior experience in engineering or computer science would like to experience hands-on activities where they design and build engineering projects enjoy problem solving and collaborative learning ? want to spend 4 summer weeks challenging their minds, working very hard in an intense academic environment, and making friends with girls from around the U.S. who share their math and science interests and motivation to excel.

Can I still assist and lead during LEGO We Do / Scratch activities? Well actually I am very knowledgeable in computing because that's my profession (IT Consultant). I am starting a project (XO olpc laptop, Lego We Do and Scratch) at a primary school and I am thinking in what extent should I give training to the teachers who will eventually take lead and give instructions in the classroom. My role is to provide and setup the technological environment. In the end teachers should be capable of setting up their own sessions and supporting students in the process.

I make my variables local by default, because I'm neurotic and like to limit the scope of things. But then, as I'm working, I realize I want to share the variable among my various sprites. The only thing I can do is delete the variable, and then make the variable again, but this time with the other scope. This is especially painful, because the old variable is still referenced in my scripts. I have to go and manually remove the old variable from my scripts and then replace it with the new variable of the same name."11172	Variables that have been deleted still show up in scripts as if they exist	11/29/11 20:47	"If I delete a variable then all uses of the variable should disappear from the script in which it is used or at least turn a funky colour to indicate deadness.

Recap After a speed dating networking activity, the group collectively developed the agenda for the day. We decided on two breakout sessions to discuss assessment and to share project ideas. Colin led the assessment group. First, he shared a work-in-progress evaluation plan which started a discussion around student's sharing projects as an assessment tool. Then Aaron and Colin role-played a student describing a project to a teacher with the rest of the group members sharing observations and ideas. Ricarose and Dan led another group across the room to share Scratch projects and lesson plan ideas. Over lunch, each of the breakout groups shared their experiences with the rest of the participants, followed by a lightning round Show & Tell. View photos from the event on the ScratchEd Flickr page.

Of course, I'm expecting bugs to pop up here and there -- if you notice anything, please don't hesitate to let me know. Bug reports are always welcome! Some aspects of the redesign that I'm particularly excited about: The redesign of the Resources section. In addition to refining the design of the search interface (now including searching by language!), we have three different pathways: new to Scratch, familiar with Scratch, and experienced with Scratch. If you have comments or suggestions for the pathways pages, I'd love to hear them. The addition of the Events section. Our events were formerly listed on a separate site, which made it hard to keep track of them. I'm hoping this integration will help people feel more connected to the face-to-face and real-time components of the ScratchEd community. The redesign of the Members section. You can now find people with similar interests (by age/grade level, curricular area, language) in addition to geographic proximity. To specify your interests, go to your profile (""My Profile"") at the top-right of the screen, then ""Edit"", then ""Member"". We'll be sending more information about the changes (in a video tutorial format) later this week. Thank you!

As part of the external evaluation team, I am interested in collecting some feedback and experiences from teachers who have used Scratch in the past with young children. At this phase in the research, I am hoping to speak to teachers who have used Scratch in a preschool - second grade classroom to find out what worked well with the program and what might need to be changed to create a more successful program for younger children. As a teacher myself, I understand how precious your time is. The ideal interview would be in the form of a phone interview which would last for about 20 minutes. If you are unable to speak on the phone, I would be more than happy to email you the questions for you to answer at your convenience. Interviews will typically be conducted in the afternoons and evenings, but ?I would be more than happy to fit with your schedule. ?I hope to complete these interviews by January 17, 2012.

These blocks make use of  music synthesizers built into the OS or Java. Unfortunately, for various reasons, Scratch 2.0 can't use those synthesizers, so we have to build our own synthesizer and musical instrument library. We've made a start. To hear the results so far, you can run musical projects  using the Flash-based player on the Scratch website. You'll probably notice that most of our instruments don't sound great. We want to improve both the number and quality of the instruments in Scratch 2.0, and we could use help. We're looking for links to free musical instrument files in SoundFont format (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_font) that we can incorporate into Scratch 2.0.

I have a simple script that looks like this in text: When space key pressed forever I press the space key and the script starts to execute --- it should execute forever. I have another script for the same Sprite that looks like this: When green flag clicked forever When I press the green flag icon the second script starts and the first script stops. Is this a bug, i.e., is pressing the green flag just supposed to start green flag scripts, or is it a feature, i.e., is pressing the green flag really supposed to stop all currently running scripts? - mulhern"11466	Stop Script block is never done	1/9/12 13:24	"So, I've got single-stepping mode enabled and it highlights the block it's on in a paleish sort of yellow.

Here's what happened... Attendees Here's a list of people who attended Saturday's meetup: Sandra Bleecker Janet Dee Ernest Dodson Kate Farb-Johnson Erika Gold Ingrid Gustafson Abby Howell Tom Kowalczyk Sarah Judd Jennifer Junkin Colin Meltzer Chris Mosier Prathima Rhodes Jean Sorensen Karen Brennan Michelle Chung Aaron Morris Ricarose Roque To connect with people you met, you can leave messages on people's profiles. Contact us if you need any help. Recap We started out with a speed networking activity to get to know each other's learning goals for 2012 and for the day's meetup. Then, the group brainstormed topics for breakout sessions. Colin led one breakout group around ""Struggling Scratchers."" The group developed strategies for encouraging persistance when students get stuck. Ernest spearheaded another group about ""Speed Scratching"" to think of how to best deal with the issue of lacking sufficient time when teaching Scratch in a classroom setting. Sandra and Janet led a discussion about how to approach administration to garner support for Scratch programs. Karen met with participants who were interested proposal submission ideas for the upcoming Scratch@MIT conference. The deadline is February 15. Over lunch, members from each breakout groups shared summaries with the rest of the participants, followed by a lightning round Show & Tell. View photos from the event on Flickr. Show & Tell Jenny and Colin shared an assessment worksheet that they have been collaborating on to evaluate students' learning of math concepts using Scratch. Ingrid demoed some interactive name projects created by her first and second graders. Ingrid explained how she took advantage of the voice recording feature in Scratch to capture student interviews about their work. Ernest shared Scratch projects from his summer camp students. Ricarose introduced Collab Camp, a virtual event on the Scratch website that invites Scratchers to create Scratch projects in teams. Colin talked about a new resource he developed - a set of Scratch challenges that scaffold students learning of the basic concepts of Scratch and programming in a fun way.

Summary We organized the 4-hour workshop around sessions #1 and #2 of the new Scratch curriculum guide. Upon arrival, each participant received a Scratch Starter Kit, which included a copy of the curriculum guide, Scratch Cards, and other fun Scratch resources to help them get started. Over lunch, Karen presented an overview of Scratch and showed the range of possibilities through a variety of Scratch projects. This was followed by the Something Surprising activity (session #1 in the guide) facilitated by Karen and Ricarose. What followed was an explosion of creativity as participants were given an hour and a half of hands-on building time to explore and develop their own Scratch projects. The creations ranged from interactive collages and stories to games and simulations. Afterwards, we held a gallery walk and impromptu Show & Tell session for participants to share their work with one another. Then the workshop ended with Karen guiding reflection and group discussion.

After a speed networking activity and a huge WELCOME BACK from Karen and Mitch, the group launched into morning breakout sessions. Four groups emerged: Intro to Scratch - During this session, led by Mitch, those who were new to Scratch or wanted a refresher course were able to gain hands-on experience building interactive collage in Scratch. Rubric Review - A group of educators from Suffern, NY are developing an assessment to accompany the Scratch curriculum guide draft and they organized this session to receive feedback on their rubric. Scratch/CS/Java Course Connections - Frank and Stacy led this session to discuss how to make connections between the learning that their students are experiencing with Scratch and Java programming. Scratch Activity Design - Ron, Michelle, and several other educators took this time to brainstorm activities and challenges that might help engage students who are stuck or are struggling to make personal connections with Scratch. After lunch, we had the pleasure of hearing a wide variety of presentations during Show & Tell: Frank discussed strategies for engaging both boys and girls in his class and shared some of the types of projects they created. Jennifer talked about how she uses the Scratch website during class with her 8th graders. Eleanor started a discussion around creating electronic design journals. Claire shared projects that were designed by her fourth graders while learning about lists and variables. Ron shared his experiences working to engage students about the coordinate graph using Scratch. Anne Marie presented games created by 7th and 8th graders during an enrichment course. Ernest shared a sample Scratch project that one of his students created during summer camp. David presented an assessment rubric that he and his colleagues are currently developing to complement their Scratch curriculum unit. Debbie showed a project she developed that creates melodies in Scratch. Julianne presented a draft project and requested feedback on behalf of one of her 5th grade students. Ryan presented student projects that were designed to use lists. Lorraine shared projects made by her K-6 students that illustrate creating, communicating, and collaborating with Scratch. After Show & Tell, we held two more breakout sessions, each lasting 30-minutes. During the first 30-minute period, sessions offered included: EDC/MIT Instrument Design - In this session, Francisco and Karen presented an assessment tool currently in development to evaluate the types of computational thinking skills that students develop while working with Scratch. Intro to Curriculum Guide - Aaron and Michelle invited educators to learn more about the Scratch Curriculum Guide draft and share their experiences from using the guide. The second set of breakout sessions covered: Scratch Website - Jennifer led a group discussion around what challenges and opportunities might arise from integrating the Scratch website as part of the curriculum. Connecting the Physical World - Mitch presented different tools that help make connections between Scratch and the physical world such as the LEGO WeDo Robotics Kit, PicoBoard, and Xbox Kinect. Resources Each participant received a Scratch Starter Kit which includes a copy of the Scratch curriculum guide, Scratch Cards, Scratch Cat stickers, a Scratch pin and other resources.

Here's some notes and reflections... Attendees Here's a list of people who attended Saturday's meetup: Sandra Bleecker Nancy Cooperider Janet Dee Sarah Judd Tom Kowalczyk Rosemary Slattery Jean Sorensen Karen Brennan Michelle Chung To connect with people you met, click on a name above to leave a message on their profile page. Recap Networking: Red, Yellow, Green - As they arrived, participants were given three cards, one red, one yellow and one green. Reflecting on the past month, each person was asked to share something from their teaching experience that was great (green), okay (yellow), and not so great (red). Breakout Session: Costumes and Drawing - Janet and Sandie led the whole group in a session exploring costumes. They demonstrated how to create a pencil in the paint editor and animate the pencil using the pen tool to simulate drawing a line. Then, with a suggestion from Karen, the group was challenged to explore different ways to use the change costume block to make the pencil tip look like it was wearing down while it drew the line. Photos on Flickr - View photos from the event on ScratchEd's Flickr page. Show & Tell Pencil Challenge - Sandie and Janet shared their solution to the morning session's pencil challenge. Scratch Rubric - Rosemary shared a rubric for Scratch projects that she uses with her high school students. Example Projects Gallery - Jean showed example projects she has been collecting as her favorites on the Scratch website to use when introducing Scratch. You can check out the projects on her Scratch profile page.

I am a computer science faculty member, so I am used to teaching undergrads. I have a little experience with Scratch, mainly from helping my 11 year old son who uses it. I also am teaching AppInventor this semester to undergrads who have never programmed before - AppInventor has a lot of similarities to Scratch.  I would like to do this  because our school district is badly lacking in computer science content at any level. However, I am also seriously time-slammed so I am hesitating about taking this on. So my questions are First, is this even realistic? Our school district is good, and the kids are sharp, but will they be able to do anything at all in Scratch given the constrained nature of the program? And, if I take this on, I only have 3 weeks to prepare, with little spare time due to my regular teaching and research commitments - are there resources out there aimed at this age group? I don't have any experience teaching kids except for working with my own. I know I would need appropriate projects and materials in order to do this since I don't have the expertise or time to develop anything. Is this a really Bad Idea, or is it a Good Idea to take this on? thanks, Bonnie MacKellar"11808	Compiling Individual Scratch Programs into a Single File	2/7/12 8:40	Hi!

I am researching Games-based learning through the use of game making in class for my PhD.   At present I work with classes of children Primary 4 to primary 7 (ages 8-12).  I work for around 8 hours with them over  8 weeks to develop a game, however while not part of what im trying to research I would like to know if anyone has assessed any game making with their class.  What I'm looking to see is has anyone developed any methods of assessing what the children have made for their game i.e does it have sprites, backgrounds, scripts.  Or even if anyone could offer advice it would be a help as this would posibly help strengthen the research already being done."11844	Rubric for the Curriculum Guide	2/10/12 10:56	"A number of us at Ramapo Central School District in Suffern, NY are implemening the Curriculum Guide as the backbone of our new third grade Computational Thinking unit. We brought a draft of the rubric up to the Scratch meetup a few weeks ago, and garnered some excellent feedback. We've now revised it enough to share with the ScratchEd community. We intend the rubric to be used as a tool for both students and teachers to evaluate the major projects in the unit: Dance party, Storytelling, Art, Games, and a final project. You'll also notice that there are notes in the document, intended for teachers' eyes. We want to know what you think! What do you like? How would you change it for use in your own classrooms? Your feedback would be much appreciated.

I am teaching Scratch to secondary education students (3rd grade junior high school) and I have to admit every single student loves it! As far as I know I am the only one teaching Scratch at school in my region. I would very much like to have the opportunity and the means to further promote both the Scratch spirit and its community. So I was wondering if there is any chance of a local event (or in Greece, in general) preferably in the Greek language. I also think it would be a great idea if I could give promotion goods to the students such as Scratch t-shirts and the like. Is such type of support / promotion available?

I, being a Scratch fanatic, was given the task of creating a very short, introductory lesson that is going to last about 1.5 hours, and use Scratch. I started to work on it but I also would like to hear from the experienced educators. The groups will probably consist of 9-10 children, ages between 10-13, and almost no exposure to programming beforehand. And we'll have 1.5 hours to introduce Scratch. (During the same day, they will visit other sessions / tracks such as robotics programming (with Dwengo robot), Lego Mindstorms, etc.) All tips (including pitfalls, things to avoid, etc) are welcome.

Recap Networking: Speed Dating - The meetup started with a speed networking activity. To facilitate the conversation, we asked participants to share with their partner one thing that they hoped to learn or figure out at the meetup. Breakout Sessions: Discussions - During a quick brainstorming session, the group collectively decided on four breakout sessions. Three were discussions led by different attendees: strategies for getting students started with Scratch led by Caitlin, implementation and teaching strategies for Scratch educators facilitated by Aaron, and advanced topics with Ingrid Breakout Session: Hands-On with Scratch - The fourth breakout session was a hands-on design challenge around variables with Karen and Mylo. Participants were challenged to design a Scratch project where a character moved around and collected items on the screen to increase the score. Individuals were first given time to tackle the challenge on their own or in pairs, and then the group discussed and shared different approaches used. For example, check out John's final project and here's another example from Vanessa, Mylo, and Jesse. Photos on Flickr - View photos from the event on the ScratchEd Flickr page. Show & Tell Scratch Online Course - John described an introductory Scratch Moodle course that he and Larry are offering to educators. About Me Student Projects - Carmen presented About Me project drafts created by two of her students. Pencil Sharpener Project - Jesse shared  his pencil sharpener project that was inspired from the March meetup's pencil challenge breakout session.

I focus on using the parts of the language that can be leveraged to do neat things simply. Therefore, dynamic cloning and deletion is attractive. At some point, I showed how you can do just a bit more with dynamic cloning and deletion by using a variable. In particular, I used examples where sprites are dynamically cloned but the variable they all share is updated in some way, so each of the clones can have distinct behaviors based on one, or at most two, variables. I have two questions: 1) Why is sending messages so verbose when it is so fundamental in Smalltalk and that fundamentalness should carry over to BYOB ? Btw, I have just said about all I know of Smalltalk in the last sentence so I may be confused. Would it make more sense to have a dedicated message sending block instead of overloading the ""of"" block in such a way? 2) Why does the ""of"" block have to be in a launch block instead of a report block? launch (the script (set age to 3)) of (clone) results in a clone with its age set correctly to 3. However, report (the script (set age to 3)) of (clone) results in a clone that still shares its age with its parent. I think this is a question about semantics. I'm familiar with all sorts of PL semantics, but I'm pretty confused about BYOB semantics. Thanks for your help. - mulhern"12459	Custom Block Types	4/17/12 5:39	"I'm really excited about custom blocks in Scratch 2.0! My question is: what types of custom blocks will there be? In the Scratch 2.0 preview, a ""jump"" custom block was presented which is a stack block. Will there also be custom reporters such as in BYOB? Thanks in advance for any answer!

Most of the Scratch Team's time and effort is spent thinking carefully about how to make Scratch 2.0 easy and intuitive for people who are new to programming. Developers help turn those ideas into working code. The movie below is a visualization that shows how one part of Scratch 2.0 - the website code - has grown and changed as we work on it. Each dot represents a file that's part of Scratch 2.0. The figures that dart in and out, making changes to existing files and adding new ones, are the developers. As you'll see, Champika Fernando, the lead developer of the Scratch 2.0 website, has changed a lot of files, along with John Maloney and Sayamindu Dasgupta. And of course, the entire Scratch Team has been thinking carefully about the design of things (something which this visualization does not show). Lots of Scratchers have been asking us when Scratch 2.0 will be ready. It's still too soon to name an exact date, but we're planning to launch Scratch 2.0 later this year. As soon as we have a timetable for release, we’ll post an announcement."12583	ScratchEd Weekly Roundup | 04/21/12 - 04/27/12	4/28/12 23:22	"The weekly roundup is where the ScratchEd Team shares some of the major -- as well as some of the overlooked -- news, stories, and events related to Scratch that took place throughout the week.

As the students (high school) are getting better with Scratch, their programming problems are getting more complex but not the creativity of the projects. The class is becoming fragmented as fewer and fewer can help with the programming problems. Those who are natural programmers are getting impatient when they are not able to solve more advanced problems and those who are not, finding the problems too complex to follow, are dropping out of what was a very collaborative environment earlier!

I work for the Computer Science Student Network (www.cs2n.org) and I am preparing to host our first game competition for scratchers of all ages.  The way our competitions work is we provide a theme and deadline for students, they upload their game (or a link to their game) and once the contest is over, the students then evaluate each others' work.  Our evaluation process is detailed here if you'd like to learn more. The following are the rubrics we plan to use.  As experienced teachers/users of Scratch, do you see any potential problems with these rubrics? A. Theme (Does the game match the theme?) 5: The game matches the theme. 3: The game partly matches the theme. 1: The game does not align with the theme. B. Story (Does the story cohere with the game?) 5: The story and game complement each other. 3: The story and game do not complement each other. 1: There is no story. C. Aesthetics (Do the setting, colors, and lighting cohere with the game?) 5: The aesthetics are used to complement the feel of the game. 3: The aesthetics and game do not complement each other 1: The aesthetics take away from the game. D. Mechanics (How well are events sequenced?) 5: Game play is smooth and events trigger with little or no trouble. 3: Game play is mostly smooth; some events trigger with poor response time. 1: Game play isn’t smooth and events trigger with poor response time. E. Player Instruction (How well does the game direct the player?) 5: The goal and rules of the game are easy to learn. 3: The goal and rules of the game are mostly easy to learn. 1: The goal and rules of the game are not easy to learn. F. Overall Experience (Is this a fun game?) 5: I would like to play this game again. 3: After some changes, I would play this game again. 1: I would not like to play this game again."12736	Debugging	5/15/12 7:23	"We just did the debugging exercises yesterday and today we are starting the gaming part of the new curriculum.

Has anyone ever run a competition with Scratch?  If so, what pitfalls should we avoid?  Even if you haven't, what ideas do you think we could include?  Thanks!"12848	"Reflections on NYC Scratch Educator Meetup: Wednesday, May 23, 2012"	5/24/12 11:46	"Thanks to everyone who joined us for the May 2012 NYC Scratch Educator Meetup!

Does anyone have any ""definitely avoid!"" or ""must-do"" suggestions??   Once we get through this, I'm sure we'll be better able to plan additional Scratch classes.   BUT,  I'd really like to avoid flat out novice disaster the first time through!    What could go wrong that I should be thinking about and planning for now? The class is free, but students must sign up -- hopefully that will get us kids who are already interested.  We're allowing 90 minutes per session, followed by a free lunch. Any thoughts on what % of kids who give Scratch a try find that they like it?  What about learning styles/types of students for whom Scratch works especially well, or doesn't seem to be a match?

I wonder if any of you have seen the MagPi magazine - it had an article on Scratch (not by me) in thefirst issue. I am planning to write something for the next issue. You can have a look at what I have so far here. (pdf). It's very simple stuff. I am hoping to do more as I learn how to use Scratch more. I'm probably going to focus on learning fairly traditional programming skills (as in the examples in the article) rather than making games and animations. I'll have to see what the editorial team on the MagPi think!

Reason #1: Awesome third keynote I'm thrilled to announce a great third keynote on Saturday morning from 9:30-10:30am, featuring 5 third-graders and their teachers, discussing their experiences of a district-wide Scratch initiative. Reason #2: Scratcher Show & Tell Just added to the program on Saturday at 11:00am, we'll have a session featuring young Scratchers sharing their projects in a Show & Tell format. Reason #3: Fantastic sessions In addition to the Show & Tell session, we have fantastic concurrent sessions, including: two presentations about computational thinking, an international and collaborative hands-on Scratch workshop, and a panel about collaboration in the Scratch online community."13278	Immutable values	7/3/12 13:53	"I'd like to see immutable values in Scratch so we could define Pi for example.

For the design notebook, since the students won't be ""keeping"" their weekly design reflections unless they keep them in a text document of their own and just paste them into the course software (which I will suggest) but still, I'm wondering if it might not be better to have one class blog that is the class Design Notebook and every session, post the design question and have everyone reply to that one post - otherwise it will be only myself and the student who sees the online journal entry which feels like a waste. Thoughts?"13314	"Teaching concepts and philosophies, lesson plans, Tinkering, and Scratch"	7/6/12 12:06	"Hi all. I joined Scratch Ed long ago and quickly left and never came back. Instead, I began teaching Scratch users nightly in the All About Scratch forum (which has since changed titles) by helping them with their projects. My biggest concern was that here at Scratc Ed, there seemed to be a lot of education terminology and normal school philosophy thrown about but it seemed like very few people actually understood Scratch programing. I hope this has changed! Please understand, I am not trivializing the hard work and good intentions of so many people. I just think that if you are going to teach it, you need to understand it and that takes more effort than organizing a lesson plan and maintaining order in a classroom. I have almost a lifetime of association with education in many forms and the inflexibility often forced in a classroom environment is a terrible thing and a crutch for those who don't have an acceptable level of competency. The reason I am making this post is because I was contacted and asked to provide a lesson plan for a week long PicoBlocks class as I have taught a similar class before. PicoBlocks is a version of Scratch designed to interface Scratch programing with motorized Legos like the WeDo system. It utilizes a sensor board and is a lot of fun, which is critical to my way of teaching. Below is my emailed response, provided for you as a glimpse into a successful realization of implementing Scratch/PicoCrickets into a classroom along with some contemporary approaches to learning. I hope it inspires more of the same :) ___________________________________________________________________________________ (My old Scratch Ed post..) I  teach classes at a local museum using PicoBlocks along with the WeDo. PicoBlocks is a version of Scratch written specifically to interface the WeDo system along with the PicoCricket system. I have done both single day/ 3 hour classes and week long/ 4hour per day classes. So I have not established any set curriculum, especially that would apply to a long term class session however I would be happy to provide any help if desired. zac_ray@fastmail.fm I also have a Scratch projects gallery, some of which I have used in my classroom here. (http://scratch.mit.edu/users/Locomule) (the emailed request I recently received..) I was wondering if you have since written a plan/outline of something you use in a week long camp??? (and my reply, the point of this rambling, sorry..) I haven't created a lesson plan but would be glad to help if possible. Not knowing a potential instructors competency level with PicoBlocks-type programing is the biggest obstacle that I foresee. Otherwise, I would need to know classroom details.. exact # of class days and how many hours per day approximate # of students and ages # of instructors # of computers running PicoBlocks in the classroom what WeDo or Lego sets are going to be used Otherwise, I could provide some general concepts to be taken into consideration based on my experiences.. You cannot teach kids to program in a week so don't plan on it, especially when combining programing with Legos. But that is OK :) and all the more reason an instructor needs to be fluent in Pico programing. Classroom time will be limited so you must be able to teach and write and debug simple programs with confidence. Most kids will not want to learn the programing either, not once they see each other building Lego projects. I had the benefit of being allowed to teach my way, and I am not a big fan of typical lesson plans. I use them as guides, not hard and fast maps but then again, I am also an entertainer so I am fast on my feet. I prefer to be dynamic and respond to the changing needs of my classroom on the fly. I print out more activities, plans, etc than I need and divide them into 1) Gotta do cool stuff and 2) Kinda cool stuff. Likewise, I separate these into groups based on how much time they take up. This allows me to make sure that the best information gets experienced while throwing in quick lessons in moments of extra time. If I run out of time, I know that I am leaving out my least favored stuff. I'll touch on something at the end of this message called Tinkering and how it fits into my teaching style and PicoBlocks. I first spent showed off some Scratch games and stuff of my own, with a brief demonstration of how Pico blocks get put together in a program. (Scratch is the program that PicoBlocks is derived from and is almost the same thing) Our PicoCrickets came with cards that had various project ideas. My students picked some out and made musical Play-doh, a door alarm for our classroom, light sensors that set off multi-colored lights and various sounds such as cats meowing, horns, etc through a speaker. We did many other projects as well. We spent most of one day building projects that came with each WeDo kit. Some built moving sculptures, others built motorized windmills, etc. Between classes, I used a couple of kits to make a motorized car with headlights that you could steer. I told them that we would do something similar on the last day. But by then I realized that we could not, as a class, build individual Pico-driven cars and had too many students to build a single car. Instead, we made a drag race track for them to race simple, custom-made, non-Pico Lego cars on, complete with a Pico driven drag strip with a start/finish timing system with a red/yellow/green start light tree that lit up with slightly randomized light intervals. The students loved making the cars and then re-working them to improve their designs between races to make them faster. We made a big scoreboard on cardboard. It has been a while since I did this so I have forgotten many things, I'm sure. Since I did taught PicoCrickets, I have become very good at Scratch programing. I have also been sent to the Exploratorium Museum in San Francisco and learned about Tinkering. Tinkering is the evolution of education as facilitated in a museum environment. Sounds like a mouthful but it is really cool. The concept is based on the idea that we all learn in different ways so why force someone to use method A and ignore method B? For example, one Tinkering project I participated in involved our group walking into a space that had 3 tables filled with odds and ends... spools, wires, batteries, small 1.5v dc motors, glue guns, masking tape, tongue depressors, plastic cups, etc. Simple craft supplies. We were given minimal instruction, other than being shown how to hook batteries up to motors and how to use glue sticks to make an offset weight to attach to the motor. Our goal was to make simple bots that moved around. Afterwards, we discussed our individual methodologies. Some people looked at the supplies and thought, ""Hmmm, what could I make out of that?"" Others came up with a mental image of their bot and then sought materials to make it with. That is exactly the point, we all still learned but in ways that made sense to the individual learner. Tinkering is a way to provide open-ended solutions to a problem so that your audience can solve it their own way. In essence, they teach themselves. Your job as a facilitator is to answer questions, give simple examples, and occasionally inspire more thinking by saying ""What if you...?"" The reason I mention Tinkering is because my teaching style runs very parallel to Tinkering philosophy. That is why to others, my ""lesson plans"" probably look rather vague. There is no ""9:00 am do this 10:30 do that"" etc. Unless you repeat the same courses for many years, you won't know exactly how long things will take or how popular they will be with your students. My #1 rule in my classroom is that we have fun, and do we ever. Once the kids are having fun, they become inquisitive and begin teaching themselves and each other. You move from instructor to facilitator, but you have to be keenly aware of what is going on and quick to recognize when to jump in, jump out, or just observe. For example, one of the first questions once we started Lego drag racing was ""Why does my car keep losing?"" I (deliberately) said ""Friction"" and turned around as if to walk off. ""What is that?"" was the cry from me behind me so I turned back and said ""Ok, take one shoe off and leave the other on. Now slide the socked foot, then try to slide the other foot with the shoe still on it. The reason the shoed foot won't slide is easy IS friction!"" Then we got into how axles must rub against other parts of the car creating friction, how different wheels had varying properties of friction and smoothness of circular motion. Friction was good for winning on our race course, but what about stopping a real car? Now you need friction, big-time! In essence, we were Tinkering. It was a great experience. I'm sorry this message is so long but I didn't know how else to explain a Zac Ray lesson plan, heh. I judge my success on a few simple factors. I taught at a museum during the summer. Parents who often were just looking for baby-sitting with an edge called back wanting to sign their kids up for ""whatever classes Mr. Zac is teaching."" When it was time for lunch or to go home, students had to be forced out of their chairs. Take me out of the equation because I am the least important factor and imagine a classroom where kids have fun learning and don't want to stop. It is a beautiful thing! Seeing this happen in a public school setting is a dream of mine. Time after time, I saw public school teachers come in to teach other classes with that antiquated ""I'm gonna turn the lights on and off until you all settle down"" mentality and the kids suffered for it. Learning became a drag, and who wants to be involved in that? No one, even if you force them to do it anyway.

The congenial atmosphere that surrounds the conference does not just happen.  We are together because we share a vision of learning and sharing that fosters big dreams in each of us. Each time I enter the Media Lab, my thoughts return to a night in the early 80s.  I was working on a Masters Degree at the University of Massachusetts in Amherst, focusing on instructional applications of computers. One of my professors, Claus Schultz, drove a group of us to MIT to hear Seymour Papert speak.  We arrived a little late; the room was filled to capacity. (Mitch, I think I remember you being there, working with him in a way that reminds me of the way I see you and Karen working together.)

If have tried the first three and uploaded EXE versions of my solutions ..... https://www.dropbox.com/sh/fbrnqg60qytz2sz/COgBWlPRCn Problem 1: Multiplication `a la russe The standard multiplication algorithm taught in elementary schools represents just one of several ways to compute the product of two numbers. A different method, which was known in ancient Egypt and is called multiplication `a la russe, more closely resembles how multiplication is performed in electronic computers. Using this method, we need not refer to (or memorize) the standard multiplication table (which, for any two single-digit numbers, tells us their product). Rather, we need to know how to do four things: add, decrement, double, and halve. Using these four operations, we can characterize multiplication of two positive integers a and b as follows: Develop a program that, given two positive integers, multiplies them according to this method and outputs their product as the sum of numbers obtained during the process. For the example above, this sum is 6 + 12 + 48 + 192 + 384. Input: The first line contains a positive integer n indicating how many instances of the problem are described thereafter. Each of the next n lines contains a pair of positive integers a and b to be multiplied, separated by a space.

(Formerly Integrating Scratch in Curriculum and the Arts)	8/11/12 11:29	"Integrating Scratch into the Curriculum and the Arts Michelle Chung, Andrea Ange, Debbie Corleto, Frank Abbot, Karen Eutemey, Barbara Sanchez. k-20 representation at the table. Andrea Ange- How to use Scratch outside of the CS curriculum? Debbie Corleto- Create their own live animated comic book for middle school art. AA- How to get other teachers on board? Karen Eutemey- Knowing what other teachers are doing is very helpful. Frank Abbot- There are the physical hurdles: computers for teachers, time for personal development before implementation in class, feeling like they are ready and giving them technical support while they use the tool. DC- Computer and art people are most likely to use this first. Barbara Sanchez- I teach French and computer science, so I created a model of famous monument in Paris. Have them do a little walking tour… they will have to do some linear stepping through backgrounds… KE- Likes to work with groups of kids and have them work with projects that they are working in conjunction with… then the group has the final say would be whichever child might be responsible for each component. BS- Advisor for the 21st Century Literacy class which is funny because there are a million definitions for this out there. Who’s to say what that literacy should include? But I can see using this in class. FA- In the lab they have online lessons. Scratch might be an alternative assignment instead of a PowerPoint, they can use scratch to be the presentation format…You can verify that with the CS teacher, there must be at least one computer for every two kids…. KE We have a lab and carts with laptops you can sign up to be in the lab, or you can sign out a laptop. DC – Nothing worked last year but now getting them on it and I do want to collaborate just because I’m new to it I’m going to have to go through the curriculum to get people into it. FA I have mixed feelings about the projects, but they will get caught up in the minutia of the programming part. KE They’re computer teacher starts working with them in fourth grade in scratch. DC Do I do it with all of them so they are all working on it all three years? BS- You mean you get them for all three years? That’s great! Michelle Chung- What if you did a combo pack? What if you took the tour of the museum, and what if you expanded that into creating a tour of different areas in small groups? If they are working in groups or pairs… Different pieces can be dropped into a combined program. AA- Because there is the import function MC- You can do what Lorraine is doing which is very macro with her world museum. BS- I introduce it by giving my students one card a week for the kids that want to go faster since I have taught High School Computer Science I could get into other stuff. AA-Some of the ideas I am hearing are cartooning, creating video type works, mapping areas, creating games and really first we have to find teachers that are interested and either do a formal workshop or reach out to the project based learners in your schools and work with them… BC- Bring them in and work in collaboration. KE- the foreign language teachers can use this as an assessment tool... the kids get five points for the getting the response correct and the recording option is also very neat… MC- You can actually change the language of Scratch. Click on the globe and change it to the language you are teaching… FA- Do you collect data on who is still using it from the workshops? MC- Not formal but what we have been seeing is a lot of people continue to use the website and forums for discussion. We break but I’m sure that more ideas are out there for integrating this into the whole school. Please post your ideas in response to our discussion!"13751	Integrating Scratch with CS roundtable	8/11/12 12:10	"cs teachers what you do in 9 weeks? (1-hour meeting) how scratch can relate to upper cs concepts can scratch lead to oop concepts -- e.g. methods/public /private through calls (broadcasts), especially if you encourage kids to use single-stepping to watch how things are going provide them with challenges to think as computer scientists keep things closed at the beginning, then let the kids go creating their own projects a look on how universities are using scratch (Berkeley/Snap) scratch vs. other choices (e.g. greenfoot, alice, app inventor) kids were more excited to play with app inventor (not about alice): lots of possibilities. scratch can be used with other subject matters: geometry, algebra, physics, history... but scratch cannot be used directly for the ap exam, although it will help computational thinking. the ability to share is more motivating kids .. they‘d like the idea of other viewing their projects proving sth personalized would help kids collaborate appropriately sharing concerns: accounts for the class with no need for parents permission privacy concerns! Thanks to Abdulrahman for taking the notes in a very free flowing discussion."13753	"Scratch V2.0 Breakout Session - August 11, 2012 with Mitch Resnick"	8/11/12 14:03	"Scratch V2.0 Breakout Session - August 11, 2012 with Mitch Resnick The focus of Scratch v2.0 is to put it on the Web. Future considerations for a Tablet?  It currently works on the Android but is not good Next big design effort is to have Scratch work on tablets. Add a Scrolling background - multiple requests v1.4: Currently Scratch works locally on my PC and projects can be uploaded to the Scratch website but I cannot modify a website project’s code dynamically. v2.0:  There is a new “See code” button and a Backpack area See code: Displays code: displays a website project sprite and the code for it’s blocks (methods) in a script area Modify code:  Allow me to dynamically change the the sprite’s code and test it. Backpack Save blocks:  drag the sprite or the code blocks to my backpack area Use blocks: drag the new sprite or code blocks into my project to use Sprite (Object) Custom Blocks (Methods with parameters): Sprites can now create reusable code blocks that can be shared among sprites.  For example a Jump block Make Block : creates a custom block or method that is reuseable Click on Make Block - creates a new Brown custom block Name it Jump Up 10 wait 1 second Down 10 wait 1 second Can drag and drop it Parameter:  To add parameters, Right click on top bar of block New brown Jump block can be dragged to the script area. Share Block between sprites Drag the new Brown Jump block into the backpack click on new sprite drag up to the new sprite’s script section Camera Interface - Video Motion blocks Using the PC camera, the video is full screen covering the entire stage Local motion: Sprite can act up the info and use it to make decisions.  Ex: a balloon senses a hand waving motion and moves to the left or right or “pops”. Global motion - balloon reacts to the general global motion of a person swaying back and forth across the entire screen Cloning Create a clone of a sprite ( Instance) - create a copy of a sprite on the screen (eg. fireworks explode at the same x and y position where you click on a screen or a cat plants a tree and moves 10 steps forward. Clone is created and positioned at the same x and y position  on the stage based on the center of the calling sprite’s or the mouse. Example:  A Cat plants trees that grow and move 10 steps Cat block - Plant a tree repeat create clone of tree move 50 steps wait Tree Clone command: Grow a tree Clone startup block set size to 10% repeat 90 change size by 1 wait 0.1 seconds Create multiple instance of the Tree object on the stage Paint Editor for Vector Graphics - This is difficult to make it “easy to use” and it is currently buggy manipulates vector and bitmap graphics create objects Layers: objects are on separate layers move objects with arrow pointer import vector and bitmap graphics Cloud Variables write and remember a global variable on a website, which can be used for a group survey or the highest score Every user who visits the site is given and anonymous ID number and the system keeps track of who visits the site so you can limit everyone to vote only once.  The ID number was implemented for privacy issues. Note: Scratch website is an open environment and doesn’t allow “private groups” to avoid “unacceptable behavior” so private groups are not allowed. Teachers can create a Class Gallery so their students can post it a common area. Teacher create a Teacher account create a Class Gallery, where only the students can post to it automatically notifies when there is a new post in the Gallery can delete a student project but cannot modify a student project Students create a student  account post their projects write comments Anyone can READ the comments and VIEW the projects"13757	Notes from Final Reflections	8/11/12 18:34	"Brief notes from our ""circle share."" -encourages inclusion -links to art-we can totally use art, design, on compupters -took us from where we were and moved us forward -the tour of the media lab-hi-lo tech gave us a broad scope for our kids' futures -Scratch on the Web-got to see ""under the hood."" Something for everyone. MIT provides the vehicle but we make it come alive. Learning is social-these workshops are so important for learning! Teacher Development idea: have teachers and students work together to learn Scratch. Both come away with different concepts and knowledge and can help each other. Social Studies idea: have Washington crossing the Delaware. ""Blended Deliveries""-tech and teaching. Adults shut down...""I don't do tech."" But, Scratch is easy and fun! Tools-harpsichord, pens.... Scratch is not a resource hog, so nice to use in labs. Since PPT is becoming passe, Scratch might be a viable presentation tool. Walking into a painting... The Creative Process Some kids are not grade-motivated. We still need to tap into their interests. Need tools and framework in which to work. Freedom without anarchy! Advisory: put the kids and teachers in learning teams. Intrinsic motivation. Do activity with teachers first and then with kids if nervous! Teachers don't know everything! Let kids know that! Tech teacher teaches all teachers how to use Scratch, then let kids work and learn and use computers in all curricula areas! Teach mini-lessons and as other kids see others working on Scratch they might ""catch"" it! 2.0 Logo maybe make one that appeals to older kids? -You don't screw around with Coke Classic!- mres: might set up ways to choose a default character for classes Looking into other image libraries, says that the characters do appeal to younger kids. Would love posters Would love  more time in Media Lab-insanely amazing place! Wide variety of people here, some needed prerequisites, prep for newbies. Would love a path to suggestions as to what to learn/do first, then next...What resources do I begin with? Identify this at the beginning. Work on Scratch cards in order. No one path for everyone but doesn't mean we shouldn't have a path for anyone! Want next set of cards! :) Can't export Scratch projects. Could use Jing or other similar software.

It is easier to see what others did. ·      NEW- MAKE YOUR OWN BLOCKS ( BROWN COLOR)-Go to Blocks>More Blocks>Name it>Define it> possibly with a script from the backpack. You could name a JUMP block. ·      You can control how high something JUMPSi n “EDIT BLOCK”, “JUMP HEIGHT” , change “y” by -1 = height jumped ·      Making own blocks- keep in separate category the color for MORE BLOCKS is BROWN. ·      Put blocks in backpack to save-otherwise it is just for that project Interactive ·      Using the laptop camera use yourself as the stage to move the balloons around. Makes you an interactive part of the game New Blocks in 2.0  Blue Block has Video “Motion” on  “this sprite” Under sprites there are icons for  person,brush,file or camera This is a new way to think of sensing and conditionals Cloning (example FIREWORKS) Same sprite is clones and each one does its own thing Example Cat planting Palm Trees It starts small and grows Clone start up set size to 10% and keep repeating Change size by -1 each time the tree is cloned it should start out small and growCloning starts wherever the sprite is.

One group volunteered their debug it challenge entitled ""Spiral"" for the rest of the participants to solve as a group. The challenge was: The student wanted to create a program where a pencil is drawing a spiraling square, but the pencil is only drawing a square over and over. What's going wrong? Download the Spiral project at http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/axamo/2723226 Once the group debugged the Spiral challenge, they then brainstormed follow-up challenges: Can you make the pencil draw a spiraling circle instead of a square?

Now, I think of creative computing as... Creative computing is where design-based learning meets computational thinking and they DANCE! Creative computing has evolved into a new way of looking at the world and using technology to express yourself AND solve problems. I originally thought Scratch was a tool for teaching computing. I now think it is a way to teach almost anything. My thoughts on creative computing have really changed. This is the first time I've been shown a path to a philosophy as second nature and extremely relevant simple or complex, multi-dimensional, inspiring, engaging, allows ""winning"", doable Scratch is very powerful and can engage ALL age levels, very good learning experience My idea of computational computing includes many more concepts and ingredients The workshop created a very safe, collaborative environment where I became more creative Far more complex. Scratch shows few limits and can be used to create so many examples and things. Creative computing involves synthesizing various media to communicate ideas. less intimidated I never realized that serious computing skills could be introduced in such a fun, creative way. Scratch is a great tool to hook young students, especially female, into further studies in computer science. using computers intelligently in a manner that is healthy and rewarding My perspective has been widened. I knew that before but no one else does at my school, so I need to expand their view. works in progress that are shared, repeat forever: imagine, create, play, share, reflect I designed, created, personalized, collaborated, and reflected (a lot!). freedom, collaboration, problem solving involving everyone, not just us computer instructors awesome! inclusive! exciting! I think about creative computing in the same way I think about making art or other projects. I am very process-oriented but I can be frustrated. Working in ""small chunks"" can help me keep things simple. It's for everyone regardless of ability, age, etc! organizational thinking personalization The Media Lab was an eye opener! Wow wow wow (jealous) learning different approaches accessible, concrete, fun, challenging, creative expression, collaborative, experiment When I return to my students, I plan to... I've already made plans to present to my local ed tech group. I've also contacted my super about presenting, and I'm still here use different exercises use Scratch in the computer science classroom and Scratch in a meditation I will give and Scratch in the math department foster more creativity: offer more choice with projects find more ways to integrate computers and Scratch into existing curriculum Scratch has a much wider use than I first thought so I need to get other teachers involved and excited get them creating and producing with Scratch use Scratch with my students, along with the other ""stuff"" in the class revise lessons, chunk learning, break parts into manageable activities introduce the students to the connection between Scratch and robotics Design-based learning is a great new approach for my room. Reflect is so important! create a project notebook I am excited to take Scratch back to my school and use with my middle school students. The resources will help guide me. use the Scratch cards as ""mini-lessons"" within the sixth grade choice-based program I look forward to seeing how my kinds' input will change the way I approach things. I will load Scratch and start using it in my fourth grade class. I plan to incorporate the creative design model into my classroom. I'm bringing back new teaching methods for my work with teachers as well as with students. I plan to use Scratch in the beginning of the CS classes to aid in describing OOP. Scratch Scratch Scratch! need to get as many students as are interested to start on Scratch and share EVERYTHING!! I will give my students more ""play"" time. I'm excited about how this can be used in art. I can't wait to take this back. increase flexibility and freedom introduce game design into curriculum attend Scratch Day, interact with educators on ScratchEd, show teachers and students that they can create games that accommodate learners' needs create bulletin boards for students to post: goals, reflections, challenges/questions (like we did in the Media Lab)"13914	Super Scratch Programming Adventure!

Since I am a new educator, I want to ask questions about my story; 1-Is there any curriculum or outline that may  help me to interact more with those 6 years kids? 2- How could I support kids' development of computational thinking ? they explored those scripts without any help from .....I think they explored and tried 3- Kids were very delighted and happy during learning and exploring ...that encouraged me to think of making research about that and introduce it to schools to be part of the educational curriculum in my country ....could you tell me how to organize my conclusions ? I hope you all share your ideas and suggestions ...I am eager  to hear about your stories.

I have throughout the past 3 years during my undergraduate studies and now phd been researching in Primary Schools (Elementary school) with Scratch and getting the children to create their own games. however the aim of this is ideally to enable the class teachers to teach Scratch and game making (Game design is a part of the Computing Science Curriculum within Scotland). now that I hav eundertaken pilot studies in school I am now preparing teachers to teach the 8 lesson game making course totheir students (ages 8-11) and am creating a teacher guide for them. However what I was wondering is do any educators have any Frequently asked questions from students they would like to share? Personally I have noticed a pattern and in fact on 2 questions crop up time after time. I would like others to share their experiences though in order to compare.

I love the FlowGo Hardware (but can't afford a load of them at £99 each) and I don't love the GO software (compared to Scratch :) ) so I've taken the pi-face interface software (July 2012 edition) and modified it so that you can control the GPIO pins on a RaspberryPi and therefore start using Scratch to control external devices as cheaply as possible.

Here is a recap and some reflections from the event: Attendees Below is a list of people who attended the meetup on Saturday: Sandra Bleecker Lawrence Burns Janet Dee Rosie Delacruz Fran DeMoura John Gomes Ingrid Gustafson Megan Haddadi Lorraine Leo Helen Mastico Chris Mosier Rosemary Slattery Meaghan Worcester Karen Brennan Michelle Chung Laura Johnson Tomoko Matsukawa Rupangi Sharma To connect with someone from the meetup, click on a name above and leave a message on their profile page. Recap Getting to Know You - Upon arrival, each attendee was asked to share a powerful summer learning experience and one goal for this year on large sticky notes. Introductions - We went around the circle and each shared our name, where we're from, our Scratch background, and one thing we want to explore next. Breakout Sessions - Participants separated into teams of four to brainstorm breakout session ideas. Then, the group collectivly decided on the agenda for the rest of the afternoon. Three breakout session topics emerged: Exploring Scratch 2.0, Scratch Professional Development, and Using Scratch Across the Curriculum. Photos - Here are pictures from the meetup. Announcements Interested in testing Scratch 2.0? Sign up here. Check out the new Super Scratch Programming Adventure! book. Questions and Suggestions Rosemary suggested an App Inventor Meetup. Participants expressed interested in a session to learn more about Scratch 2.0 (ie: clone and cloud variable features) and having more hands-on design challenges. Fran requested that Scratch 2.0 be developed for as many platforms as possible in order for Scratch to reach a wide audience. Rosie was curious if there is a Scratch reference guide. One is available here. Another suggestion is to use ctrl + click (right click) on blocks to access the help menu in Scratch or explore other reference guides on ScratchEd. Another participant was interested in being able to carry scripts across multiple sprites. Suggestions for the Scratch 2.0 paint editor: eraser tool, line tool, fill bucket is confusing, larger pen size options Someone pointed out that Scratch 2.0 should give automatic attribution to sprite creators when sharing sprites using the backpack feature. Join us for the next Scratch Educator Meetup on Saturday, November 10 at MIT. Registration is available at http://2012-2013meetups.eventbrite.com.

(we may switch to Arduino in one version, but I would still need to trigger the Arduino from Scratch).  We had the following ideas: 1) Have he Scratch program trigger the lighting of an LED, which a carefully constructed NXT light sensor could detect and then fire the silly string 2) Somehow send a signal to the NXT from Scratch 3) Have a small section of the screen (which we have the light detector pointing toward (with light shields so it only sees one small corner) and we change the color from black to white on that section when we want to fire the NXT.

Dear European Scratchers present at ScratchMIT2012 , dear Scratch team, dear others who I think want to hear about this, At ScratchMIT2012 it was suggested to ""use"" the odd years for Scarcth conferences outside MIT, that is on other continents with the suggestion of Barcelona  for 2013. With this mail I want to quickly check out if there's enough interest to start the dirty work. I'll explain why I'm interested in it and will end with a short questonniaire. People attending at ScratchMIT2012 are roughly in one of three categories Scratch professionals People doing amazing stuff with Scratch they want to share People ""just"" doing amazing things with Scratch who are curious to meet others engaged with Scratch It's for this third category that I want to bring the conference to Europe. Like the teachers and librarians form East Coast US find it affordable to visit Cambridge, the same kind of people from European countries may find a European conference ""worth a detour"". I realize that they are also  attracted by the presenters mentioned as 1 and 2. Last three months I tried to work things out with Frank Sabaté, Jordi Freixenet, Eduard Muntaner and Teresa Ferrer, the  Catalans present at ScratchMIT2012. It turned out that pretty soon there was a date, a venue and ... then things came to a halt as no funding was guaranteed. Talks with Barcelona government showed that they like to co-operate but not on the short term of less then one year. My two reasons in favor of Barcelona were the strong local Scratch community (see http://scratchcatala.com) and the fact that partnering with others makes the effort much more doable. Now Barcelona isn't an option anymore I rethought on a conference in The Netherlands andI like to do it. More precisely I'm prepared for 100s of hours of work, beginning with getting commitment from you (this mail) and local organizations. I just noticed that this weekend the Scarcth team is residing in London, UK see  http://lanyrd.com/2012/mozilla-festival/  I'm happy to come over and start working on this 2013 conference idea. Sundaynight, monday or whatever suits better. The questions I would want your ""first thought"" answer on are: Do you consider spending some days at ScracthAMS2013? Do you like to present something on this conference? Can you be of help organizing this conference (funding, communications, commitee, ...)? Looking forward hearing from you.

Strategies create videos for students, like Colin's Scratch Challenges (http://scratched.media.mit.edu/resources/scratch-challenges-curriculum-beginner-advanced) offer a menu of challenge choices give a general challenge, then giving suggestions for adaptations to individual students build culture of asking a neighbor encourage kids to share their expertise in the classroom respond to the ""I'm done"" by asking the students to add layers give students freedom in process by providing them with a project specification sheet (e.g. needs to have a score, multiple players)"15012	Breakout Session Notes: Facilitating Scratch Professional Development (November 2012 Meetup)	11/13/12 22:56	"Notes by Janet Dee from PD for Teachers breakout session at November Meetup Teachers like the workbook/handout: one side has the content and the other side has the Scratch solution They want the mapping from content to tool Need concise workbook for the lesson: it’s a teaching tool Way you do professional development with teachers depends on time, numbers and what is the end goal? Differentiated instruction: Demo of the Scratch program. Very basic Take to the Scratch Site for the possibilities Show the variety of subject areas that can be covered Depends on Time: The one hour thing: introduce Scratch, then get them to start exploring The next part of the challenge: get a character to do a certain amount of movement Next part is to share what you have done One Hour Covers: INTRODUCTION EXPLORATION SHARING REFLECTION Second Hour Covers: Decide area: storytelling, games, simulations Assign specific challenges (Ideas for challenges: take certain blocks and create, take certain sprites and create) Reflect on how it can be used in their discipline: Teacher and tech person need to work together—how do you enable that? Create curriculum in teams over the summer where the teams are content teacher and tech person What is the end goal of the PD? Could you have the content teachers then teach their colleagues, as in Train the Trainer Or is it to have the teachers have one unit that they can implement right away Karen Lang’s presentation at MASSCUE: She got everyone to program together: group coding We will find her presentation on the MASSCUE Ning and share with others She used a sandbox approach ----- Notes by Laura Johnson from the PD discussion at 11/10 meetup if you were holding a 1 hour PD session, what would you include? Focus on tech skills rather than instructional support (i.e. how to use Scratch rather than how to teach Scratch) because -the curriculum guide and Scratch cards are sufficient tools for learning how to incorporate Scratch into the classroom -the PD leader can’t know how Scratch will fit into the curriculum of every teacher in the session, but can instruct everyone how to use the program -however, it is extremely helpful for the leader to be able to offer suggestions on how to adapt the program to use in certain subjects/classroom environments i.e. foreign language, science, etc. -teachers want: -to know what they’re teaching -to appear competent / a manual so they never look like they don’t know something -to know how to assess student work -explicit links from a process to a Scratch block Key components are: 1st hour session -introduction to basic capabilities of the program -exploring the program through samples and hands-on activity -sharing/reflecting on possibilities of use in specific instructional settings 2nd hour session -hands-on challenge -more in depth tech support -context influences what types of things you need to learn within the program -can use context to preselect Scratch blocks/features to explore -building topics based on groups of blocks There needs to be a shift from teacher/expert to responsible facilitator. Scratch is a safe space for this type of shift – kids and teachers are learning the program at the same time Live coding (having Scratch projected on a large screen while doing a group-think/crowd-sourced challenge) is a good way to bring this culture shift into a PD session -PD facilitator can model ways to deal with uncertainty/mistakes while showing how to use the program (Example: Karen Lang – MassCue conference presentation) The format and content of a PD session depends on: Time available School policy: is the PD on something that is being integrated one classroom at a time / on a voluntary basis or something that the administration has mandated for the whole school End goal: should the PD participants be able to complete 1 project with the edtech by the end or be able to use every aspect of the software? -Depends on the participants Most PD leaders want to be able to “light a fire” under more than one teacher at a time – large group sessions are more valuable than 1 on 1 meetings, but it’s harder to customize those interactions Relying on the kids to transfer their knowledge and skills to teachers isn’t enough When you have a PD session with teachers from different subjects the format should be: Demo Overview of Scratch site Samples showing the capability of the program Resources on ScratchEd Manual for initial training to Scratch use guide isn’t used People have different preferences regarding learning how to use the program. Handout Individual exploring Challenges Teachers are like kids in their enthusiasm for the program, but teachers want to get it right, want to understand what’s going on Meta-perspective: want to connect it to the classroom Whose job is it to tie Scratch to the curriculum? Tech person + teacher -it’s a two way street that can move from a lesson plan to Scratch integration or from Scratch capabilities to lesson plan The ideal PD scenario is to work with specialized groups but a secondary way to get to that is following a train the trainer model Teachers create their own specialized groups building off of the first, more general PD sessions and then can focus on tying things to their specific curricular topics ----- Notes by Rupangi Sharma on Scratch PD breakout session at the November 2012 Meetup – Looking at a way to introduce educators who are new to Scratch by reflecting on Karen Lang’s presentation (Karen modeled her presentation at MASSCUE on the CS4HS workshop at MIT Media Lab). Involving the audience of educators by making them program along with the presenter. – Involving them in programming in such a way that they are in the shoes of students and the presenter takes on the role of the educator- so the presentation gives educators a sample of what a classroom involved with programming through Scratch looks like and gets hands- on experience. – We also spoke about how it is necessary to show educators all that is possible with Scratch- showing them the extent to which students can get creative with Scratch. – It was important, we noted, to also make Scratch relevant to educators by showing them how Scratch can be used in their classroom to teach their particular subject, whether it be science, math or performing arts. – We discussed the importance of curriculum guides and resources like the cards but, we pointed out how sometimes the variety of resources available can be overwhelming so it is advisable to point to specific resources that educators who are new to Scratch can use. – The PD group wanted to see Karen Lang’s presentation on the Scratch Ed website"15013	Breakout Session Notes: Next Steps After Scratch (November 2012 Meetup)	11/13/12 23:04	"Notes by Rupangi Sharma from the Next Steps breakout session at the November 2012 Scratch Educator Meetup Pamela spoke eloquently about how it is important to be explicit about the learning objectives and goals that the students will be achieving so that they can measure how much they have learnt, on their own and get excited by their progress when they see it happen. We discussed Scratch and how it is often seen as a stepping stone to other programming languages and stressed the importance of recognizing Scratch as a programming language that holds its own because it has a lot of capabilities. ----- Notes by Laura Johnson Pam – inherited a curriculum that she tweaked and is coming from an AP Computer Science background (more traditional) – has to make a shift from teacher to facilitator; is learning and teaching at the same time à has given her perspective of what her students are going through and the students can point out holes in the curriculum/lessons Processing addresses Scratch’s limitations Why not Python? Colin doesn’t know Python; Processing is what Arduino uses (big in the Maker world) PROBLEMS WITH THE SWITCH Method Syntax Variables Instantiation of objects Scratch is real programming and powerful but doesn’t look like it. Things that prompt students to want to switch Complicated things with sounds Wanted to use the webcam Fiducials? Scratch vs. Processing Flags vs. code Don’t need to code variables vs. coding for variables/heavy usage of variables Blocks vs. code Kids can troubleshoot (syntax errors aren’t a challenge) vs. teachers troubleshoot to find small details Allows for creativity, can work on big picture concepts vs. frustrated by small details in code Scratch 2.0 could fix some of the transition issues Cloning = instantiation Make a block = parameters To make the switch Project done in Scratch and same project done in Processing Parallel teaching – out of comfort zone and then back to Scratch; build up tolerance for frustration"15014	"Reflections on Scratch Educator Meetup @ MIT: Saturday, November 10, 2012"	11/13/12 23:18	"Thanks to everyone who joined us at the November 2012 Scratch Educator Meetup!

Activity Brainstorm One of my students recently shared how she used playing non-digital games as a starting point for developing digital games. I thought that this might be an interesting starting-point for our breakout session. In our breakout, we brainstormed a list of non-digital games we enjoy playing, without worrying about how easy or hard it would be to implement these games in Scratch. Scrabble Boggle Battleship Dress up games Candyland Jenga Lingo/Bingo Apples to apples Where's Waldo? Monopoly Sudoku Word search Line games Sand drawing game Tetris Mousetrap Operation 2. Scratch 2.0 Features Following the games brainstorm, we explored Scratch 2.0, making a list of new features. After 7 or 8 minutes, we regrouped and shared some of the new features that we had noticed, which included make a block, clone, video motion, cloud variables/lists. 3. Project Development We returned to our list of games, looking for a game that would be (1) reasonably easy to implement, given the limited time we had, and (2) might have an interesting connection to one or more of the new features in Scratch 2.0. We converged on a body-part matching game -- you have a skeleton and a collection of internal organs (off to the side), and you place the internal organs in the correct position on the skeleton. After working on the project for about 40 minutes, we took a break to reflect and share our experiences. A few notes: The visuals are an important part of this project, and it took a while to find good visual assets. (A challenge further compounded by the very buggy paint editor!) There are multiple ways of implementing the ""matching"" check. For example, Derek used an ""invisible target"" approach and I used a coordinate-checking mechanism. (I liked Derek's approach more!) There are multiple ways of implementing the internal-organ dragging. For example, making the individual sprites draggable versus having the individual sprites follow the mouse pointer. Generally, I thought that this was going to be a super easy project, but it was more involved than I anticipated -- and could easily be done with Scratch 1.4, not really an exploration of new features in Scratch 2.0. An interesting learning experience overall! I'm sure I'm missing details -- I hope my fellow breakout group members will add their comments/reflections/reactions!

Recap Meet up with Me: Celebrating CSEdWeek! - At the beginning of the meetup, attendees filled out a networking worksheet. To kick-off CSEdWeek taking place this week, we asked each person to share their thoughts on what students should learn about computing and computer science. Introductions - Karen facilitated introductions by having people share their names, familiarity with Scratch, and goals for the day. Breakout Sessions - Based on participants' goals, Karen organized three hands-on breakout sessions for the morning: Michelle facilitated a ""Getting Started with Scratch"" session with people who were new to Scratch and wanted an introduction to the program and resources, Colin is interested in using Scratch with the XBOX Kinect sensor and decided to work on building an interactive program with Jeff, and Karen organized a Scratch 2.0 breakout session to brainstorm new game activities for the Scratch curriculum guide. Show & Tell - Over a Chipotle lunch, we hosted a Show & Tell session for attendees to share some of their students' work. Barbara gave us an update on her new after-school Scratch Club, Rosemary shared projects from a recent Scratch workshop she hosted at a library in Peabody, MA, ScratchEd intern Tomoko described her research project and asked people to fill out a short survey about how they help students reflect on their creative processes, and Colin demonstrated the Scratch+Kinect project he designed with Jeff during the breakout sessions.

We hope that you'll join us at the next Scratch Educator Meetup on Saturday, January 12. Registration is available at http://2012-2013meetups.eventbrite.com. Happy Holidays and see you next year!"15428	A New Kid on the Blog	12/10/12 23:47	"I have just launched a blog, www.scratch-blog.com, where I share the mathematics and programming techniques used in the projects I upload to Scratch (search popswilson). I write a detailed paper for each project and distribute these as pdf files, announced on the blog, and avaialble on request by sending an email to grandadscience@gmail.com. I will not upload any project in the future without documentation. The free-form environment offered by Scratch is a wonderful place to play and create. But there are those users that are interested in mathematics and in acquiring new programming skills. My blog is designed to offer interested  members of this group the opportunity to dive a bit deeper into mathematics and programming. Visit my blog and find out if it interests you. If so, visit often. Direct students to my blog. They might find an interesting topic or two to explore. The decision to start a blog originated from a comment a user made about my Lindenmayer Systems project uploaded to Scratch. His comment was positive but also asked a question. How does that work? No math, science, or programmiing teacher can resist answering that question. So, trhe blog is my answer. To learn is to be alive!"15434	Flash	12/11/12 13:59	I noticed that the flash player is not uploading projects at our school. Will support for Java end with version 2.0 or is 2.0 compatible with HTML 5? Thx15437	Critical thinking	12/11/12 21:35	"William Whitlock Professor Kimball and class, This a post for Unit 8 and is a copy of a relative research article from the internet How Are Metacognitive Strategies Transferred? The application of metacognitive strategies in contexts other than those in which they were learned is the primary goal of teaching thinking. Transfer is the educational term for this reuse of strategies. Research supports a positive correlation between instruction in metacognitive strategies and transfer. A distinction is usually made between near transfer and far transfer, the former being when learning is applied in circumstances similar to initial learning, and the latter occurring when connections are made to dissimilar contexts. In If Minds Matter Perkins and Salomon (1992) talk about the fuzziness of near-far transfer and the difficulty in measuring the extent of transfer. In reporting on research in metacognition in ""Metacognition Research andTheory: Analysis and Implications for Instructional Design"" Osman and Hannafin (1993) manage to defuzz the issue of transfer by classifying metacognitive training strategies into four types, each of which promote transfer somewhat differently. These additional benchmarks allow educational practictioners to gauge transfer more accurately and design instruction which exploits the transfer potential of different metacognitive strategies. It is this classification scheme that has repeatedly drawn me back to this particular article, an article that at once clarifies both metacognition and transfer, and has practical application to instructional design. It is this perspective that serves as a backdrop for the remainder of this report, a report which presents my interpretation of this article. As criteria for their classification of metacognitive training strategies Osman and Hannafin (1992) used ""training approach"" and ""relationship to lesson content"". They describe metacognitive training strategies that may be embedded, or integrated within a criterion lesson and strategies which may be taught separately - detached - from academic subjects. With respect to the role of lesson content strategies may be dependent on, or independent of, content.Content-dependentstrategies focus explicitly on concepts that promote learning of particular content. Conversely, content-independent strategies are content-free, general strategies not specific to particular academic subjects. The four resultant strategies are described below. Embedded Content-Dependent Strategies Embedded content-dependent strategies emphasize near transfer. They are useful in understanding unfamiliar lesson material. They are specific strategies that support particular content and as such require explicit manipulation of lesson content and structure. Embedded Content-Independent Strategies Embedded content-independent strategies are general strategies that support particular content but are transferable to content of other lessons. Specific content is used to learn strategies but once learned executive control shifts from the lesson to the student. Detached Content-Dependent Strategies Detached content-dependent strategies are general strategies taught separately from content but meant to be applied within particular content. The intention is to improve facility with strategies before using them in context. They hold more potential for transfer than embedded content-dependent strategies. Detached Content-Independent Strategies Detached content-independent strategies are taught separately from content and are generic in nature. As such they support a variety of learning tasks and academic subjects. They help students to manipulate lesson material as well as to develop and maintain learning strategies. These strategies often focus more on procedural than conditional knowledge but the goal is strategy generalization and promotion of independent learning. They provide the greatest potential for transfer, that of far transfer. What is Metacognition? How are Metacognitive Strategies Transferred? Elements of Metacognition: What is Transferred? What are the Implications for Instructional Design?

Tips and Talking Points for Parents Emphasize that we are in an era and a world where computer skills are essential to success. Scratch gives kids a programming foundation and builds interest in computer skills. Find a few great/varied Scratch projects to share with parents. Scratch makes Math real (ie: coordinate planes) Create an online video of kids talking about what Scratch is and why they enjoy working with it, fast-paced cuts/integrated with Mitch Resnick/ScratchEd commentary - 5 minute ""teaser"" type of video Scratch promotes explanatory discourse naturally. Learning by creating is more powerful than just consuming! Smile the whole time and use the words ""STEM programming"". Don't be afraid to allow your child to join the Scratch community. Interest-driven application of math, science, and imagination Scratch can be liberating for learners who are non-traditonal. Start by presenting compelling Scratch game for them to play, then remix! Can build Scratch projects as a family Tell them it was developed by MIT. Benefits of Scratch: creativity, intro to programming, critical thinking, problem solving, computational thinking, etc. Benefits of online account: collaboration, authentic audience, feedback The Scratch website is a great place for your kids to learn through the examples of others.

Once you click on the green flag, each letter moves leaving a color trail. When you stop or restart it always continues with the colors over the black; however if you close the file and reopen it, you start over -- letters in a line with the black stage. Every time my students close and then reopen their file, they get exactly what they had when they stopped. What needs to be done so that it always starts at the beginning the file is first opened.

We are a group in at the educational development firm, TERC, composed of experienced science experts and informal educators who have worked with Scratch. Our work focuses on environmental education, particularly around energy use, energy conservation, and climate change behaviors, and builds on previous activities with girl scouts on the same topic. The exact time and days of the week during February vacation week will be determined based on the girls’ availability and parents’ schedules. We are expecting that girls will come to TERC for multiple days for around 10 hours total. If you are interested, please contact, Elisabeth Sylvan, at sylvan@terc.edu or response to this thread.

I want to use the braille part for showing text and and the buttons for input. I am a experienced programmer and teacher which made software to teach children braille by computer (braillestudio).

I am an artist and an art educator.  Within the past two years, I have become very interested in incorporating technology in my lessons for children.  Now I am teaching video game design with Scratch and the new course I am desiging is not very long in time.  I am thinking the children may not have time to draw their own original sprites and stages.  Ultimately they will have to use the already created sprites and stages which they will have to import from the files of images saved in Scratch.  This sacrifice of drawing their own sprite and stage upsets the artist side of me. Do you think it is a bad idea to have the chldren use the already created sprites and stages for the sake of saving time to learn the programming? The goal of the course is to teach children, whom have never used computers before, to confidently use computers and to problem solve with technology. Thank you for any advice you can give.

I'm a teacher for EDP and informatics and want to start learning programming with my pupils with scratch and an remote controlled model car (i-racer). Therefore i would like to extend an scratch project with blocks similiar to the motor-blocks for LEGO WeDo. Or is there another way to send some custom bytes via Bluetooth from an Scratch-Programm to my I-Racer? What I found so far: Snap! (BYOB) -  but this seems not to provide the necessary flexibility to code the blocks with Smalltalk,  it rather provides a mechanism of organizing the existing blocks.

I'm writing a video game design course for middle school aged children.  The course will be broken up into three sections and logically they will be: Introduction to Programming & Video Game Design, Video Game Design I and Video Game Design II. The goal of the course is to teach the children to feel comfortable using technology, to have fun while problem solving with technology and to be expressive and creative with technology. In the Introduction part of the course the children will learn about the various terms used when programming and how to use Scratch.  My questions are as follows: 1.  Is coding or programming the best way to describe what they do with Scratch?  What is more commonly used?  Or more importantly what term is a better explanation of what they are doing? 2.  What should I tell the students they are called?  For example: Video Game Designers, Programmers, Developers.  Which description is the most appropirate for what they will be doing? 3.  What is the best way to describe Scratch?  I know in the Scratch videos created by Scratch it is referred to as a programming language.  Is it correct to always refer to it as the Scratch programming languge?  Is fine to say, "" Today you will learn how to use the Scratch program""? I taught with Scratch in the past but that course was a summer camp and there wasn't enough time to cover too much. The program I'm developing now is longer and much more involved in the terms and goes into the many types of projects that can be created with Scratch (the first projects will be animated stories and interactive art).

Two month after the announcement I'm overwhelmed by all the positive feedback so far. There is a broad group from all over Europe in the team to make this an exciting and amazing event. We gave a tight deadline, you had just six weeks, for proposals to participate in any form. We received almost 80 proposals from 20 countries. Varied in their topics, formats, ... but consistent in quality. There was some fuzz in European news on excellent universities ... Scratch2013BCN will have 9 speakers from the top5 universities worldwide! And much more. If you come to the conference you can be sure you'll get three days packed with ideas, action and inspiration brought to you buy fellow mebers of ScratchED. The deadline is extended with two weeks, it's March 15 now. We're especially interested in a little more ""smaller"" contributions like Ignite presentations (5 minutes) and participation in poster sessions or demo's, but you should noyt feel limited by this.

For supporting students... harlem shake! start small and test often! encourage project sharing and remixing what would a book report look like in Scratch? independent, personal instruction: creating short videos describing key elements of Scratch that can be embedded or available to students when there are Scratch questions, utilize the resource available (ie: Google your Scratch question) letting students capture themselves in pictures or videos to share their personal interests, skills, goals get started with sensors using the microphone (ie: the loudness/loud? block) animate the students' concert song for using Scratch + WeDo,  start small: 1 sprite, 1 sensor assessment ideas: badges, rubrics, interviews incorporate classroom assignments (ie: create a maze of the digestive system) For supporting teachers... make it practical: engage educators in lesson planning, make Scratch relevant for their classes have a beginner's mind hijack the class, but let the teacher stay in the room and have them participate along with their students leverage students as teachers/mentors What other suggestions do you have?"17045	"Reflections on Scratch Educator Meetup @ MIT: Saturday, March 9, 2013"	3/12/13 12:00	"Special thanks to everyone who joined us for the March 2013 Scratch Educator Meetup!

Recap Networking: Who's Here? Tag Cloud - At the beginning of the meetup, attendees participated in a self-tagging networking activity. Each person created four to five keywords describing themselves and their work, and then, collectively shared their tags on a whiteboard. The activity was used to facilitate networking and to give a sense of who was at the meetup. Introductions - During introductions, people shared their names, where they are from, and their experiences using Scratch. Breakout Sessions - After some group brainstorming, two types of breakout sessions emerged: hands-on with Scratch 2.0 and the LEGO WeDo, and a discussion around helping people (students and teachers) use Scratch. Show & Tell - We hosted a short Show & Tell session over a delicious lunch of Chipotle burritos and chips. Lorraine shared a large-scale, collaborative Scratch project that she is currently working on with Japanese Scratch educators, Yoshiro Miyata. Derek, who was inspired by last meetup's design challenge, presented his space invader's game created in Scratch 2.0. You can watch video of these Show & Tell presentations here on ScratchEd. Group Discussion - At the end of the meetup, the group shared lesson plan ideas and discussed strategies for supporting both students and teachers.

Recap Networking: Who's Here? Tag Cloud - At the beginning of the meetup, attendees participated in a self-tagging, ice-breaker activity. Each person wrote on their nametag four to five keywords that described themselves and their work. Participants were then asked to share their tags on a whiteboard, which served as our collective meetup tag cloud. The activity was used to help facilitate networking and to give a sense of who was at the event. Introductions - During introductions, people shared their names, where they are from, and their past experiences using Scratch. Breakout Sessions - After a round of think-pair-share brainstorming, two types of breakout sessions emerged: hands-on explorations of Scratch 2.0 and WeDo sensors, and a discussion around how to support diverse learners (students and teachers) in using Scratch. Since everyone expressed interested to both breakouts, we decided to spend most of morning playing with Scratch and the LEGO WeDo Construction Kit, and to then to hold a big group discussion over lunch. During the hands-on session, Cindy led a small group in thinking about how to introduce students to the WeDo sensors, while others explored some of new features in Scratch 2.0, coming with different ways to tackle a maze challenge. Show & Tell - Two educators demonstrated recently created Scratch projects during Show & Tell, which was held at the beginning of a delicious lunch of Chipotle burritos and chips with guacamole. Lorraine shared a large-scale, collaborative Scratch project involving her students and other international classrooms. Derek, who was inspired by the last meetup's design challenge, described how he used the new cloning feature in Scratch 2.0 to produce an amazing space invaders game replica. You can watch videos of the Show & Tell presentations on ScratchEd. Group Discussion - After Show & Tell, Michelle led a whole-group discussion around lesson plan ideas and strategies for supporting both students and teachers learning about Scratch.

The conference theme is Intersections: Teaching and Learning Across Media. Here is an excerpt about the event from the conference website at http://namle.net/conference: Disruption is a watchword for the time we live in: competing social networking platforms, ever-shifting working styles, novel job descriptions displacing the old, manifold curricular and performance demands. With all these possibilities vying for our buy-in, it is vital to seek commonalities. It is at the intersections that we will begin to make sense and make use of a media revolution well underway and yet incompletely understood by our educational infrastructure. This conference will highlight the role of media literacy educators’ capacity to take a leading role in this nationwide task. Media-savvy educators now have the chance to articulate how new pedagogies can erect road signs at the intersections where communication practices, platforms, and cultures cross paths. Disciplines of thought and method can merge to form innovative perspectives, refreshing the way we approach problems and generating paths of study relevant to 21st Century careers, citizens, relationships and lifestyles. The 2013 NAMLE conference will reflect the reality that education is at a cross roads, with opportunities to push the boundaries in mixing old and new media, as well as combining no-, low-, and high-tech interactions that encourage society to share in the cultural production process of sense and meaning making."17377	Super Scratch Folder & Writing in Spanish	3/25/13 17:04	"Friends, I can't find the Super Scratch Folder that is mentioned in the book Super Scratch Programming Adventure by the Lead Project.

Laura Johnson took some notes of the discussion that are shared here: Specifications: - start with one row of blocks and one ball --> have to move the ball to the wall of blocks using the paddle - when the ball hits the blocks – > block has to disappear - 3 choices for triggering disappearance: paint a block in the background and using ""touching"" block sprite hitting sprite coordinates > ball has to change direction - how to simulate the angle that would result in the real world? Questions / Considerations: - how to decide what level of specification to offer students regarding game mechanics? --> dependent on time and level of students - storyboarding / psuedo-flowcharting is helpful to plan game - using this as an advanced Scratch activity, but still providing various levels of challenges within it - pros and cons of showing students the final product (as in, this is what you're aiming for) vs. telling them the specifications and letting them conceptualize it themselves - value in taking time to discuss various approaches to the same problem / set of constraints, are some better than others? Do you have other suggestions for specifications/questions/considerations? Please share them below!"17883	"Kids Hackathon on 28th of April in Berlin, Germany"	4/17/13 14:48	"Official Blog post: blog.opentechschool.org/2013/04/first-kids-hackathon-in-berlin.html Languages spoken: English, German, and a few more.

Recap Networking: What do you want to do today? - Attendees were asked what goals/questions/expectations they had for the meetup. These were captured on sticky notes and collected on the reflection wall to help shape the day's agenda. Introductions - During introductions, Michelle gathered everyone in a circle and asked each person to say their name, three words/phrases to describe themself, and one goal or question they had shared during the ""What do you want to do today?"" activity. Breakout Sessions - Based on participants' interests at the meetup, two main breakout groups emerged. Colin and Gina led a hands-on session with Scratch 2.0, including working on design challenges, WeDo/Kinect extensions, and trying out new camera feature. Across the room, Janet led a discussion session around using Scratch with high school students. Check out Laura's discussion notes here and Janet's reflections here. Photos - Check out photos from the gathering on the ScratchEd Flickr pool. Show & Tell Presentations Rosemary S. presented maze projects created by her high school students and talked about different ways students could add extensions to a basic maze, for example, adding levels, score, a timer, or enemies. Colin, Jesse, Rosemary B., and Mike demonstrated their Rube Goldberg machine, combining the WeDo, Kinect, and Scratch 2.0. Anne Marie shared two projects made by middle school students she works with. The first is a book report that a group of students requested to present using Scratch and the second is a physics game inspired by Angry Birds. Gina, Karen, and Jeff talked about what they discovered about the new camera feature in Scratch 2.0 while collaboratively building an interactive trampoline project. Doug presented on his use of Scratch with local high school students, describing his curriculum and sharing some example projects. Karen gave a quick update about Scratch Day 2013 and the MIT's Scratch Day event. Do you have any other reflections, questions, or suggestions about the meetup?

I see a few planned Scratch Day events in my region, but nothing close by yet. I would be interested in co-organizing a Scratch Day as well as collaboration on individual Scratch projects. I would also be interested in simply connecting with any ScratchED users in my area. I am just now getting into Scratch as a student and parent. I have previous experience with QBasic in high school, and spent most of my youth running dial-up and telnet BBSs, programming and building MUDs and BBS Door games, and creating/downloading MOD and MIDI songs. I have been exploring technology over the years at an informal pace and am formally switching to an IT track in futures soon. A favorite pasttime lately has been integrating Scratch with MaKey MaKey. I am learning the basics about Arduino, Python, RaspberryPi, 3D printing, a variety of other exciting experiences at my local Makerspace/Hackerspace. I place a lot of value in kinesthetic learning and visual programming languages like Scratch. I like that the spirit of programming and coding is very much a part of Scratch just as the spirit of innovation is captured in MaKey MaKey's open versatility in simplicity. Tools such as Scratch are very positive and fertile atmospheres for both transitioning into more sophisticated and traditional text-based syntax-centric languages while teaching the important basics in a fun way. I have toyed around with remixing, and am looking at picking up pace to delve into more of what Scratch has to offer. I would be interested in collaborating on advanced Scratch projects with others, especially anything that can be turned into a ScratchED resource or has useful academic value. I am currently working on a series of educational curriculum-based games that parody different genres of popular games and could definitely use creative and multi-talented co-conspirators. Also looking for insight and feedback."18112	"Getting Ready for Scratch 2.0 webinar - Friday, May 3 at 6pm EDT"	4/28/13 11:34	"Getting Ready for Scratch 2.0 Google+ Hangout On Air Friday, May 3 6:00 - 7:00pm EDT (check your local time) Hosted by the ScratchEd Team Teachers -- are you ready for the next generation of Scratch?

Recap Networking: What do you want to do today? - As participants arrived, they were asked to share their name and place on the networking wall, giving everyone a sense of who was present at the meetup. Introductions - Gathered in a circle of chairs, Michelle asked each person to share their name, three words/phrases to describe him or herself, and one goal for the meetup. Breakout Sessions - After a quick round of think-pair-share to brainstorm breakout session ideas on large sticky notes, Derek and Laura helped arrange the post-its to organize an agenda for the meetup based on participants' interests. It was clear that everyone was interested in trying out Scratch 2.0, so the first 30-minute breakout led by Karen consisted of an exploratory hands-on session with Scratch. Next, concurrent discussions for using Scratch with the arts, STEM subjects, and in early educational settings took place in small breakout groups. Eat Dessert First! - To celebrate the recent release of Scratch 2.0 and the final Scratch educator meetup of the academic year, educators continued discussions and networking over custom Chipotle and chips orders, followed by chocolate mousse cake from Flour.

Are there any safeguards so that random people can't contact them privately? I'd like my students to be able to remix but I have reservations about letting them sign up for accounts.

My name is Joe Young, I am a Teen Services Library Assistant at Hercules Public Library in Hercules, CA.  I am currently working on a grant proposal to fund a Creative Computing class at my library; one aspect of the program I am proposing would be staff training by a Scratch expert to help other library staff in my organization develop Creative Computing classes at their community libraries.  Does this project sound like something you would like to participate in?  We would, of course, provide a fee for the staff training session and take care of any travel arrangements that would be necessary. A little information about my library:  Contra Costa County Library is a public library system that provides services to residents of California state.  There are 26 community libraries and patrons can access a variety of resources and materials online as well.  The county itself is a primarily suburban county in the San Francisco Bay area, with slightly over one million residents as of the 2010 census. Regarding the proposed training:  We would be aiming for a Winter 2013 or Spring 2014 date for the training.  We would like to host the training in a centralized location in the county to allow for interested staff from all branches to be able to attend.  Depending on the cost associated with the training, we may be interested in scheduling multiple training sessions.  The purpose of the training would be for staff to develop enough skill with Scratch to be able to use the program, either in conjunction with the Scratch Curricululm Guide or independantly, to implement a Creative Computing class at their community library.  We are looking for an individual with a high level of proficiency using the Scratch program in an educational setting who would feel comfortable providing instruction to a group of 15-20. If you are interested in this opportunity please feel free to contact me at jyoung@ccclib.org; please title your email ""scratch expert for staff training"" and be sure to include, in the body of the email, the fee you would ask to provide training sessions and what travel arrangements would be necessary to accomadate you (if any). Thank you very much for your time and attention!  Please let me know if I can provide any further information about this project.

Cost: $15, which includes parking, breakfast, and lunch ? How: Made possible through funding from Expanding Computing Education Pathways Alliance (ECEP), a National Science Foundation Broadening Participation in Computing Alliance Using computing creatively -- whether for personal expression or for problem solving -- is something that everybody should be able to do. We hope that you will be able to join us for the Creative Computing Symposium on Saturday, July 13 at the Harvard Graduate School of Education. The day-long Symposium is an opportunity to connect with other educators and support each others' learning about creative computing with Scratch. The Symposium also serves as a capstone event for the Creative Computing Online Workshop (CCOW), which began on June 3 and ends on July 12. More than 1,900 educators from around the world are participating in the workshop, which involves hands-on Scratch activities, interactions with other educators, and reflections on practice. Participation in the Online Workshop is not required to attend the Symposium, but Symposium attendees will benefit from having some basic familiarity with Scratch (for example, by completing the Week 1 activities of CCOW). The Symposium is something between a conference and a party -- in the spirit of participatory professional development activities like EdCamp and ScratchEd meetups, the Symposium is an opportunity to connect with colleagues and to deepen your learning. The day begins and ends with formal remarks, but the bulk of the day is segmented into several self-organized breakout sessions. At the beginning of the day, we'll decide on the topics that we would like to explore and then break into groups to pursue the learning that we're most excited about. Want to spend more time hands-on with Scratch? Propose or join a group of builders. Want to make plans and get feedback on a Scratch Club? Find like-minded colleagues for a discussion. This day is about you and your learning.

Translating text is very easy. One project had a help routine that presented how to use the project with both text and audible description. I translated the text and made new sound files in Swedish. The sounds were not as long as the original English and the further into the decription pages, the more out of sync things got. I found the the program had static timed breakpoints that of course didn't fit the new audio. So I rearranged the programming so that it would get each audio chunk and WAIT for it to finish.

Last summer I had the privelege of teaching a 2-day game design course to a room full of approximately 25 6th graders.  Not knowing how in the world I could possibly teach anything worth while in 2 half-day sessions, I turned to an online forum where several people recommended the Scratch programming environment.  Not only was Scratch easy for me as an instructor to pick up and learn, but the wealth of resources on the education site made it easy to find material to present to the class.  What I really wanted to avoid was spending 2 hours hunting down a missing semicolon (which is likely what would have happened if I went with a more ""traditional"" programming language). As a relatively new educator in a rural community, it was a very gratifying experience to get young people excited about Computer Science through game design.  I even had students come to me saying that they didn't want to go to their next sessions so they could stay and work on their Scratch projects.  I'm very proud of my group of budding computer scientists and look forward to investigating new ways of using Scratch inside and outside the classroom!

The blocks are Left, Right, Mid, ToUpperCase and ToLowerCase. A brief description of these: Left(string, n) - Allows you to return the left most n characters of a string, e.g. Left(""Scratch"", 3) will return Scr. Right(string, n) - Allows you to return the right most n characters of a string, e.g. Right(""Scratch"",3) will return tch. Mid(string, start, n) - Allows you to return a specific part of a string, e.g. Mid(""Scratch Programming"", 9, 7) will return Program from the string. ToUpperCase(string) - Allows you to convert a string to upper case. e.g. ToUpperCase(""scratch"") will return SCRATCH and ToLowerCase(""SCRATCH"") will return scratch.

Recap My Summer Vacation - During introductions, Michelle asked participants to gather in a circle and share their name, what they do, and what they did this summer. Breakout Sessions - The agenda was co-constructed by everyone present. We wrote breakout session ideas on large sticky notes and then organizing them on the wall by time/place. Two pairs of 45-minute sessions emerged. During the first set of breakout sessions, Karen and Mitch led a group discussion about the Hour of Code initiative (share your activity ideas in this discussion thread). Next door, Janet introduced strategies for using studios, remixing, and debugging in Scratch. In the follow session, a group was organized around using Scratch in different subjects, during which Derek demoed a maze project, while Ingrid answered questions and shared resources from her experiences using Scratch in middle school. Announcements - The meetup concluded with a design-your-own lunch from Chipotle, networking, and a group-share of announcements for the upcoming month.

I am also part of the Honors Program, and one of the requirements of the Honors Program is a Capstone Project. For this project, I have decided to introduce computer programming to students in the PK-4 grade range through Scratch and other programming software. This coming spring, a program for STEM for teachers is in the works and then a similar program for students will be done next fall. I'm really passionate about this and want to make it the best I can make it, which is why I want real world classroom uses.

We only had a few lessons and they just gave up. :( I am talking with the rest of group (6 of them) and trying to get their feedback about it and I htink the rest are in but still I am reevaluating what I can do to not make this so overwhleming. I am using the Curriculum provided by MIT but I do not have enough time to do the entire lesson at school (I see them every 6 days for 30 minutes) so I use Edmodo (web app) to deliver some of the lessons. I have explained to them that it is like learning a new langauge and you cannot expect to learn Spansih in one day--so just be patienct and it will come! I had them use the All About Me page for guidance on next lesson and I am not going to push them too much with completing the design notebook. I do realize kids have a lot going on at heme and at school and because this is a pilot project it is hard to retrofit this into their busy schedule. Any suggestions or ideas will be appreciated!

Next: Paper Prototype of a controller Students know where they are and where they want to go. b) IDEO shopping cart video c) Film “Objectified” shows examples of Industrial Design d) Kevin Kelly book “What Technology Wants” “Virtually every technology that has been invented is still in use.” 8) Natalie - Advanced Kids Steve - Concrete Chris - Design Process - thinking outside of the box LeeAnn: Where are we going with Scratch and then…. 9) Hack a USB number pad to create a controller 10) Use Legos and Makey Makey to create a controller Break something down and build it back up again Students as hackers - modding 11) The Game “Portal” - Educational Version - Ships with tools - Students can create a maze that has gravity and friction - Portal is actually a nonviolent (shoot the wall, not people) modded version of Half-Life 2 12) Someone did create a Portal game in Scratch 13) If we look at things as a platform to be hacked, another dimension is opened. 14) God mode/Cheat codes are created to allow developers to get through to a level that they are working on! 15) Natalie: Robotics and other program suggestions are going 16) Snap: Developed at Berkley. Berkley built another layer on top of Scratch - Also runs on an Ipad. Has a full curriculum built around it at Berkley - Lectures are online. 17) Ipad Browser - Puffin - allows Scratch programs 18) How to EMBED a project within a website. a) Full screen is great to share with kids b) Vector Graphics - Scalable - Convert before creating sprites c) GoogleSites is great for this d) On Scratch project click “Share” e) Scroll down to “Share to” to see code f) Copy code g) go to Google Site h)  Insert code and click the “HTML” letters above right i) It will be converted to a gadget where you can go in and change things. j) Preview page as viewer k) You can go in and set the width at 100%. k) You can go in and set the width at 100%."23958	Scratch Educator Meetup Breakout Session Notes: Scratch Assessment Strategies	11/22/13 11:30	"Special thanks to Josh Tappan for taking these notes during the ""Scratch Assessment Strategies"" breakout session at the November 2013 Scratch educator meetup, help at MIT on November 2, 2013. Scratch Assessment Strategies Purpose of assessment? 1. Know what someone is able to do 2. Feedback about what was learned. 3. Understanding knowledge kids are using 4. Judgment about performance 5. A way of seeing how well teacher’s teach and students learn 6. Demonstration of knowledge or skills 7. Giving learners an opportunity to make learning visible Challenges of assessment 1. What does it mean to assess Scratch? 2. How to evaluate a project in a rigorous manner? 3. What would the rubric look like? 4. Two approaches to assessment: a. Looking at an artifact and understanding the process b. Having students explaining their own process and arrival at final result c. How to do this in Scratch? 5. How to separate the task and creative process from the assessment? 6. What standards are being met through a project? 7. Assessment related to medium vs. assessment related to message. What does it mean to assess Scratch projects or computer science projects in general? Strategies for assessment 1. Tie projects into “Habits of Mind” standards 2. Scratch rubric example: http://scratched.media.mit.edu/resources/rubric-assessing-scratch-projects-draft-0 3. Ramapo School district rubric: https://docs.google.com/file/d/14bbr5_UQNeWHpSi9ni1PK6qZmF3OmfyZGkeslX0XsIw/edit?usp=drive_web&pli=1 4. ScratchEd curriculum guide: http://scratched.media.mit.edu/resources/scratch-curriculum-guide-draft 5. Prioritize teacher communities to discuss assessment to deepen understanding of computer science skills. 6. Use examples of projects for typical levels of understanding for comparison 7. Columns: “I need to learn how to use this” “I can use this” “I can teach someone else how to use this” to assess what students know. 8. Importance of students documenting their project in assessment. https://int.erlace.com/ - collaborative documentation where students can post problems, questions, screenshots, solutions, etc. relating to their Scratch projects 9.

Recap Introductions and Goals - After morning networking over coffee and donuts, participants sat in a circle and introduced themselves and their goals for attending the meetup. Breakout Sessions - Karen facilitated an activity to help the group form the agenda for the day. Each person wrote four breakout session ideas on sticky notes and then arranged them on the wall with similar ideas. Four, 40-minute sessions got the highest vote. Ingrid led a session to come up with introductory Scratch project ideas, Helen and Josh asked for feedback on the Scratch Hour of Code prototype activity, Derek and others talked about next steps for students in a breakout session titled, ""Life After Scratch"", and Karen led a discussion of Scratch assessment strategies. Announcements - Lunch from Chipotle followed with a group brainstorm of announcements, ideas, and resources.

I contacted No starch, who said they do not troubles shoot or apparently offer any customer assistance but to ask here. If any one could help we would certainly appreciate it.

The facilitators then invited attendees to introduce themselves to one another by sharing their name, association, goals for the meetup, and holiday plans. Scheduling and Breakout Sessions - To generate the agenda for the day, participants were asked to write two breakout session ideas on sticky notes, which were then grouped on the wall by similar topic. Three session ideas emerged. First, Karen helped to organize small group discussions for people to share Hour of Code plans. Next, a group of educators gathered to talk about advanced topics with Scratch, while others continued to work on Hour of Code and other activity ideas.

The answers to the exercises will generally be one or more blocks of Scratch code. Ideally I would like something like the backpack, but in a more flexible format. Ideally I'd like to create a problem set ""document"", and students would read the problems in the document, solve the problems using Scratch, and then drag the code block(s) used in the solution (which would generally be blocks of script for a single sprite) *into* the document. Then the teacher could review the solutions, and also the kids could use their prior solutions by dragging code back out of the document when they are working on future exercises. My understanding is that the only way I could do something like this with the Scratch infrastructure as it stands is perhaps to have the students set up a studio and create a Scratch project in the studio for each exercise in the problem set. Or for very short exercises they could put the answers to several exercises in a single Scratch project. My fallback alternative is to create the problem set as a google doc, and as students complete the exercises they would take screen shots of the Scratch screen showing the code blocks, and paste these screen shots into the doc (which is shared with the teacher). That's pretty ugly, but it would work. I'm just wondering if others have come up with a better solution for this type of thing. From my review of the existing topics in this discussion, I didn't see anything."24712	scratch on chromebook	1/2/14 4:29	"I am planning to teach Scratch in a class where most students are on Chromebooks.

This was the first time many of our students used Scratch, and they all picked up on it very well! I designed a tiger for them to use with the program because our school mascot is a tiger, and the book centers around a stuffed animal bunny.

Recap Networking and Introductions - The day started with networking over Starbucks and delicious Flour pastries. We then gathered together to share new year's resolutions and goals for 2014 -- including Scratch and beyond. Scheduling and Breakout Sessions - The schedule for the day was created collectively using sticky notes. Each person contributed two breakout session ideas, which were then grouped together by Colin and Barbara to divide the space and time. Six sessions were proposed: Janet organized a session introducing Scratch and physical world connections where people played with MaKeyMaKey kits, Derek started a discussion to share curriculum ideas, Rosemary and Audra hosted an introductory Scratch session, Colin and Karen facilitated a session for hands-on Scratch projects, Barbara led a session about going beyond the basics of Scratch, and Lorraine hosted an idea-share for classroom management strategies. Lunch and Announcements - After breakout sessions, Chipotle lunch was followed by lively conversation with friends from the App Inventor team, ending with announcements of upcoming events. Photos - More photos from the meetup can be viewed on Flickr.

Karen and Michelle framed the introductory session around the prompt: ""What questions have you brought to the meetup?"". Scheduling Sessions - Derek, Ingrid, Janet, and LeeAnn volunteered to organize the agenda based on ideas shared by participants on sticky notes. The final schedule comprised of six sessions held over two forty-minute blocks. Breakout Sessions - During the first group of breakout sessions, Rosemary facilitated a hands-on introductory Scratch session, while Janet led a discussion around professional development and Derek hosted an interactive session to ideate next steps for intermediate and advanced Scratch users (thanks Ingrid for taking and sharing notes of the discussion!). After 40 minutes, we switched to the second set of sessions, starting with Steve and Rory hosting a conversation about assessment and standards, Ingrid sharing some of her favorite ideas for integrating Scratch with other subjects, and LeeAnn gathering with other educators to come up with new Scratch project ideas. Meetup Message Board - After two rounds of breakout sessions, we gathered all together one last time for delicious DIY Chipotle lunch and to share announcements using a meetup message board -- plus a surprise demo from Louisa!.

(I have previously used Scratch+WeDo on Windows, but I'm hoping to start using Linux so that I can re-purpose old computers, plus encourage more educators and parents to try Linux with kids.) BUT...I am having trouble, I think, getting the LEGO WeDo USB connection to be recognized consistently through Linux. I have recently obtained a Raspberry Pi, which came with a Raspbian distro (Debian Wheezy) , and the included Scratch 1.4 version worked right away with the WeDo USB connection. Yay! However, not so much luck with another version of Linux on some laptops that I tried. Boo. As you may know, in Scratch, there are some special functions (program blocks) that interact with the WeDo motor and sensors through the special WeDo USB hub. The documentation that I can find says that Scratch will show these special function blocks only when the WeDo USB hub is active/recognized. (One can force-display the blocks through a menu option, but that doesn't necessarily mean they'll work). I installed the Ubermix (Ubuntu) distro on 2 old-ish Dell Latitude D610's, and the WeDo USB connection does NOT seem to be working/recognized on either laptop. (The special blocks do not appear in Scratch 1.4, nor does any sensor or motor work, even if I make the blocks appear by using the menu, then put them in a program. And yes, I tried both motor and sensors, & all of the USB ports.) Anyone got clues to help me? Maybe I should just try another kid-friendly distro? (Anyone tried Edubuntu or DoudouLinux?) I figure it's  USB drivers or hardware config or permissions or something, but I am NOT at all an expert with Linux and I don't have that much time. I can edit config files, etc, if I have instructions. I also have a few Linux-loving friends who I can call upon if needed, but I'd like to have first done whatever research I can. (*see below)  Also, I cannot really ?advocate ?for other teachers to try this if it's not fairly easy. but if there is a fairly simple fix, I'd be happy to help make sure it gets spread around. I do have a deadline of sorts -- trying to have this working for demos at a Maker Faire in May 2014.

Recap Who are you? Why are you here? - Following morning networking over coffee and Flour pastries, attendees introduced themselves to one another answering the following questions: What's your name? Where are you from? What do you do? What are you here for? Agenda Co-Creating - The participants were challenged to co-create the schedule for the day by first, brainstorming session ideas on stickies in small groups, and then collectively grouping similar topics together on the wall. After a few minutes, we had our agenda for the day -- in record time! Breakout Sessions - Two sets of 35-minute breakout sessions took place at the meetup. During the first set of sessions, Sean led an hands-on introduction to Scratch while Christan facilitated a discussion around activities and projects. Abdulrahman took a small group downstairs to the Lifelong Kindergarten group's lab space to demonstrate ways to connect Scratch with hardware. In the second set of sessions, Derek led a small group discussion around outreach while Sean hosted a session  to talk about hackathon and afterschool Scratch club ideas. Meanwhile, in the couch area, Barbara organized a conversation about Scratch curricular connections to standards. Lunch Discussions - Over lunch, we took down suggestions from the whole group for possible Scratch PD opportunities, Michelle shared an update on ScratchJr, and Lyre talked about Mozilla Webmaker. Other announcements and resources are listed below. Photos - Pictures from the event are available on Flickr.

For now, here is one issue: This is a drawing project with a finger and Leap Motion. We are using the offline Scratch 2.0 editor. It draws and draws and then all of a sudden, it starts making sharp straight lines when you move the finger instead of what the finger is doing. We are baffled. Has anyone else had a similar experience? One of my students figured out that a hand keeps a connection with the Leap Motion better than a finger but in another game being built, two fingers work to move two characters in a game but two hands cause confusion as they overlap too easily."26955	Oragnize my Project space	4/29/14 20:04	"Any ideas on how to organize My Project area under My Stuff?

Recap Introductions and a Question - After informal networking with coffee and Flour pastries, everyone gathered in a circle for introductions. Michelle invited each person to share a brief introduction, and then asked to answer the following question: ""What is one thing you are looking forward to doing in May?"" Co-Creating the Schedule - Attendees generated session ideas on small stickies in small groups of three, then we thematically clustered the stickies on the wall to see which topics people were most interested in exploring during breakout sessions. Breakout Sessions - Four different breakout sessions emerged. Many participants new to Scratch were interested in having an introductory session, which Rosemary volunteered to organize around building up a maze project. Lorraine hosted a show & tell to share recent student work and Adam facilitated a discussion on supporting intermediate Scratchers. Lunch - During lunch, Michelle shared upcoming events, Lucia presented her work from a university course in Mexico City using Scratch, and Lynn demonstrated how she uses Edmodo to manager her Scratch curriculum.

I would very much like to use it for my community college electronics technology students who are learning programming down at the hardware level with Arduino or bare microcontrollers (e.g. AVR, PIC). Unfortunately, most are not programmers, having chosen electronics over programming because they prefer working with hardware. In other courses, they learn Karel for Fanuc industrial robots and ladder logic. They are not computer science majors, nor do they aspire to be. They do like to make things work, though. I would like to introduce programming concepts with Scratch. That looks easy enough thanks to all the resources out there. I will also introduce them to Scratch for Arduino (s4a.cat) But it's the next step that puzzles me: how to transition to ""production"" O-O programming languages like Python and C++? The way I see it, the conventional O-O paradigm works fine for each object if you treat sprites as objects (cloning sprites is similar to instantiating objects of a class). However, it's not so obvious for messages, events and concurrent execution of sprites (objects). For example, interrupts are events, so Scratch is helpful to introduce the concept of an interrupt service routine (handler) that runs asynchronously. However, broadcasting messages between objects (tasks?) typically requires some OS support. Any ideas? Are there any resources to map Scratch concepts to conventional O-O programming? Thanks"27223	Integrating language and arts with MIT scratch programming	5/14/14 5:05	"For surviving in 21st century, one needs to think critically and creatively, embrace diversity and tolerate ambiguity, create as well as consume information. Many of these skills can be developed through the innovative use of computers in art subjects like drawing, painting, music etc. and natural language.  Arts education promotes work habits that cultivate curiosity, imagination, creativity and communication skills.  Students who possess these skills are better able to tolerate and tackle ambiguity, explore new realms of possibility, express their own thoughts and feelings and understand the perspective of others.  Students’ capacity to create and express themselves through arts is one of the central qualities that make the human, as well as a basis for success in the 21st century.  But the new technologies have been largely absent in art education at school level.  The current education curriculum focuses on fairly latest but, difficult to understand category of programming languages.  So am trying to make a research paper on  how the language and arts can be integrated using MIT’s Scratch environment? is that possible."27224	Language and Arts	5/14/14 5:15	How to integrate language and arts with MIT scratch programming?27225	Computational thinking	5/14/14 5:19	How scratch programming Provides Computational thinking skills?27230	Cloud variables	5/14/14 8:24	what is the use of cloud variables in scratch 2.0 in detail27306	ScratchEd Weekly Roundup | 05/10/14 - 05/16/14	5/16/14 19:00	"The weekly roundup is where the ScratchEd Team shares some of the major -- as well as some of the overlooked -- news, stories, and events related to Scratch that took place throughout the week.

Methodology: 1.     To establish a platform by which the children can hangout with one another. This may be something like a Google+ hangout or some other reliable, safe and free type of platform. 2.     To establish a group of teacher-mentors in their own specialties who will be willing to guide the children in the different aspects of making a book from scratch. : ) (no pun intended) Note: In view of the long hours that teachers work, there will probably be three or four teacher per group of students so that at any one time, a teacher-mentor can make it to the hangout. 3.     To develop a MOOC on how to publish a book. This is not to be intensive but encouraging, explaining the process of making a book from A to Z. This will mean that industry specialists who may not be Scratchers will have to be called in to talk to the students during the MOOC. To encourage the children, perhaps those who participate may be given some certificate at the end of the MOOC which will show that they have learned how to make a book (in theory) or some other form of motivational reward. 4. To create a website for this project under the same principle of a group of teacher-mentors to a group of interested students. 5. To develop a sign-up page for students to sign up for the various groups, for example, writers, illustrators, proofreaders, editors, publishers, marketing, communication, Scratch debuggers, translators, website managers and so on. 6. When the project is completed, to create an awareness website for the advertisement of this book and the books to come. This will be also run by students  with teacher-mentors. This website will provide links to Scratch, ScratchJr, ScratchEd and other interesting educational website suggested by our Scratchers. 7. When enough books have been published, a number to be agreed on by the BBS Encouragement Committee, to run an annual contest funded by Kickstarter to award the top 3 books published per year. What do you think of this Big Idea? : )"27554	ScratchEd Weekly Roundup | 05/24/14 - 05/30/14	5/30/14 18:10	"The weekly roundup is where the ScratchEd Team shares some of the major -- as well as some of the overlooked -- news, stories, and events related to Scratch that took place throughout the week.

Next, Michelle facilitated a speed networking activity in the hallway. Schedule Co-Creation - After getting to know one another in the networking activity, participants came up with breakout session topics and wrote their ideas on small sticky notes. Common interests emerged and were clustered together to form the agenda for the day. Breakout Session 1 - During the first set of breakout groups, Karen facilitated an introductory hands-on Scratch session, Rosemary and Janet worked with a group of educators interested in designing Scratch popcorn-maker projects using advanced Scratch concepts, and Ingrid led a discussion about integrating Scratch across different curricular disciplines. Breakout Session 2 - In the next round of sessions, Michelle hosted a session to explore some of the new features in Scratch 2.0, LeeAnn organized a group to share Scratch activity and challenge ideas (thanks for the notes, Ingrid!), and Rosemary and Christan started a discussion about designing Scratch lesson plans and sequences. Show & Tell - During lunch, Priya presented an example from her third graders' water cyle Scratch project, Saundra demoed student projects from her 6 grade Digital Citizenship and Literacy class studio, and Ingrid shared about her students using Scratch with MaKey MaKey to create simulations of ecosystems and prey-predator relationships using cloning.

New to Scratch-Teacher Attempting to Teach Programming as Part of Main Curriculum in My Math Classes This Year	7/29/14 20:34	"Good afternoon, My name is Dillon Daniel-Hoffman and I'm so excited to begin something bold this fall. Starting in Septemer (late August really with inservice week) I will attempt to do something completely different in class. I have taught for three years now, all at this great public charter high school in Oregon called Oregon City Service Learning Academy. It is a school that sort of functions as the de-facto alternative high school for the district, and our approximately 180 students have largely been kicked around and given up on in their past academic and personal environments. They come often with high anxiety and with gaps in their academic and functional knowledge and skills. Because we are a public charter school, as the school's advanced math teacher, I am mandated to follow the state (and now Common Core) standards and attempt to teach my students the same Algebra, Geometry, Statistics and Probability, and Trig concepts that any other school would (we don't get up through Calculus, at least we haven't yet). I have a wonderful relationship with my students, many of which I will have for at least two full years while they are at our school, but helping them through the standardized mathematics curriculum is a nightmare. Every day is a battle to try to get past their apathy and disinterest, their anxiety and fear of the subject that has been generated by years of feeling inadequate and failing and/or having a traumatic experience with a teacher or with the material. I am often the third teacher they've had try to explain solving an equation or how to graph something on an x-y coordinate plane. My students are burned out with school in general, but especially with math. And yet, for the last three years, I have done what I was told to. I got them through as much material as I could. Most of them passed. They thanked me and then they were done. And the whole time, when I zoomed out, I felt horrible. Like I was living a lie. It's 2014! Why am I forced to teach students the pythagorean theorem and algebraic equations and not something applicable like game design or computer programming! Kids are developing apps at early ages and becoming millionaries, while my students are learning concepts they'll almost instantly forget and never use again! Especially because they are almost all not four year college bound. And the worst part? Since we got a SIG (School Improvement Grant) a few years ago, we replaced textbooks with laptops! We have a wonderful innovative site for math that I've used for two years now (corefocusonmath.com), but it's just a 21st century tool used to teach centuries old curriculum! These laptops should be used for something better...something, applicable... It was at a conference in May that I heard about Scratch. The dream became a plan. And that's where I'm at now. My principal is on board. Next year, I will attempt to do something different. I will alternate between the Common Core Standardized Mathematics that I'm forced to teach, and the computer programming skills that my students need (and will probably want) to learn. At least...that is the plan. Because here's the immensely scary part: I have never done this before. I took a couple of programming classes in college, but those were awful and burned me out with computer programming without giving me the knowledge and confidence necessary to do it, much less teach it. So, in the next month I'm diving in and trying to figure this out. I'm excited and scared and hopeful. Can I get 180 or so students signed up for this site? Will it work? What is the progression of stuff that I teach them when we're starting out? And how do I best go about this? Will this just fail miserably, or will it become a model that hopefully many schools like mine and in general could follow? So many questions, and any insight would be greatly appreciated. The journey begins now. Thank you so much for reading this and sharing anything that you might feel inclined to share."28380	Notebook	8/3/14 15:20	"I teach primarily 10-12 grade students. Last year for about the last 6 weeks of school, I started my students on Scratch. This year, I will be teaching Game Design. I noticed in the curriculum it suggests the usage of a Notebook for students. Was wondering how others have used the Notebook as part of the curriculum? I know in the old days, I used to do flowcharts but, something tells me that there is more efficient use of notebooks than flowcharts. I also know, that my students had problems with forever and If then blocks as well as nested loops."28381	ScratchEd Weekly Roundup | 07/26/14 - 08/01/14	8/3/14 16:57	"The weekly roundup is where the ScratchEd Team shares some of the major -- as well as some of the overlooked -- news, stories, and events related to Scratch that took place throughout the week.

If they match they disappear, if not they flip back. I can get the game to work easily enough in both Snap and Scratch with a separate sprite for each card. Obviously, this creates  a lot of repetitive code. I'm wandering how I might tackle the task using only one sprite for all the cards. Is it possible to approach it thorugh cloning? If so, how do I reference each particular clone to check for a match.

So one of the goals is to use this opportunity to help students prepare for those moments whilst making it fun through Scratch.

We've a range of support material on the Citizen Maths ""Information Hub"" at http://info.citizenmaths.com/, including a 4 page overview of the thinking behind the course. Citizen Maths is “for anyone who can make good use of it”, and we strongly welcome feedback about it from all categories of user. We’ve designed it with independent learners in mind: that is, for people who are not enrolled on a formal course and who want to improve their maths. But we also expect that some teachers, tutors or trainers, will find that Citizen Maths is a useful adjunct to their own work, and that they will give their students active encouragement to use Citizen Maths too. It may also be that parents of school-aged children decide to use Citizen Maths to develop their own maths so that they can help their children.

We're huge fans of Scratch, and are running a number of Scratch programming classes this fall. We're currently working on an educational software tool called BlocksCAD, a drag-and-drop 3D CAD and modeling tool designed for elementary schoolers, partly inspired by the success we've seen kids have with Scratch. We've already had great success teaching math and programming skills to elementary students in grades 3 and above, while motivating them with the ability to design 3D printable objects. We want to make it freely available so kids will be able to use it in the classroom or at home. To that end, we recently launched a Kickstarter campaign to fund open sourcing BlocksCAD and further development. Here is a link to our page: http://www.einsteinsworkshop.com/blockscad We'd love to get feedback from the Scratch community, and are looking for ways to help spread the word.

However, I am not a teacher.  Although I have some ideas on what to teach the kids, I am hoping to find a curriculum or a workshop lesson plan here.  For example, in a 1-2 hours workshop, what's the best way to pique their interest so perhaps they can continue on their own later on?  Is it better to just ""teach"" the whole time, or should the kids be given an assignment to create a very basic program?  The class (of 25) does have 9 iPads at all time, and I have a feeling I can borrow some more from the other classrooms if I have to, or they can take turns. Any suggestion or recommendation (lesson plans will be even better!!) will be really appreciated!  If the kids enjoy it, I may even ask the teacher to let me make this a recurring class that I teach (perhaps once every month or every two months) since I know the school loves anything STEM.

We met in the brand new Makerspace and spacious adjoining rooms. We kicked off the day with informal networking over coffee, bagels and fruit.  Sue Cusack of the Lesley University/Kennedy-Longfellow Tech Project welcomed us to the space. Who are you? : Each attendee filled out a “who am I” poster with a self-portrait and three things about themselves. These were posted to a wall for all to see.  We then organized into lines and did 3 minute one-on-one introductions with people we hadn’t met. Agenda co-creating: The participants were challenged to co-create the schedule for the day by first, brainstorming ideas on idea stickies in small groups.  Ingrid and Janet then rapidly grouped all the ideas and came up with our session topics for the day. Breakout Sessions: We had time for two 45 minute sessions with three topics in each.  Rosemary led a game project for those interested in getting started with Scratch.  Another group met around Math and Science ideas for Scratch and used Muazzez’s project  to look into how we can implement tallies using a counting variable. A third group worked with the WeDo kits building their own chain reaction based on the Scratch + Lego WeDo Chain Reaction video. Lunch Discussion: Ingrid shared the Creative Computing Curriculum Website. Janet shared some resources on ScratchEd including the Student Handbook for Scratch and ECS. Adam shared a WeDo demonstration from his breakout session. Announcements and Resources: Our Google+ Community is launched.

I begin the lesson by demonstrating important elements of the build, then pass out the bulidsheets, and my students build the projects individually.  After students have successfully built a working version of the project, they work to customize it, making it their own. My students' enthusiasm for programming is overwhelming.  They cheer when I announce a build is scheduled; they push through challenging work, so they can earn time to improve their projects.  It is, quite simply, the best thing that's ever happened to my teaching, and I'm eager to share these little modelers with anyone who'll take the time to look at them. The e-book is nearly done; I'm just doing the page layouts for the final few projects.  I will publish the books for free under a creative commons license, and I'd also like to produce a series of build screencasts, that are similar to the lessons I deliver to my students.  Anyone can access the e-book here: http://goo.gl/pHF6Hd This year's class has built the first four projects so far; here are some student examples: Thousand Modeler: http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/26165870/ Multiple Thousands Modeler: http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/26522183/ Money Clicker: http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/26890050/ Digit Dotter: http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/28295704 If you have any questions or comments, or you end up using these in your classroom, I'd love to hear from you.

We have created a free web tool to automatically analyze Scratch projects that we have called Dr. Scratch. This tool will allow your students to improve their programming skills by identifying areas that they could explore further and by detecting possible issues in their programs . On the one hand, by just uplading a Scratch project to Dr. Scratch, it will give you information about the development of Computational Thinking in terms of abstraction, logical thinking, synchronization, parallelization, flow control, user interactivity and data representation. In the same vein, by uploading a Scratch project to Dr. Scratch, you will receive feedback that could help you to improve your programs, as the tool detects several issues like code that is never executed (dead code), repeated code, objetcs with default names or sprites attiributes, like position or size, that may be modified but not correctly initialized. Dr. Scratch is free open source software, which is being developed by a team of teachers, developers and researchers at the Universidad Rey Juan Carlos, Spain. We have plenty of ideas for keep on improving Dr. Scratch (like creating teachers accounts so educators can easily analyze their students projects), and we look enthusiastically forward to Scratchers’ comments, suggestions, and feedback, either here in the ScratchED forum, by email (drscratch@programamos.es) or by Twitter (@drscratchtool). Dr. Scratch is available at http://drscratch.programamos.es I hope you guys enjoy it!

Thanks to the PDF cards, I managed to show them various ways of using Scratch, yet I have met a lot of annoying troubles and I doubt I am the only one. So here is a list of met troubles. I'm using Firefox 35xx under Windows 7 if anyone cares to know :) But when I made some attempts with Internet Explorer, I also met the same problems. - Clicking a sprite with the right button has no effect at all, no popping menu shows. - Unfortunately when this happens, the ""copy"" or ""delete"" buttons on top of screen do not react at all either. - When resizing a sprite, its moves seems a bit erratic as if the original size was still being used... As a consequence when going up and then right, for instance, the sprite seems to jump suddenly . - Sometimes the sprite goes off screen, while it (hopefully) still appears at the bottom of the screen. Yet I cannot bring it back on screen, all I can do is delete it with a right click. - Sometimes when I insert a second sprite, it won't move at all nor even appear on screen. - I still miss a button that would bring the sprite back to its initial position (also cancel moves, rotations and special effects all at once) That's quite enough for a start, I really hope someone can help me out since I'm wasting a lot of time trying to get things to work properly.

I've had the conversation with my students often about giving credit for ideas they use online. I have one student that added a project to our class studio that is identical to a really popular featured program created by another user. The program is called ""Neon Ride"". The student of mine is claiming credit for it - that he made it under a different account a while ago, and moved it. There are some things going on in the comments of these programs that I'm not comfortable with, and I need to put a stop to it when I see the kids next week. My student's project: http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/48612296/ The other, more popular project: http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/30133706/ In a nutshell, a couple of users are using the comments to accuse my student of copying the program without remixing, and my student is using the comments to accuse the other user of copying. There is a little name-calling as well. After all of the discussions we've had in class about proper etiquette and plagiarism, I don't feel like I can just ignore it. Some of the comments are visible in the studio I set up for the kids to share their programs. I was wondering how you would handle this as a teacher, or if referring it to Scratch administrators is a more proper thing to do?

Julian Aptowitz Michelle Chung Michael Condor Maria DeCicco Susan Fisher Ingrid Gustafson Nicole Hart Kathleen Martell Dan Monahan Natalie Paine Adam Scharfenberger Richard Smyth Sarita Spillert Bradley Staeben Barbara Tennyson Recap Part 1: Networking & Scheduling - We started off our Saturday morning with bagels, beverages, and fruit. The group circled up and everyone introduced themselves by answering questions: What's your name? Where are you from? What do you do? What is one thing/project, inside or outside of your day job, that you are proud of this year? Next, attendees wrote one or two ideas for session topics on post-it notes which were then gathered on the whiteboard. Adam and Ingrid helped group together the sessions into a total of three sessions instead of the usual four. Part 2: Exploring & Learning - Our group had two 45 minute blocks to fill with sessions. In the first block, there were two sessions: Introduction to Scratch and Teaching with Scratch. In the second block, there was a large interest in exploring extensions with Scratch as well as some of the other technology tools in the Kennedy-Longfellow Makerspace, so we created on session called Extensions. Part 3: Sharing & Reflecting - Keeping in the spirit of the Makerspace, we each made our own DIY deli sandwhiches at lunch time with a side of chips, veggies, and salad. During the Show & Tell we had three participants share their projects. Mike Condor shared how he uses Scratch to create designs that he then prints using a laser wood cutter. Richard shared a creative animation he worked on incorporating images and music. Dan shared a particle simluator he created using Scratch. As final words for the meetup, we went around the room and shared one thing we learned and if we achieved our goals for the day.

Attendees: Steven Connelly Janet Dee Ingrid Gustafson Nicole Hart Bobbi Kezirian Lorraine Leo Natalie Paine Ivan Rudnicki Adam Scharfenberger Rosemary Slattery Richard Smyth Daniel Watt Recap: Part 1: Networking and Scheduling: After an informal gathering around our “food table” with coffee, juice, fruit, blueberry cake and Smartfood (delicious anytime!), we introduced ourselves and shared one challenge that we had coming up in the near future around Scratch. Ivan offered his challenge to integrate Scratch into a K-8 curriculum at three Boston charter schools and Nicole shared her challenge to use Scratch in ninth grade math class learning linear equations.  For our first session, we decided to form groups around these two very different topics. Part 2: Collaborating and Generating Ideas In the K-8 curriculum discussion, we brainstormed teacher PD strategies, inquiry learning strategies and workflow for elementary students.  For PD, the group recommended providing strategies for cooperative learning such as “ask 3 and then ask me,” pair programming, assigning roles to students in team projects, and gallery walks. We also talked about the need to implement grade level appropriate computational literacies which can be found in the national CSTA standards. Other resources that were suggested were: ScratchEd website, Creative Computing Curriculum, and CCOW (for PD ideas). In the learning linear equations group, they brainstormed general math applications for Scratch with the intent to find a way to incorporate linear equations. Nicole had a specific idea which was to use the scenario of Lebron James dunking a basketball. Part 3: Our Mini Hackathon For the second session both groups took on the challenge of creating a Scratch project with a basketball theme to demonstrate linear equations. Janet added the challenge to use pair programming as an experience. Five teams accepted the challenge and worked for 45 minutes. During lunch every team shared their solutions. Here are two solutions that were shared on Scratch: Simple slope and intercept: http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/51239584/ Slope-2: http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/51238036/ Everyone agreed that the simple slope and intercept project with one sprite and 7 lines of code would be great for Nicole’s lesson (although it still needs Lebron and a hoop). Dan also shared an example of a simple function machine in Scratch that requires the player to guess the function based on the inputs and outputs.

I am a teacher in training and volunteer to help at a middle school montessori math class. The math teacher who I help gave me  a day (one fifty minute class) to introduce scratch to his students. I really want them to make some small program that they think is neat and is show-offable to the class near the end of the period. The goal is to get them interested in programming. None of them have any programming experience nor have they ever heard of scratch before. However I don't want to spend fifty minutes walking them through all of the cool things they can do with scratch because I want them to use the majority of the time discovering/creating their own thing. Ideally I'd like to give the class a 5 to 10 minute introduction to the interface of scratch and then let them have at it.  Does anyone have any suggestions on what I should go over in that 5 to 10 minute intro in order to maximize both what they can do and the time they have to work with?

Course Description In this course, you will use Scratch to create an original video game with custom graphics, sound effects and music. You will begin by remixing an existing game, gradually gaining design skills and confidence. When you are ready to develop a whole new game, you will learn how to focus your ideas, integrate player feedback and refine your 2D game before sharing it with the world. No prior computer programming experience is required. Working for i2 Camp i2 Camp is a hands-on, project-based STEM summer day camp designed to broaden middle school students’ exposure to innovative science, technology, engineering and math. The co-ed camp has developed its program by partnering with some of the world’s leading scientific and academic institutions, including MIT, The Museum of Science in Boston, Stanford University, MathWorks, the New York Academy of Sciences and Teachers College, Columbia University. Teachers will be trained by i2 Camp’s curriculum partners to understand the curriculum and the activities planned for each course. Courses will be focused on hands-on learning and will therefore be limited to a maximum of 20 children, with up to three instructors in each course, including a lead teacher, an associate teacher and a high school student acting as a “near peer.” Lead teachers will be responsible for overseeing this team of instructors. Lead Teachers– Must have previous K-12 school teaching experience and an interest in project-based learning. Associate Teachers– Must have or be working toward a degree in a STEM field or in K-12 STEM education. Previous classroom experience is a plus. The camp will run in each location Monday – Friday, and teachers must be at the camp from 8:30am – 4:30pm every day. Children of teachers who enroll in the camp will be given a discount to attend the camp. Lunch will be served each day. Salary varies by location and will be discussed during the interview process.

The Scratch Ed Meetup Guide was extremely helpful in organizing our event.  Thank you Scratch Ed team for putting together a fantastic resource! We had 26 attendees including teachers, school administrators, college professors and community partners. After a brief welcome, we began the morning with a overview of what a meetup is and how it is a great way to build and support a community of Scratch Educators in Kentucky.  Keeping in the unconference format, participants wrote two things they wanted to learn, disuss or share while at the meetup for building our sessions.  We completed the ""Meet Up with"" activity from the Scratch Ed Meetup Guide and then broke off into interest groups.  Since this was our first meetup, we had three session: Beginning Scratch, Elementary Integration Ideas and Middle/High Integration Ideas.  Groups met for an hour, with great discussion on everything from ways to introduce Scratch to students to connecting Scratch to content standards. We wrapped up our morning with a great lunch sponsered by our Kentucky Society for Technology Education (KySTE) and conversations of future meetups.

I write to you because as you are I'm a computer enginering working full time with education. I'm responsabile to evaluate and propose solutions with all sort of solutions that involves technology. I am interested in building a relationship with you so eventually we may work together with shared values, I like that you belief that the key to development of human resources lies in universal education and gender equality. When equipped with knowledge, skills and ambition, children can grow up to live happy, empowered lives, and be valuable members of their society. First I would like to introduce our concept: We are a non-profit organisation striving to empower the world’s poorest individuals through advancing educational opportunities. We work on the expansion of education by providing a new approach to the content and delivery of the learning experience, giving knowledge to the less privileged with no previous means of accessing the opportunities now available in the digital age. We are puttind a lesson plan together to use scratch on this platform on which the tools of learning will empower people with the technical language of the future, so we may globalise communication in the digital era. Connecting people in the remotest of places with a universal language will not only change lives through impact but change the meaning of equal opportunities. Our mission is to educate children in coding and design concepts by engaging them in cutting-edge technology, like Raspberry Pi, with inspiring projects that are fun and productive; Building games of their own designs with javascript, HTML CSS and python. We aim to make this learning model a part of the school curriculum to give children the chance in developing countries to work on a universally recognised skill, building their confidence in developing themselves and broadening their career prospects worldwide. We want to build lasting relationships with local communities and encourage everyone’s engagement in the program. An allocated teacher will be provided for the leading and supervision of the learning development of our students. Our continual support will see that individual learning needs are met and that graduates are given the tools they require to utilise their skills as they grow. Current education in technology development has discovered a huge weakness that has inhibited the ability to actually understand the concept of how it works. Graduates understand how to use technology but not how to build it; coding is the key in advancing both technology as we know it and the people using it. The ever growing needs of the employment market can be met by those with the skill set to take it one step further. This is what we offer. There is a significant difference between consuming information and being confident to develop it. Imagine speaking the same language; code, this could be the first step to creating global equality, in terms of opportunity. Regardless of where you are, we get you where you want to be. I request the opportunity to communicate directly with you so we can further discuss the processes that are under way with regards to both the business model and applied funding. I would also like to explore how we may potentiate a partnership.

Of the kids who reported that they had ""a lot"" of prior experience with Scratch, 92% ""definitely"" agreed with the statement ""I can use computers to make things.""  Only 13% of the kids who reported no or little prior experience with Scratch felt this way.  (More data at http://www.jasoninnes.com/?p=150) Of course, we can't say that Scratch caused the kids to feel this way.  But in the minds of these 5th graders at least Scratch is strongly associated with a view of computers as creative tools.  This finding really made me happy and I just thought I'd share! Does anyone have any experience with or pointers to attitudinal surveys or other instruments specifically designed to gauge kids' feelings about creativity and computers?  (We will be conducting more assessments -- at least a final post-assessment -- so we could definitely use some ideas for improvements to the surveys.)"34153	TechsCool hiring summer Interns	5/6/15 13:16	"Looking for experienced teachers/ coders in Orange County for summer coding classes.

Part 2: Play Time: As a group we decided to continue the conversations and explorations that people had already started. Janet and Mike worked on strategies for learning Scratch in order to teach it to HS students. Steve tried the 12 block challenge from the Scratch Day agenda and then worked on a maze with Michael and Ivan. They had a great discussion around ways to keep sprites from going through maze walls. Alina shared the ECS curriculum and some starter projects with Andrea and Jing.  Andrea’s sons built with the Little Bits blocks, inspiring Colin and Sandra to try out the Scratch Extension for Little Bits after a discussion on FabLabs. Andrea and Ingrid talked about the Creative Computing Curriculum Guide, the local chapter of the CSTA as a resource for getting involved with computer science education, as well as the Raspberry Pi and how it can be used in a variety of settings to help learn computer programming. Part 3: Lunch and Sharing: At lunch we were joined by representatives of the Kentucky Meetup team: Kelly, Brittany and Gayla. They came over from the MIT Scratch Day event to visit us. Then Andrea’s sons demonstrated the elaborate Little Bits chain they had built in two hours.  We were all impressed with how much they had learned since they had never seen the Little Bits before.  Janet shared CyberParra’s hunt game as an example of lists and Ivan suggested using the same strategy to make a Snake game.  Andrea’s 12 year old son shared his Scratch maze that he had made for a class project. Snif Snif, Hound will find you by CyberParra: https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/55222314/ Bee-Bot Simulator by Ivan: https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/61353618/ Our next meetup is scheduled for Saturday, June 6, 2015.  This will be our last meetup for this school year so please mark your calendar, sign up and join us at the Kennedy-Longfellow School in Cambridge."34282	Thoughts on Google's CS First?	5/12/15 19:26	"Has anyone had experience with Google's CS First at http://www.cs-first.com? I ask because while I've skimmed the videos and resources, I haven't really had the chance to use it with my kids. We're exclusively using the ScratchED curriculum guide + workbook. My point of view is that CS First seems like a great idea if you want to get non-technical parents to help mentor in the club but may be too restrictive/scripted for very small groups that only need one mentor and that mentor is technical enough. What do others think?"34294	New camera for LEGO robotics that uses Scratch and Snap!	5/13/15 17:44	We have just kickstarted https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/robosnap/robosnap-vision-for-your-robot a new product called RoboSnap that we will be demonstrating at the Scratch Conference in Amsterdam this summer.  This is a camera that is used with the LEGO Mindstorms EV3 or the Rasbperry Pi + BrickPi that you can program with Scratch and Snap!  Here an example of a demo programmed in Snap! https://github.com/10Imaging/RoboSnap/wiki/Snap!-Spider-example.  For more info see www.robosnap.net.34375	How do I record internal sound in Windows 7?	5/18/15 14:39	"I searched for ways to record internal sounds in Windows 7 computers, and I found out that I needed a sound recording driver called ""Stereo Mix"", which Windows 7 does not have.

Would like to ask the community at large how and what exactly do you do to get young girls interested in scratch and programming? Usually, how i approached teaching the kids was to show them examples of games that can be created (e.g. racing games, or 2 person shooting games etc all kid-friendly of course :)). Then I go on to guide them along on how to create their own game variations, and in the process teach them programming and computational thinking concepts. This approach works very well for boys and they are extremely enthusiastic, and pick up quite fast. However, when I try the same approach for girls, I noticed they do not show much interest in this. So.... any ideas? How do you motivate young girls to be interested in programming? Thanks in advance!

This family of tools includes Scratch, Blockly, Code.org's lessons, App Inventor, Snap!, Pencil Code, Alice/Looking Glass, AgentSheets/AgentCubes, etc. They have introduced programming and computational thinking to tens of millions, reaching people of all ages and backgrounds. Despite their popularity, there has been remarkably little research on the usability, effectiveness, or generalizability of affordances from these environments. The goal of this workshop is to begin to distill testable hypotheses from the existing folk knowledge of blocks-based programming environments and identify research questions and partnerships that can legitimize, or discount, pieces of this knowledge. The workshop will bring together educators and researchers with experience in blocks languages, as well as members of the broader VL/HCC community who wish to examine this area more deeply. We seek participants with diverse expertise, including, but not limited to: design of programming environments, instruction with these environments, the learning sciences, data analytics, usability, and more. The workshop will be a generative discussion that sets the stage for future work and collaboration. It will include participant presentations and demonstrations that frame the discussion, followed by reflection on the state of the field and smaller working-group discussion and brainstorming sessions. Suggested Topics for Discussion Who uses blocks programming environments and why? What do they create in these environments, and how satisfied are they with their creations? Which features of blocks environments help or hinder users? How do we know? Which of these features are worth incorporating into more traditional IDEs? What helpful features are missing? How can blocks environments and associated curricular materials be made more accessible to everyone, especially those with disabilities? Can blocks programming appeal to a wider range of interests (e.g., by allowing connections to different types of devices, web services, data sources, etc.)? What are the best ways to introduce programming to novices and to support their progression towards mastery? Do these approaches differ for for learners of computing basics and for makers? What are the conceptual and practical hurdles encountered by novice users of blocks languages when they face the transition to text languages and traditional programming communities? What can be done to reduce these hurdles? How can we best harness online communities to support growth through teaching, motivating, and providing inspiration and feedback? What roles should collaboration play in blocks programming? How can environments support that collaboration? In these environments, what data can be collected, and how can that data be analyzed to determine answers to questions like those above? How can we use data to answer larger scale questions about early experiences with programming? What are the lessons learned (both positive and negative) from creating first programming environments that can be shared with future environment designers? Submission (due 24 Jul 2015) We invite two kinds of submissions: A 1 to 3 page position statement describing an idea or research question related to the design, teaching, or study of blocks programming environments. A paper (up to 6 pages) describing previously unpublished results involving the design, study, or pedagogy of blocks programming environments. All submissions must be made as PDF files to the Easy Chair Blocks and Beyond workshop submission site. Because this workshop will be discussion-based, rather than a mini-conference, the number of presentation/demonstration slots are limited. Authors for whom presentation or demonstration is essential should indicate this in their submission. Important Dates 24 Jul. 2015: Submissions due. 14 Aug. 2015: Author notification. 4 Sep. 2015: Camera ready copies due. 22 Oct. 2015: Workshop in Atlanta. 23 Oct. 2015: Extra day for blocks language developers, researchers, and teachers to interact Workshop Website For more information on the workshop, including a tentative workshop schedule, see the Blocks and Beyond Workshop website.

The mother and school approached me having read that computer science is a suitable knowledge/ skill for the child. I started off with showing the child some simple scratch animations ( e.g. how to make the fish swim in an aquarium), but I'm not sure if I was getting through to him. I do understand autistic kids have different learning capabilities, and have read up as much as I could to prepare myself for the lesson. Does anybody else have such an experience with autistic kids, and have any ideas of what are suitable projects to start them off with? Any help would be much appreciated.

Part of this is due to some updates to Scratch that were made on Wednesday night. In addition, on Thursday morning Scratch experienced a large growth in site traffic due to a number of articles linking to Scratch in the media. While all this attention is great (yay!) we haven't been able to deal with it as well as we would have liked (boo!). Here is what we are doing right now: We have put some small measures into place to help deal with the large influx of traffic We are working on resolving and rolling back some of the changes made on Wednesday night We are working on getting another server into production to help handle the additional load We are very sorry for the trouble that this is causing for many of you and hope to have Scratch back up and running normally soon!

First, they decorated a classroom in a stereotypical way, often associated with computer science, such as Star Trek posters, computer parts and books. Next, they outfitted the room with accessories not associated with computer science, such as plants and art posters. They then showed both photographs to high school girls and boys, asking them which classroom they prefered. They found that girls had a strong preference for the non-stereotypical classroom. Read more here: https://theconversation.com/want-more-girls-to-be-interested-in-computer-science-change-some-classroom-stereotypes-47136 … We're curious to hear from Scratch Educators all over the world: how do you design your classroom environment to welcome diverse learners? In addition to designing the physical space, what else do you do to encourage more diverse images of computer science in your learners' minds?"36818	Developing mathematical thinking with Scratch: an experiment with 6th grade students	9/20/15 11:17	"Hi, Last week at ECTEL 2015 we presented the paper Developing mathematical thinking with Scratch, where we summarized an experiment with 6th grade students from a Colombian school.

Attendees: (with links to ScratchEd user profiles) Cyntia Barzelatto Christine Beltran Sandra Bleecker Dana Cantor Steven Connelly Janet Dee George Daukantas Maria DeCicco Svetlana Grinshpan Raquel Jimenez Lorraine Leo Kathleen Martell Michael McLaughlin Natalie Paine Yoonah Park Wilhelmina Peragine Carmelo Presicce Stephen Richards Soo Jung Roh Maheen Sahoo Adam Scharfenberger Tatiana Shevchenko Rosemary Slattery Richard Smyth Barbara Tennyson Sabita Verma Daniel Watt Recap: Networking and Scheduling:   After an informal gathering around our “food table” with coffee, juice, fruit, and bagels, we introduced ourselves and shared what we were thinking about on our way to the meetup. There was an overwhelming consensus that people were excited about learning more about Scratch as well as learning how educators are using it in their classrooms and other venues. Others were just pleased that it was a beautiful day in Cambridge. All 25 of us then contributed a collection of post-it notes with topic requests. Adam and Barbara accepted the challenge of grouping the notes and created our agenda for the day. Breakout Sessions: Two sets of 45 minute sessions were planned. In the first session we held a Google Hangout with the ScratchEd Meetup concurrently being held in Lexington, KY. (Janet and Leanna had “planned” this ahead of time.)  A big thank you to Maheen for starting the hangout and providing the tech confidence.  We enjoyed hanging out on a Saturday morning with wonderful educators from Kentucky.  Rosemary and Adam led a hands-on introduction to Scratch with a maze project and a pen tool project.  Richard brought his Hangman project for help and inspiration.  The group had great discussions around computer science content. The Scratch projects were very popular and many continued to work on them through the second session.  Carmelo helped Barbara and Willa try out the Little Bits with Scratch. Lorraine led a group looking at ways Scratch can make global connections. Lunch Discussions: The enthusiastic conversations continued over lunch. We shared some projects and announcements (see below). Shout Outs: Our Harvard Interns who joined us today. Carmelo from the MIT Media Lab LLKG for his help with the Little Bits. Leanne Prater and all the educators from Lexington KY for joining us remotely.

To join, use the #ScratchEdChat hashtag or follow the @scratchedteam account, who will be moderating the chat. Totally new to Twitter chats? Learn more below... What is a Twitter chat? Twitter chats are conversations that take place through tweets that are connected through a shared hashtag. Our hashtag will be #ScratchEdChat and our first chat is Wednesday, October 28 at 7pm (Boston time). How can I join? You will need a Twitter account to participate in the chat. To sign up, visit twitter.com. There are several ways to view a chat as it is happening: Go to Twitter.com and type in the hashtag you want to follow (e.g. #ScratchEdChat) in the search bar. You will see a list of every tweet that uses the hashtag, with the most recent tweets at the top. Third-party tools (outside of Twitter) are also available. Tweetdeck (Tweetdeck.com) and Tweetchat (Tweetchat.com) are two options. What should I expect from the Twitter chat? The Twitter chat will start at 7pm (Boston time). The @scratchedteam moderator will start the chat by welcoming participants, inviting people to introduce themselves. The chat will proceed with a series of questions from @scratchedteam. Chat participants are encouraged to share their thoughts on questions and to pose their own questions to the group. To add to the conversation, be sure to include the chat hashtag #ScratchEdChat to your tweet. The chat will be 60 minutes, ending at 8pm (Boston time). What else would be helpful to know about Twitter? Here are a few Twitter tips, (adapted from Twitter’s Insider Tips) # - A hashtag is any word or phrase with the # symbol immediately in front of it.The symbol turns the word into a link that makes it easier to find and follow a conversation about that topic. .@ - Tweets that have a period (.) before the @reply are meant to be seen by all of a user’s followers--not just those who follow both the sender and the receiver. RT - Like an e-mail forward, retweets pass along another user’s tweet to all of your followers. This can be indicated with a “RT” when you manually retweet (copy and paste the content from a tweet into your own tweet) instead of using the retweet button. This is a way people spread news on Twitter and add their own commentary to the shared tweet. MT - Similar to RT, an abbreviated for “Modified Tweet.” You can place a “MT” before the retweeted text to pass along your own message in addition to a modified or shortened version of the original. HT - A “hat tip” or “heard through” symbol (HT) is used to indicated that you’ve found out about something from another Twitter user--and you want to credit them on Twitter."37703	Why Kids Create Games	10/26/15 13:57	"I'm curious about the impulses that underlie children's drive to create games (in a variety of platforms, including Scratch), especially children ages 6-9.

What percentage of kids do you think want total control, to start with a blank slate? And what portion want to start with something like a template that they can tweak?

A group of folks over in the LEGO Education Community forums started talking about creating a set of lessons that would teach Scratch programming and LEGO WeDo mechanics together, at an introductory level but with progressively increasing complexity. The current thought is to create an ""Open Education Resource"" in the form of a PDF book that can be freely downloaded.

So I dowloaded the new version and at the end it said: ""Adobe AIR  The required native extension is missing for this application. Try re-nstalling or contacting the publishre for assistance."" I then tried to troubleshoot. Removed Scratch 2.0 and uninstalled Adobe AIR. Then downloaded Adobe AIR and Scrtach 2.0. Same error message as Scratch 2.0 was trying to complete installation. On my home iMac I refrained from upgrading Sctach 2.0 and everything works fine including the WeDo extension and the Wedo extension on the online version.

The instructor was assisted by 6 Technology Mentors (also Computer Science majors). The program started on October 3, 2015, and will be ending on December 19, 2015. The program has been so successful that my organization has been invited to apply for a much larger grant. However, this grant application is asking for specific performance indicators and outcomes for the program. Has anyone had experience mapping the performance indicators and outcomes to the creative curriculum, or any other curriculum for that matter. My email address is: dsharif@ulec.org. Thank you.

These draft standards will be released for public comment in January. Four features distinguish the draft DL&CS Standards: The DL&CS Standards are organized into four strands: Computing and Society, Digital Tools and Collaboration, Computing Systems, and Computational Thinking. The DL&CS Standards progress coherently from grades K to 12. The standards emphasize a focused and coherent progression of knowledge and skills. As students progress through their K-12 education, they acquire increasingly sophisticated knowledge, skills, and dispositions in digital literacy and computer science. The DL&CS Standards articulate practices necessary for success. The practices cultivate the internalization of dispositions that skillful people in digital literacy and computer science apply in reasoning, creation, and problem solving. Practices speak to the types of performance students should be able to demonstrate. The DL&CS Standards complement other Massachusetts Curriculum Frameworks. The curriculum frameworks and DL&CS Standards overlap in meaningful and substantive ways and offer an opportunity for all students to better apply and learn digital literacy and computer science. Much of the knowledge, skills, and dispositions central to digital literacy and computer science, such as computational thinking, also apply to other subjects, including, but not limited to, science, technology and engineering and mathematics. You can download the standards on the Massachusetts DESE page."39102	About Me Project Rubric	12/21/15 12:50	"Is there a scoring rubric that has already been created for the ""About Me"" project for students?  I would like one and don't want to reinvent if it already exists."39124	Scratch@MIT 2016 Conference: August 4-6	12/22/15 12:46	"The biennial Scratch Conference is taking place this summer and registration is now open!

Computing Leaders ACM, Code.org, and CSTA Launch Effort to Guide Educators and State and District Policy Makers About K-12 Computer Science For most states and school districts, the notion of computer science for every student is a relatively new and unexplored topic. Responding to parent demand for their children to have access to computer science, there’s been a major shift in thinking by states and school districts about how to make computer science part of core academic work. They are asking big questions of the computing community: What is the appropriate scope and sequence for K-12 computer science? What does the community expect every student to learn in elementary school, in middle school, or by the time they graduate high school? And why? CSTA, ACM, and Code.org are joining forces with more than 100 advisors within the computing community (higher ed faculty, researchers, and K-12 teachers, many of whom are also serving as writers for the framework), several states and large school districts, technology companies, and other organizations to steer a process to build a framework to help answer these questions. A steering committee initially comprised of the Computer Science Teachers Association, the Association for Computing Machinery, and Code.org will oversee this project. The framework will identify key K-12 computer science concepts and practices we expect students exiting grades 2, 5, 8, and 12 to know. This effort will not develop educational standards. We expect that states and school districts will use the framework to create their own frameworks, guidance, and standards, and the CSTA has its own independent process for developing detailed K-12 computer science standards. Underpinning this effort is our belief that computer science provides foundational learning benefiting every child. Computer science gives students a set of essential knowledge and skills important for students’ learning and for their future careers and interests. This work is about defining the basic expectations for what every student should have a chance to learn about K-12 computer science to prepare for the emerging demands of the 21st century — not just to major in computer science or secure jobs as software engineers. The projected release date for the framework is summer 2016. More information, including monthly updates and how to get involved, can be found at K12CS.org.

We’re continuing to develop Teacher Accounts for Scratch, and we want to give you an update on our progress. Developing the Teacher Accounts has been more challenging than we expected -- and we know the delays have been frustrating for you. We now have a working prototype, and we will start alpha testing with a small group of teachers later this month. Based on feedback and requests we have received from educators using Scratch, we have focused on two main areas in this first version of Teacher Accounts: Account creation. Teachers will be able to create accounts for an entire class of students Classroom management. Teachers will be able to keep track of students’ work and participation on Scratch. Here’s a sneak peek at some screenshots from the current implementation of Teacher Accounts... A teacher can have multiple Classes: Each Class contains Students, Studios, and an Activity feed: Each Class also has a profile page on Scratch similar to a Member’s profile page: We are excited to share this update with you. If you have any questions or suggestions, please add them to this ScratchEd thread. -- Mitch Resnick and Christan Balch, for the MIT Scratch Team"39614	KY Scratch Educator Meetup: January 2016	1/14/16 14:09	"Join us for our KY Scratch Educator Meetup on January 30, 2016 from 10am to noon at Awesome, Inc. in Lexington, KY.

Malan, Professor of the Practice of Computer Science in the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences at Harvard. Along with others in the community, CS50 at Harvard is preparing a suite of resources for teachers who would like to teach AP CS Principles this coming school year. CS50 itself is Harvard’s (and Yale's) introduction to computer science for majors and non-majors alike that begins with Scratch and then transitions to C and then to web programming. (The course is also freely available via edX.) CS50 AP, meanwhile, will be a free adaptation for high schools that satisfies the new AP CS Principles curriculum framework. If you or a colleague might like to adopt or adapt CS50 in some form this fall or next, CS50 and our friends at Microsoft will be hosting a number of workshops this year designed to connect and equip educators for just that. (The workshops will offer CEUs and certification for PD.) A number of scholarships are also available for teachers who would like to take the course first through Harvard Extension School in preparation. If you’d like to learn more, see https://youtu.be/RVjHSAZdVJg for a quick introduction.

Where do you stay?	4/6/16 8:13	"When I attended ScratchMIT2012 I never would have thought that only four years later a would attend for a fifth time. But I am, and I'm looking forward to reconnect with fine people I met before, and prepared to enjoy totally unexpected things with people I've never met before ... It's a pity we can't stay at MIT Dorms this year (at least I found no refernece to the option). Cambridge / Boston hotels are heavy priced so I followed the suggestion of Derek Breen to book with a youth hostel  Six nights (August 1-7) are much cheaper than a single night at the Kendall Marriot. You may get what you pay for, but I think it can be good company if some more of us stay there.

We're long-time Scratch proponents and collaborators (from the pre-release days) and have built a company (Modkit) around extending Scratch to additional platforms and activities including robotics and microcontrollers. We are getting ready to test Modkit.io, a new text-based programing language inspired by Scratch, with 1000 early adopters and wanted to get some Scratch educators in on the discussion and testing. As most of you know, Scratch is more than just about eliminating syntax errors with graphical blocks but is as much about the simple yet powerful programming model that it exposes.  Writing code local to a ""sprite"" with built-in multi-tasking (more than one thing can happen at once) and the event driven ""hat"" blocks that describe when each stack of blocks should run are very important concepts not available in most text-based (or even blocks-based) programming environments.  Many of us have learned this the hard way when venturing outside of ScratchLand with our eager students. We're looking to change that with text code that feels and works just like Scratch: We think this will be useful for educators that use Scratch as a stepping stone to traditional programming languages (as Scratch is taught in a number of University courses) or for students who have mastered Scratch and may be able to benefit from exploring beyond the safe sandbox. It can also be useful to expose kids to ""physical computing"" and Wiring/Arduino which is the target for our very first release of the language.  In no way do we see this as a replacement for Scratch or the thoughtful syntax-error free environment it provides.  This early release is actually best in the hands of an experienced educator who has knowledge of text-based programming and/or the Wiring/Arduino platform. In any case if you're interested, we're running a Kickstarter to gather support and get this out to early educators and users.  We have a limited number of seats to try the language for Wiring/Arduino for the minimum Kickstarter pledge of $1.  We hope to see many of you on our Kickstarter page so that we can keep Scratch educators in mind as we continue to develop this new and important language.  We think the lessons learned from Scratch are applicaple to everyone but we have a special place in our hearts for Scratchers!

I'd like to create an extensive collection of top-quality Scratch programs.  There are some such programs available on the Scratch website, but sorting through everything and testing the programs to find sophisticated, top-quality lessons is extremely time-consuming. I'd like to know if anybody has put together such a collection already or is interested in helping create one.  I'm also looking for volunteers interested in helping to create sophisticated lessons that use good teaching strategies to teach standard subjects for grades K-7. BACKGROUND:  I run a very small nonprofit that works with primary schools in remote villages in Lesotho (Africa) where there are few teachers and the quality of teaching is extremely poor.  There are usually 50-70 students per classroom and one teacher may teach up to three grades, so students get virtually no individual attention or feedback.  Practically all the students lag 3-4 grade levels behind U.S. standards. We've set up locally-run programs that use laptops as an educational tool, not only to supplement the teachers' work but also to help the children teach themselves, requiring little or no assistance from their teachers. CONSTRAINTS: We are currently using refurbished One Laptop Per Child XO-1 laptops, run by solar panels.  We'd hoped the software that came with the XO laptops would be sufficient for students to learn on their own, but we've found it grossly inadequate.  There is no internet available in the area, so we cannot use web-based resources.  The XO laptops have a unique Linux operating system called Sugar.  Because of this, many existing programs and resources will not run on the laptops.  Fortunately, Scratch does run on them, though they only have Scratch 1.4 right now. USING SCRATCH:  None of our volunteers are trained computer programmers, but some of them can use Scratch.  We'ved decided Scratch is the easiest tool for us to use to reach our goal, which is eventually to create an entire curriculum of self-teaching, interactive computer lessons. We've created a limited number of lessons so far.  We've found that, because the lessons offer instant feedback the students have never gotten before, their' skills improve quickly and dramatically when they use these lessons. That's why I'm asking for your help.  It's an ambitious project, but I think it's worthwhile.  And hopefully, it is something that can be used by children and schools in other developing nations that also don't have access to the internet."42838	Using Scratch to load program to LittleBits Arduino	5/30/16 13:15	I am exploring the possiblity of teaching 5th Graders how to use Scratch to program LittleBits.  In order to make this happen a number of things need to be place.  I've followed this guide: http://goo.gl/9GVLKb by khanning.  I've not been successful.  Is there anyone who has had success in connecting Scratch to the LittleBits Arduino module?  I have Mac lab.  Thanks!42920	Saving as a mp4 or other format	6/3/16 18:43	"Hello, Is it possible to save a scratch project in a different format other than .sb2?

I really think this is the best thing we could do for our kids.” Lynette Goulet, Watertown Middle School, Watertown, MA “Now, when I’m making my lessons I’m always thinking, what am I saying to students, and how can I expose my students’ thinking?” Laszlo Bardos, Rivendell Academy, Fairlee, VT and Orford, NH “Through Critical Explorers, kids learn the value of patience and deliberateness, and that really hit home for me a couple of years ago when I got the first group of students in my 9th grade course who had gone through the Critical Explorers program in 7th grade. I gave them something to do, and they really dug into it — to a degree that I had never seen before. And I knew it was because of their CE experience. I think that’s a great thing to be able to teach kids to do — to dig deep, and be thoughtful, and careful, and patient, as they wrestle with big ideas.” Kraig Gustafson, History Coordinator, Watertown Public Schools, Watertown, MA “My looking at the piece [in Steve Seidel's session on looking at classroom work] felt like an ‘opening up’ process as opposed to the ‘narrowing’ feeling or process I sense when ‘correcting’ or typically ‘commenting’ on a student’s work.  The order of the steps encouraged wondering and, in the process — awe.” Holly Turner, The Common School, Amherst, MA “When a veteran teacher comes to me and says, ‘You know, I’ve been through a lot of professional development activities before and this one really hit home for me, it really resonated with me,’ you have to give the teachers a chance to explore that as much as they can.” Kimo Carter, Principal, Watertown Middle School, Watertown, MA “What if we were doing this from year to year, from grade to grade, every teacher approaching it from their own context, their own curricular perspective as we went along, what would that do over time for the thinking of our students?” Gordon Christie-Maples, Samuel Morey Elementary School, Fairlee, VT and Orford, NH"43279	Make a sprite draw on another sprite using the pen	6/22/16 19:07	"I am trying to make a sprite use the pen and draw spots on another sprite (giving a leopard his spots).

I've always wanted a way to make quick ""galleries"" of student work, for reviewing at the end of a project together, or for assessing their learning on my own time. I put together a simple website that anyone with a Google account can use to create a gallery.  Share the link with your students, and they can add their own Scratch projects to the gallery.  You'll see their full names, but everyone else sees just their initials. The website is free and published under a CC license.  Right now, it's in an alpha state, but I'd welcome feedback from anyone who cares to use it. Here's an example gallery of some 4th graders' Plinko projects: https://scratchgallery.io/?gallery=M1HURK2K1V Thanks, Jeffrey Gordon East Bay Innovation Academy Upper School Computer Science Teacher Oakland, CA"43921	Scratch Teacher Accounts now Available	8/9/16 11:34	"Hello from the Scratch Team!

I expect a few eyerolls when I introduce it, just because that's what kids their age do. But I want them to see for themselves that Scratch is really cool!  Are there any videos that I can show them to get them excited about Scratch?  How about games on Scratch -- where can I find  sample ones that they'll really enjoy? Thank you."44304	Digital Citizenship	9/1/16 22:14	How do you incorporate digial citizenship in your Scratch classroom?  Also how do you deal with suggestive material (example: Le Worm and some of the music videos)?44368	Teacher Accounts - How Do I add existing (followed) Scratchers to a new Class?	9/6/16 12:16	"Not sure if this is the correct place to post this so apologies in advance. I am working towards offering a structured week by week ""lesson plan"" that coordinates with the school curriculum. Scratch is the chosen tool. however, my son sees his career in coding and programming - his school unfortunately are not offering coding (but are covering general IT). I have done coding myself over the past 25 years and have decided to assist him and his friends in getting started in Programming. To this end I want to use Scratch to teach many concepts and principles for IT and Coding. What I am struggling with is the following. I have created a new Class - I want to add an existing Scratch user to the class. When I go to Students and the Add User - I enter the correct (doubled checked) user name for the Scratch User. I get prompted that the user name already exists (which it does) but it will not let me add the user to the class. I have followed the user in question (my son) but how can i add existing users that i know to a class so that they can follow the plans for the class and submit their projects? Help please. I don't want to have to create brand new scratch accounts for students each time i create a new class, but will likely be adding teh same group of users time after time and class after class. Also It would be very useful if we as teachers could upload a txt file that provided instruction (or requirements) that each student must comply with in order to successfully complete a class/studio/project - is this possible. Mark."44410	Development Manager position with Scratch Foundation	9/8/16 11:42	"Original post on Idealist.

I then tested several student accounts, and in each case Scratch says the password is incorrect.  The passwords in the uploaded CSV files each had seven characters - a combination of letters and numbers, and the minimum number is six, so I don't think that is the problem. If I enter a student's account and change the password manually, the account will log in. I hope there is a more efficient workaround to resolve this issue. It is not practical to enter 97 accounts and change each password manually. This is especially daunting in that I have another class to create that will have 120 students. I'd appreciate any suggestions and insights the ScratchEd community might have. Thanks!

What if I wrote a program that the teachers could use to take their class lists and split them into random teams/groups (teams of 2,3 or 4).  Study guides, subject reviews, etc, groups all randomly generated which will push kids to interact with the classmates they don't normally interact with and just to spice things up. I created 8 IMPORT lists (for now), those never get touched after you import your .txt file, they are just referred to by the Selection List.  That then randonly chooses the teams dependent on how many teams are chosen.  I plan to incorporate the whole school soon, prek-8, so those teachers and the Phys Ed teachers can use this random team/group generator.  In my tech class the demo for 7th grade was a hit, they loved the ""lottery"" of where they would end up and how teams/groups were so different every time. Feel free to use if you'd like. Directions: Create a .txt file for each of your homerooms import that to one of the IMPORT lists, just keep track of what sprite handles what list. probably create a new costume for each selection sprite so your class names are displayed properly The program does the rest. I do plan on offering an option for 1 team, or one randomized order. The teachers wanted that option for reading paragraphs, spelling bee, etc in class.  Looks to be a fun resource.  Hope this is something the Educational Community could use.  I had a lot of fun writing it. https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/135318800/"46596	ITCH & Teacher Accounts	12/15/16 9:56	"Hello!

(http://www.csjumpstartr.com/schools) More info: A collaborator and I - both Scratch enthusiasts in informal-ed settings - have been working on a Scratch-based product we call CSJumpstartr. The driving purpose is to make it easier for teachers (and homeschool parents) use Scratch for ""show what you know"" projects in existing curriculum units, without themselves needing to teach coding. CSJumpstartr is a self-contained build of the open-source Scratch 2.0 editor and a collection of templates for content projects (slideshows, quizzes, poster-boards, etc.) with integrated step-by-step guidance delivered in the browser. Each template is supported by PDF worksheets, documentation, and ""take it further"" challenges. Kids can work through completing a template independently, so the teacher can integrate the project into an existing curriculum without needing to teach coding too. Using our templates, kids with no Scratch experience can create a finished project; and kids with more experience and/or a penchant for tinkering can expand on the template. We know there are a lot of teachers who would like to integrate creative coding, but they face barriers like lack of curricular flexibility, or lack of expertise, or lack of IT support. We think our approach can help, by supporting teachers to use Scratch to deliver traditional end-of-unit summary projects.  We'd love it if our product resulted in Scratch getting used in more schools by more teachers. In that vein, we are looking for teachers and schools - ideally in the Boston area - who are interested in piloting CSJumpstartr with 4th to 6th graders. We'd get you set up and advise you on implementation, and in return we'd ask for feedback and ideas for improvement. If you're interested, please get in touch with me here on ScratchEd or via our website (http://www.csjumpstartr.com/schools).

I am a doctoral candidate studying School Psychology at Temple University in Philadelphia, PA. I am conducting a dissertation study using the Creative Computing Curriculum for Scratch with ten to twelve year-old students during the summer of 2017 in an elementary/middle school in West Philadelphia. Among other things, I will be assessing student learning of computational concepts in a debugging task as described by Brennan and Resnick (2012). The design of the study is a randomized control trial, meaning that one group of students will go through the Creative Computing Curriculum in its entirety, while another group of students will attend regularly scheduled daily activities. Following the first group of students, the second group will then go through the Creative Computing Curriculum so that all students involved in the study have the opportunity to learn and engage with Scratch and the activities within the Creative Computing Curriculum. Each group will take a pre-test of their knowledge of computational concepts, which will be language-based and similar to The Fairy Assessment (Werner, Denner, Campe, & Kawamoto, 2012), as well as a post-test that will be comprised of a series of bugged Scratch programs that students will be asked to debug, or add/modify a function or feature. I am wondering if anyone in the ScratchEd community has developed sample Scratch projects with bugs that may be able to be used to test whether or not students understand specific computational concepts, e.g., sequences, loops, parallelism, events, conditionals, and data structures. If so, I would love to hear about how you developed the projects, and if you would be willing to lend the sample projects for use in my dissertation study.

I am a doctoral candidate studying School Psychology at Temple University in Philadelphia, PA. I am conducting a dissertation study using the Creative Computing Curriculum for Scratch with ten to twelve year-old students during the summer of 2017 in an elementary/middle school in West Philadelphia.

Thank you for taking the time to read this; I am sorry it is so long, but I am looking for advice, and maybe some critique as to what I did wrong the first time. I am a librarian, NOT really a trained teacher, and I appreciate any help I can get! ?I work for a public library that offers after school and summer S.T.E.A.M.-based classes and programs. Last spring (2016) I was asked to do a one hour introduction to Scratch as a part of this program because our youth director noticed I was helping a few students who had questions about Scratch. I agreed to do the class and put together what I thought would be a great hour for the kids, but it was kind of a chaotic disaster. Here's what I did: ?1) Had them watch a short, exciting introductory video that demonstrated all the fun things you can do with Scratch. (This can be found here: https://vimeo.com/65583694 ?) ?2) Showed them a VERY short powerpoint (2 slides) with a few common coding and Scratch terms. I had students from many backgrounds and skill levels, so I just wanted to make sure we all knew what ""coding"" meant, and what a ""script"" was, etc. There were only 5 terms in the entire powerpoint. ?3) Then we went to Scratch online and played around with some of the shared projects, just so they could see what other people were doing. (We only did this for about 5-7 minutes). ?4) I had them open a blank project and did a quick overview of all the different parts of Scratch (scrpit area, stage, sprites, etc...), which I figured was a good idea since most of the kids had never tried Scratch before. ?5) We then launched in to creating a small game that I had chosen in advance. The game was Star Hunter ?from one of the Scratch books I was using at the time. The title escapes me at the moment, as I was working with about 4 different books. ?6) Then, at the end of the class, I had a whole packet of materials for them to take home: Scratch cards, some free Scratch stickers that I got at a library conference, a new game for them to try, an info sheet for parents, a Scratch book list, and a small vocabulary list to help them understand some of the coding terms they would encounter. ?I HAD PROBLEMS. Phew! As you can imagine, this was a lot to cram into an hour, and we ended up running about an hour and fifteen minutes. This kind of irked some of the parents who were waiting outside of our computer lab to pick up their kids, so I need to trim some of the fat and smooth out some of the ""wrinkles"". Here are the problems I encountered: ?- As I mentioned in the subject line, the class is for ages 8 to 12. I had a really hard time getting this age group to follow what I was doing. They wanted to branch off on thier own right away and some of them made quite a mess of the program we were trying to make. I had to fix these kids' code before we could move on, taking up precious time. ?- They were just not interested in any of the preliminary stuff that I did (#'s 1-4 above). They all sat there, deadpan, looking at me like I had 2 heads. Maybe this is normal for that age group? Should I just scratch those parts completely? Maybe just the video? Shoud I assume these kids are learning these terms at school? Arrrgh!! ?- I thought I had chosen a really cool game for them to make. I was corrected right away (kids are honest like that, eh?). The game took too long to make, they didn't want to be locked into the sprites and backgrounds that I pre-chose to save time, and some of them didn't even bother to try and make the game I selected. I eventually just let those kids create and explore on thier own with the understanding that if they needed my help it would have to be after the class. ?- Being a library, our public computers do not have external speakers. Public users can bring headphones to use, and we have headphones for our adult computer classes, but I was not going to give the 8 - 12 year olds headphones because I figured they would never pay attention to me that way! The kids were all very disappointed that they could add sounds to their project but not near what they sound like. I had a set of speakers that I attached to the admin computer so I could play them examples of the sounds, but this was not fulfilling for them. I don't know what I'm going to do about this. Even if I could scare up 12 sets of speakers for the class, I can only imagine the noise this would create. ?- They were not really interested in the packets I made so I felt like I failed to pique their interest. I know that we are a digital society now, and kids especially so, so maybe they are just not used to getting information this way. Most of the information I put in the take home packets is available online, anyway, so I will probably just skip this next time. Most of the online help I have found so far is for an entire 10-12 week Scratch curriculum. I do not need this much material. Any suggestions? Has anyone else taught a short introductory class like this? ?My thoughts are to cut out the vocab. power point and the Scratch overview (I would just explain as we went) and to then just have a ton of ideas to get the kids started on whatever they feel like making. I could have scratch cards and print off some small projects for the kids to try (if they want), and then just sort of float the room and help them individually. Last time, this is what I ended up doing for most of the class anyway. I think more freedom to create might be a better idea than trying to drag them all through a lengthy peice of Scratch code. Thoughts on this plan? ?Thank you so very much if you have made it this far. This is a long shot cry for help (lol), and I am sure that I will figure out something for them to do... but I thought if someone with more experience could weigh-in that it might help me."47438	Participate in the Public Review Period for K-12 CSTA Standards	2/9/17 15:24	"The revised CSTA K-12 Computer Science Standards are open for public review until 11:59pm PST on Wednesday, February 15.

At the beginning of the next school year I have the same teachers, but each one has different students. I don't want to ""end"" a previous class because students can no longer access their accounts, which they will need to do with their next teacher. I also want them to be able to go back in and continue exploring and creating, even if they have moved up to their next school. Any suggestions on how I can manage moving students from one class to another? To keep student accounts open I can just create an ""archived"" class for students who move to the middle school.

For example it would be nice to be able to create an operation with four inputs the x and y coordinates for two points, that would output the distance between the two points.I am certain that many people would find this feature useful. My second suggestion is that Scratchers be able to save a ""toolbox"" of blocks (and hopefully operstions} that they have created. Then we would not have to reinvent the wheel each time we found a need for a tool we have already created. This would allow people to share their tools in the same way that we share projects. Other Scratchers would have the opportuntiy to use and remix custom blocks and operations. As they rated these tools the most popular and useful ones would rise to the top in the same way as so many things are crowd rated on the internet. i have no idea how difficult these features would be to implement, but I hope you agree that they would be a welcome addition to the Scratch environment."50615	Meetup Photos - We need you!	6/15/17 10:02	Hello all!

I'm reaching out to tell you a bit about Scratch Day. Each year, people around the world gather at local Scratch Day events to celebrate the Scratch coding language and online community. Scratch Days are festive gatherings that bring young people together to share projects and ideas, tinker, experiment, and learn from one another. The events are typically in May, but can be organized any day of the year! Teachers are celebrating Scratch Day all around the world by hosting gatherings in their schools, dedicating class time to Scratch activities, and/or helping parents connect with Scratch resources. As of now, there are just over 1170 global Scratch Day events. We'd love to see a Scratch Day in every state in the US! Will you join the celebration? If interested in hosting a Scratch Day in your classroom, school, or community, check out the resources on the How to Host page of the Scratch Day site, and see the resources we've created on the Scratch Foundation blog.

Background:  I'm an elementary and middle school technology teacher.  I teach in a lab with 6-8th grade students and push into teachers' classrooms K-5 where students have access to chromebooks or iPads.  I'm trying to integrage Scratch and CS thinking to be across the regular ed curriculum but I'm running into a snag... My issue: I'd like to be able to create groups of students so that my student ""scratchers"" could participate in more than one class.  For instance, I'd like to create a class under my account that students can particpate in during tech class and allow them to participate in another class that they can use in their regular-ed classroom - much like how code.org allows for student users to be monitored by multiple teacher's accounts. Currently I'm creating ""classes"" of students for each grade level so that they can use their account multiple years in a row and have access to them in more than one environment.  Ex:  ""Class of 2022"", etc. I have a feeling that creating different studios for each classroom environment is going to be the fix that I find, but I'm wondering if someone else has encountered this. This feature would be helpful so that students can keep their projects for multiple years instead of loosing access to their creations when a teacher ""ends"" the class.  It also would students access to the backpack across multiple environments and across unpublished projects.

I posted in the Teaching with Scratch Facebook group that I was interested in collaborating with educators from around the world to help teach my students how to work collaboratively on a Scratch project while gaining a better understanding of global digital learning. I am excited that two different people have reached out so far beyond the post and we are working together to create projects for our students! My questions are as follow: 1. Using teacher accounts, how can I invite students from another class to follow my students' studio? Do they simply follow my students by having the list of the usernames? I'm looking for the simplest logistical plan as this will take place for hopefully 2nd-5th-grade students. 2.  Since projects are not yet collaborative in the live format, am I correct that one student must initiate the project and then the other would remix and edit that project? And then continue this procedure? Any tips/experience welcome or if anyone would like to participate, email me: alexis.cobo@pinecrest.edu Thank you!"57983	Organizing an experiment : teaching Scratch in 2 languages.	9/16/18 14:09	"I am very motivated and curious about finding the perfect format and setting up a cycle of lessons where the young students are stimulated to learn 2 languages  at the same time : Scratch coding blocks and a foreign language. How to blend and gamify as much as possible these 2 foundations ? I have no idea where to start OR find resources, people who have tried this before. Anyone intrigued to team up with me. Obviously I welcome also non-english speaking experts (i.e. Italians) Thanks in advance Grazie"58383	Dr Scratch issues	9/30/18 22:25	Can anyone tell me please why I cannot get on to Dr Scratch Regards Cath58412	Scratch Educators in Nunavut/NWT/Yukon	10/2/18 12:38	"I know there must be some of us! I'm just about to begin folding Scratch into my classroom, and I'd love to hear how that went for other people who teach in Canada's north. I'm a little nervous about the whole project because I'll be learning right alongside the kids, but I think there's some greta potential there. I'd be especially interested to hear about anyone's experiences using Scratch as a motivating tool for ELL students, of which I have many. Anyway, I don't expect a ton of replies to this, but hopefully there are at least a handful of you out there. Cheers, Adam"58448	Changing Classes	10/4/18 8:53	"I have been using the Teacher account in Scratch for a while.  My problem is that I have students that have moved or have left my school.  I want to remove them from my class so that I just see current students.  I know that I can delete their account but I don't want to do that.  I know that many of these students continue to use Scratch on their own and if I delete their class, they will lose their prjects.  Any suggestions or work arounds?"58831	"Broadcast vs. ""when background changes""?"	10/22/18 13:49	"I always use broadcasts to make multiple things happen on one event, like when score = 15, broadcast ""level2"". Then when screen and sprites receive ""level2"", things change accordingly (background change, characters hide or show, etc.) However, I've heard that some people just do it all on ""when background changes"". That would be a lot easier, since you don't have to send messages, have all the characters listen for specific messages, etc. I haven't tried it in a few years, but I recall getting unexpected results using this method. And I never got unexpected results from broadcasts. Oh, and I'm using standalone Scratch 1.4 on the Raspberry Pi, if that makes a difference. TIA, Bob Irving Porter-Gaud School Charleston, SC"58903	Error message when trying to add followers to studio	10/24/18 18:00	"I created a studio. Yet when I attempt to add some of the members of my club to curate the studio, I get an error message: Sorry, you don't have permission to do that. The only difference I can find in the users I am trying to add as curators is related to the ability to add comments. The two users I was able to add as curators have not turned off commenting, while the three users I'm unable to add as curators have turned off commenting. Has anybody experienced this problem or received this error message? Please advise.

Anyhow I was wondering if anyone  had a contact at MIT for someone they know who works in the Scratch project who I could contact to help.  If so please email me at barront@fpsct.org Thank you much!!!"59823	Scratch 3.0 + Camera	11/21/18 13:27	"Hello Everyone With the 3.0 there are four ways to get a new sprite or backdrop.  A new one is a random selction.  But I am wondering about the ability to use the device's camera to take a picture.  It was one of the four choices in 2.0.  Will ""Camera"" be included in 3.0 when it goes live on January 2nd or is it being discontinued? or replaced? If so, with what?

I am now giving them homework assignments to code a specific program. My understanding is that I cannot see each students project unless they share it, but then everyone can see the project code including their fellow students. How can I assign my students the same project on Scratch where they must work independently?

K–12 teachers across the country are engaging in creative computing activities with their students in beautiful and inspiring ways. We love the ways we’ve seen teachers draw on students’ creativity and imagination to spark interest in computing. We’re looking to connect with educators across the country who are engaging in this type of teaching. Are you one of these teachers? We want to understand more about your creative computing teaching practices, with the ultimate goal of inspiring a broad audience of K–12 educators to support creative computing in their own classrooms.

We have 2 or 3 experienced Scratchers; the rest are beginners. Since Jan 2, I have been trying to embrace Scratch 3.0, but, while I like some of the changes, nothing can compensate for the loss of per-block help. Yes, I am aware of the Scratch Cards, and these are good. But as a prorgrammer of 30+ years, it is hard to conceive of a computer language without a reference document. How are others coping?"60188	Social Studies - Humanities	3/7/19 10:07	"Hello Teachers! I am looking for a class of students that will collaborate with my class.   We are in Calgary, Canada and would like to do a cultural project with a class of any grade 1 to 12.   We are looking for a class that is in a different country than ours, or that are in eastern Canada (as this is a valuable difference as well). I have collaborated with classrooms around the world before and found it to be an amazing experience for all involved.  This project will be simple.  The project for my grade 5 students will have this is our  guiding question  'What makes us Canadian?""  and the international class would do the same for thier country.  Students in the class would create Scratch projects about significant historical events, people that have had an impact on their country, key ideas...  whtever is in your curriculum. If you are in grade 4 to 12, each student could make a project.  Younger grades may make a project together as a class. A really exciting part is that we would share a Scratch Studio.  The students would communicate to each other through their projects and through comments.   Knowing that there is a groups of studetns from another part of the world that they are working with is tremendously exciting for the students.  They love to show off their own countries.  They also love to make Scratch projects!
