Can I still assist and lead during LEGO We Do / Scratch activities? Well actually I am very knowledgeable in computing because that's my profession (IT Consultant).

My role is to provide and setup the technological environment. In the end teachers should be capable of setting up their own sessions and supporting students in the process. Is there any documented practise how to prepare teachers for a Lego We Do/Scratch acctivities? Kind regards, Urso Wieske"

24238,"""Real"" Programming",12/7/13 23:13,"I've encountered this misconception frequently. There tends to be a forgetting that these words that I'm typing in this response are themselves abstract pictorial symbols strung in a learned and agreed upon ordering. I've begun to ask if there is a cognitive benefit, or a cognitive difference, in the construction and recognition of these typographic patterns, that renders them superior to other kinds of visual patternings. There is a sense of cultural interia, tied to a received definition of authenticity, of what behaviors or signals mark ""real"" programming. It's taken persistent conversations, and a recognition of when someone is ready to hear this ""novel"" definition."
24238,"""Real"" Programming",12/7/13 23:15,"It is a legitimate concern that visual languages may not contain all of the functionality of something like C++, but for everyday programming tasks Scratch is more than capable and I know that in the UK they use it right up to A-level to teach key concepts. Such concerns remind me of the days when people used the Command line and WIndows was not a real operating system.  I wonder how many of these people are exclusively using the Linux Shell now? There are advantages in terms of resource use, but the rest of us have moved on."
24238,"""Real"" Programming",12/8/13 15:40,"A blog post submitted/reblogged by ""fyprocessing,"" a Tumblr site devoted to the work of artists experimenting with Processing, offers an interesting point of view with regard to the different expressive potentials offered by different programming environments. It suggests that different imaginaries, or different imaginations, may be sparked or accessed by interaction with different tool kits. The argument echoes Clifford Geertz and Marshall MacLuhan's observation that humans shape and are then subsequently shaped by our tools. The link for the original is: http://fyprocessing.tumblr.com/post/69317286302/hamoid-my-first-animgif-programmed-in-nodebox and I quote it here in its entirety: My first animgif programmed in Nodebox. I still prefer code, but I see the advantages of Nodebox: Pause, play and rewind your animation. Go to the previous and next frames. Tweak values and modify your program *while it runs*. No need to stop and restart your program. This is great for experimentation. Export a range of frames. Export an mp4 movie or a vector PDF file. You can write your own modules in Python and Clojure. What I don’t like: No animgif nor gif export. Each time I export I must set the range and file format. Frame rate not so high. No access to the great collection of Processing libraries (midi, webcam, graphic tablet, OSC, etc). It’s great for people learning to code, and for those who don’t like typing code. It may also be great for sketching concepts, tweaking values and experimenting, to later port the idea to an environment that performs faster. Our creations are influenced by the tools we use. I suspect the kinds of creations we produce by typing code (Processing, Open Frameworks, SuperCollider) and by connecting nodes with wires (Nodebox, PD) can differ, the same way the kinds of results we get when using different programming languages can also be different. For instance, some languages  make it easier to write recursive programs. Other languages make it easy to work with big data sets, or with strings. I wonder… what is Nodebox best at?"
24238,"""Real"" Programming",12/9/13 11:51,"I've been teaching Scratch for a number of years, and a coworker and I would often have this back and forth. I'd say I wasn't a programmer, he'd argue that I could use Scratch, so I could program. Now I am student in Karen Brennan's class, and am thinking about this question in my final paper. I try and draw parallels to other things I know how to do, using iMovie is editing video but is not as powerful as using Final Cut Studio, but I'd still say they are both video editing. So, why, in my head is Scratch not programming or programming in the same sense but just lacks some of the capabilities of other languages. I think for me it has something to do with identifying as a ""programmer,"" but I am still trying to break that down. @Rafael, I am compelled by the idea of different environments supporting or leading to different potentials, that begins to take away some of the heirarchy between text and visual based programming. I wonder how many people on this thread do know how to program in a text based language. I think its probably valuable to foster the identity of a ""programmer"" in youth in Scratch classes I am facilitating, but its still struggle with calling myself a programmer."

Pencils, brushes and crayons offer different things. It's easy for me to forget this, or to treat it as transparently self-evident. Sometimes, when I'm feeling mischievous, I think about the range of expression possible with a hammer and a piano. Both could be seen as percussive uses of a lever. ;)"

Of course, I'm expecting bugs to pop up here and there -- if you notice anything, please don't hesitate to let me know. Bug reports are always welcome! Some aspects of the redesign that I'm particularly excited about: The redesign of the Resources section. In addition to refining the design of the search interface (now including searching by language!), we have three different pathways: new to Scratch, familiar with Scratch, and experienced with Scratch. If you have comments or suggestions for the pathways pages, I'd love to hear them. The addition of the Events section. Our events were formerly listed on a separate site, which made it hard to keep track of them. I'm hoping this integration will help people feel more connected to the face-to-face and real-time components of the ScratchEd community. The redesign of the Members section. You can now find people with similar interests (by age/grade level, curricular area, language) in addition to geographic proximity. To specify your interests, go to your profile (""My Profile"") at the top-right of the screen, then ""Edit"", then ""Member"". We'll be sending more information about the changes (in a video tutorial format) later this week. Thank you! Karen"

33727,"2 Week Scratch Teaching Positions in West Roxbury, MA",4/17/15 13:38,"i2 Camp is seeking both a Lead Teacher and Assistant Teacher for two week-long Scratch Game Design courses being held at Roxbury Latin.  The courses run from July 6 to July 10 and from July 13 to July 17. Course Description In this course, you will use Scratch to create an original video game with custom graphics, sound effects and music. You will begin by remixing an existing game, gradually gaining design skills and confidence. When you are ready to develop a whole new game, you will learn how to focus your ideas, integrate player feedback and refine your 2D game before sharing it with the world. No prior computer programming experience is required. Working for i2 Camp i2 Camp is a hands-on, project-based STEM summer day camp designed to broaden middle school students’ exposure to innovative science, technology, engineering and math. The co-ed camp has developed its program by partnering with some of the world’s leading scientific and academic institutions, including MIT, The Museum of Science in Boston, Stanford University, MathWorks, the New York Academy of Sciences and Teachers College, Columbia University. Teachers will be trained by i2 Camp’s curriculum partners to understand the curriculum and the activities planned for each course. Courses will be focused on hands-on learning and will therefore be limited to a maximum of 20 children, with up to three instructors in each course, including a lead teacher, an associate teacher and a high school student acting as a “near peer.” Lead teachers will be responsible for overseeing this team of instructors. Lead Teachers– Must have previous K-12 school teaching experience and an interest in project-based learning. Associate Teachers– Must have or be working toward a degree in a STEM field or in K-12 STEM education. Previous classroom experience is a plus. The camp will run in each location Monday – Friday, and teachers must be at the camp from 8:30am – 4:30pm every day. Children of teachers who enroll in the camp will be given a discount to attend the camp. Lunch will be served each day. Salary varies by location and will be discussed during the interview process.

I gave them something to do, and they really dug into it — to a degree that I had never seen before. And I knew it was because of their CE experience. I think that’s a great thing to be able to teach kids to do — to dig deep, and be thoughtful, and careful, and patient, as they wrestle with big ideas.” Kraig Gustafson, History Coordinator, Watertown Public Schools, Watertown, MA “My looking at the piece [in Steve Seidel's session on looking at classroom work] felt like an ‘opening up’ process as opposed to the ‘narrowing’ feeling or process I sense when ‘correcting’ or typically ‘commenting’ on a student’s work.  The order of the steps encouraged wondering and, in the process — awe.” Holly Turner, The Common School, Amherst, MA “When a veteran teacher comes to me and says, ‘You know, I’ve been through a lot of professional development activities before and this one really hit home for me, it really resonated with me,’ you have to give the teachers a chance to explore that as much as they can.” Kimo Carter, Principal, Watertown Middle School, Watertown, MA “What if we were doing this from year to year, from grade to grade, every teacher approaching it from their own context, their own curricular perspective as we went along, what would that do over time for the thinking of our students?” Gordon Christie-Maples, Samuel Morey Elementary School, Fairlee, VT and Orford, NH"

I begin the lesson by demonstrating important elements of the build, then pass out the bulidsheets, and my students build the projects individually.  After students have successfully built a working version of the project, they work to customize it, making it their own. My students' enthusiasm for programming is overwhelming.  They cheer when I announce a build is scheduled; they push through challenging work, so they can earn time to improve their projects.  It is, quite simply, the best thing that's ever happened to my teaching, and I'm eager to share these little modelers with anyone who'll take the time to look at them. The e-book is nearly done; I'm just doing the page layouts for the final few projects.  I will publish the books for free under a creative commons license, and I'd also like to produce a series of build screencasts, that are similar to the lessons I deliver to my students.  Anyone can access the e-book here: http://goo.gl/pHF6Hd This year's class has built the first four projects so far; here are some student examples: Thousand Modeler: http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/26165870/ Multiple Thousands Modeler: http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/26522183/ Money Clicker: http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/26890050/ Digit Dotter: http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/28295704 If you have any questions or comments, or you end up using these in your classroom, I'd love to hear from you.

954,9/26 Workshop - Reflections,9/26/09 21:07,"What a nice afternoon! Thank you Mitch and Karen for you hospitality! I spent the 2 hour drive back to the bucolic Monadnocks thinking about what a powerful tool Scratch is. On the surface, it is so cool that kids can replicate and invent media experiences they are currently consuming... but the transformative aspect of the tool is all about shifting our mental models about what it means to be about a learner/creator. This tool might allow us to begin to ask different questions in the classroom mmm... ""What is interesting about this?"" When we heard the story about the math deficient student who had the number line, positive-negative numbers AHA moment making his Scratch, it was just another chiming bell reminding us that 1 size does not work. Let's advocate adding Scratch to a list of options to demonstrate mastery of a concept! I was also very attunned to the fact that, a la Prensky, most of us are digi immigrants. A HUGE factor in allowing tools like Scrach to become more ubiquitous and pervasive is the need to realign the teacher's head so that they don't need to understand the technical level of what is happening. My most satisfied teachers are as gee-whiz about the coolness factor of the final project as the kids AND they are happy to see the key learning objectives articulated in the Scratch project. The best teachers - keep their hands in their pockets and ask, ""What do you want to do with what you just observed?"" Lastly, the need for us to honor and respct that we are homo ludens. We play to learn. We need most to transform/unlearn the behaviors that most teachers are judged by. Defeat the bell, the segmentation by discipline and we start new trails of inquiry!"
954,9/26 Workshop - Reflections,9/27/09 18:19,"I think your point about letting go of the technical level is interesting and important. While they don't need to be in control of (or understand) every aspect of interactions with Scratch, I do think it's important for educators to have a strong sense of the possible. What can Scratch help me and my students achieve? How to communicate that space of possibility for people is an interesting challenge!"
954,9/26 Workshop - Reflections,9/27/09 18:20,Ha! I got so wrapped up in responding to your post that I didn't say thanks. Thanks for coming to yesterday's workshop -- it was great to see you there!
954,9/26 Workshop - Reflections,9/30/09 5:42,"Hi. I hope you don't mind me sharing some thoughts. Yesterday, I had ninja35 and audifreak with me and we were having a Children's Day party.  One of the things we had to do was a shared Scratch project. I started by teaching audifreak how to draw a kingfisher by copying from a picture of one. She continued with the drawing and ninja35 contributed his input. Then we decided to have some fun and made it into a game.  I left the kids to complete it and they had great fun.  http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/audifreak/698625 The children learned how to work together as a team and they learned different scratch skills from one another as one took over when the other got stuck.  I think that Scratch is such a wonderful tool for team projects as well as for individual projects.  I believe that if you form the children into teams where each team comprises students with differing levels of scratch skills, they will learn very fast from one another.  I guess that the facilitator or teacher must be vigilant to ensure that the more adept student does not take over completely but learns to teach the younger (in terms of skill) scratch students."

It seems that the three senarios do not execute simultaneously. The first lines of the senarios of the sprites 2 & 3 are drawn and then are erased. It produces the desired result if I put the clear command at the third sprite only or if I put the clear command at a senario at the background and insert a wait commad to all sprites. What puzzles me is that the three senarios do not execute simultaneously. Thank you for your time.

I write a detailed paper for each project and distribute these as pdf files, announced on the blog, and avaialble on request by sending an email to grandadscience@gmail.com. I will not upload any project in the future without documentation. The free-form environment offered by Scratch is a wonderful place to play and create. But there are those users that are interested in mathematics and in acquiring new programming skills. My blog is designed to offer interested  members of this group the opportunity to dive a bit deeper into mathematics and programming. Visit my blog and find out if it interests you. If so, visit often. Direct students to my blog. They might find an interesting topic or two to explore. The decision to start a blog originated from a comment a user made about my Lindenmayer Systems project uploaded to Scratch. His comment was positive but also asked a question. How does that work? No math, science, or programmiing teacher can resist answering that question. So, trhe blog is my answer. To learn is to be alive!"

2429,A New Resource for teaching Scratch to kids ages 5-8,1/26/10 15:01,"Hi! My name is Crystal, and I am a current freshman at MIT.  I have been working as a research student in the Lifelong Kindergarten group for the past month.  I have created a new resource for teaching Scratch to kids ages 5-8. It is a series of activities and pointers for teaching Scratch to young students.  After these activities alone, the students will have enough tools to create their own stories.  I work through the creation of a simple underwater scene to show how Scratch can be made easy for kids in this age group.  As an educator, you need only minimal experience in Scratch to be able to use this resource. Here is a link to my preliminary draft: New Resource I would love some feedback! Tell me what you think! Thanks, Crystal"
2429,A New Resource for teaching Scratch to kids ages 5-8,1/27/10 14:24,"Hi, Much appreciated that you take the time to put that together and share it.  I was contemplating how to get teachers and students started using Scratch here (in Afghanistan) and this is a really nice starting point for lessons. Perhaps you should add this resource to OER commons / Merlot etc?  I was quite surprised to find that the OER repos really don't feature that many Scratch resources compared to how many great already existing Scratch projects there are to demonstrate in  an interactive way many key curriculum concepts.   Lots of Java applets.. not many Scratch links. I would definitely like to use this as a starting point - perhaps we find something that people are going to be more familiar with here than fish as this is a landlocked place...  Let's see... Thanks! -Mike"
2429,A New Resource for teaching Scratch to kids ages 5-8,1/29/10 7:14,"Thanks, Crystal, this is very interesting, and I really like the setup! I'm currently targeting age group 10-12, but I would also like to work with smaller children in the future. Here are my comments: - It would be good to roughly indicate  in the resource how much time each exploration will take. - I like the opening activity a lot and I would definitely do it. - I think it's good to defer the green flag to the challenging explorations. I think understanding the difference between preview mode and presentation mode is not  easy, and working in preview mode only avoids this issue - Exploration 1: when you say to the children ""let's get the fish moving"", the natural reflex of many is to drag it around on the screen - task accomplished. How do you explain to them that this is not the point? I haven't come up with a convincing answer to this yet. If you have an answer, it would be very good to put it into the resource. - Exploration 1 again: I think ""move 10 steps"" can be explained easily, but how about ""turn 15 degrees""? Are you talking about the 15 at all, or do you use ""turn 15 degrees"" as a black box that just does some turning? It would be useful also here  to have a hint for the teacher in the resource. - Exploration 6: this seems a pretty tough one to me. In most programming languages, it is natural to do if-then-else  before loops, but in Scratch, that doesn't apply. The ""forever"" block is arguably simpler than if-then, as there is no condition. Even for ages 10-12, I'm starting with ""forever"". For example, you could make the fish move forever and combine it with ""bounce on edge"" to create a very simple yet natural animation of the fish swimming back and forth. Also, I could imagine that the touching-color block together with if-then is over the heads of most 5-8 year old, but in order to really tell this, I don't have enough experience. I'm planning to test it with my 7-year old daughter. - General: When teaching Scratch, is it about Scratch, or about programming concepts? My approach is to teach concepts, and I'm using Scratch as an excellent tool to do it. I think that any resource should carefully reflect on what it is trying to teach. You are saying in the overview that ""students will have enough tools to create their own stories"", and that they can ""express themselves"". It's clear to me what you mean, but if I wanted to be picky, I could say that they don't need Scratch for that. Paper and crayons as in the opening activity would be completely sufficient. What you are really doing is teaching concepts that enable the students to express themselves in a programming language rather than the paper-crayon language. And you can name these concepts: (i) statement (makes the computer do something for you instead of doing it yourself); (ii) script/program (sequence of statements executed in top-down order) , and so on. I'm not suggesting that you rename ""Motion: Move and Turn"" to something fancy involving the term statement, but I do suggest to add a paragraph for the teacher where you make the concepts taught in every exploration explicit. In Exploration 1, it's exactly (i) and (ii) above (snapping statements together to form a script). Thanks again for sharing this resource! Best, Bernd."
2429,A New Resource for teaching Scratch to kids ages 5-8,2/1/10 21:27,"Bernd, Thank you for the detailed feedback! I found some of your questions very helpful while refining my resource. I hope I can help with your concern about ""getting the fish moving.""  When you are starting in Scratch, make it clear that the goal is to make the computer do things for you.  The goal is to make the computer do what you want. I think if you take on the challenge of teaching kids ages 5-8 that they are more than capable of grasping many difficult programming concepts.  Even those students that lack basic reading skills might surprise you with their skills and understanding in Scratch. I hope that you find my soon to come revision of the resource helpful. Good luck in your Scratch endeavors! - Crystal"
2429,A New Resource for teaching Scratch to kids ages 5-8,2/3/10 0:38,"Excellent suggestions, these changes will help reach this age of students and their teachers."
2429,A New Resource for teaching Scratch to kids ages 5-8,2/7/10 14:58,"This is a great resource Crystal. It will be very well received by the teachers in my school. I introduced Scratch in school as part of a child - led topic week  during the first week back in January. Like you the first consideration for me was the vocabulary that the children would use. Amazing how quickly newly introduced terms become part of their retained vocabulary! As the children had never come across anything like this before, the first activity I did was to give them a sheet of printed out commands from each of the blocks (a bit like lego building blocks). In the hall we then acted out the role of the sprite (which was only allowed to follow the commands they were holding). All the group were familiar with paint and I didn't need to tell them how to create sprites or stages, they just experimented. I think that is where their generation benefits... they have no fear of technology... unlike the teachers who currently know less than the pupils - so I will be distributing your resource in the hope they feel more confident working with it in class. I am hoping to get some students entering the schools computer animation awards (UK) I enjoy using Scratch as a teaching tool. Although I have not been using it for long I can quickly create animations and games targeted at bridging gaps in their learning."
2429,A New Resource for teaching Scratch to kids ages 5-8,2/17/10 8:16,"Hi Crystal This is terrific. I really like the way you have tried to incorporate language and vocabulary. I work with young children who have a hearing loss -- but we don't use sign language and I teach them to listen and speak. They are usually learning language and I use scratch to help make language concepts clear, but also to help them recognize the representation of these language concepts in different ways. e.g. the use of 'when', while and ""if..""  syntax in english. I am currently trying to match some of the scratch commands with english syntactical structures and examples. Your project really is on that track and extremely useful for young children!  Hope you continue elaborating on the project. Maybe examples of social studies and science material , associated language and how it can be taught using scratch. Thanks again for your work!!"
2429,A New Resource for teaching Scratch to kids ages 5-8,7/1/10 6:43,"Fantastic! I agree with the comment about adding time markers. Getting young kids engaged in Scratch seems always to involve helping them to finish a short project quickly. Maybe build in the notion of ""versions."" So after a few steps, they finish and we congratulate them, but then we say, ""How about we go for Version #2?"" That's another element of the modern design process taught! Thanks! -Chris-"

We created our own Scratch game and so did students at a near by school and we posted them on a board and we played each other's games!

8153,A pedagogical thought about Sprites and direction,11/12/10 10:03,"Today I started to think about a Scratchsession for the next week. Easy ways to learn and so on... But then I came across this little confusing topic with a Sprite and it´s directions... I mean I understand it, but... I draw naturally a Sprite with direction pointing upwards (my little bug). But when I use direction in my script the direction must be 90. Isn´t it more natural to think 0 was pointing upwards. No big deal, but when you explane to the children, when they are going to move this little bug and face the bug to the right, and left and so on... it starts to be a little bit confusing. If the bug is going up direction is 90 (right), and if it´s down -90 (left)... Maybe I am missing something obvious... And the Snow we got yesterday... is melting, raining today. So it might be natural with up to the right and down to the left... ;) Have a nice weekend, Anders"
8153,A pedagogical thought about Sprites and direction,11/14/10 20:03,"Yah, I don't like how the directions were implemented at all. According to Scratch 90 is right -90 is left 180 is down 0 is up but I don't quite understand why that makes sense or why it was choosen that way. It is like the whole system was rotated 90 degress to the left"
8153,A pedagogical thought about Sprites and direction,11/15/10 3:02,"Yes, you are totally right. It might be something about western world of thinking. Everything (text) from left to right. I understand and accept 0 as being up (the circle starts from 0 up). But when I make a Sprite it´s not that easy... So is it a bug or something I really don´t understand."
8153,A pedagogical thought about Sprites and direction,11/15/10 14:48,"Right, so no matter what the image looks like .. the initial position of it is set to 90. To help with confusing students I guess I would suggest always drawing their sprites to face right. I don't think this is a bug -- I think this is how Scratch intended it, but I sure don't like it."
8153,A pedagogical thought about Sprites and direction,12/2/10 19:36,"Greetings from a one hour newbie... I am starting ""from Scratch"" literally and technologically... and just began following your discussion which is a great lesson for me... thank you very much... So let me see if I understand what you all are saying here: I love geometry by the way... :-) and at this very moment I am looking at a student protractor (I still draw with a pencil and paint on canvas...) The protractor, based similarly to the X and Y axes of traditional Graphs in Math, puts zero degrees at 9 o'clock, 90 degrees at 12 o'clock and 180 degrees at 3 o'clock... So what you all are saying is that Scratch puts a value of zero at the 90 degree mark/angle of/on a protractor? ...in terms of Movement/Motion direction of the Sprite...? That is plenty for me to ask right now... and appreciate any reply/confirmation of my ""description""/""analysis"" of what you are saying...

22376,A STEM Camp Success Story,9/12/13 20:37,"Hello Scratch Community! Last summer I had the privelege of teaching a 2-day game design course to a room full of approximately 25 6th graders.  Not knowing how in the world I could possibly teach anything worth while in 2 half-day sessions, I turned to an online forum where several people recommended the Scratch programming environment.  Not only was Scratch easy for me as an instructor to pick up and learn, but the wealth of resources on the education site made it easy to find material to present to the class.  What I really wanted to avoid was spending 2 hours hunting down a missing semicolon (which is likely what would have happened if I went with a more ""traditional"" programming language). As a relatively new educator in a rural community, it was a very gratifying experience to get young people excited about Computer Science through game design.  I even had students come to me saying that they didn't want to go to their next sessions so they could stay and work on their Scratch projects.  I'm very proud of my group of budding computer scientists and look forward to investigating new ways of using Scratch inside and outside the classroom!

On my home iMac I refrained from upgrading Sctach 2.0 and everything works fine including the WeDo extension and the Wedo extension on the online version. As an aside the WeDo extension in the Scratch 2.0 web version didn't work but did on my laptop. So I conclude that the Scratch 2.0 off line iupdate must have caused these errors. Thanks for any help."
38979,Adobe AIR native extension missing,12/21/15 8:47,Problem all solved courtesy of Scratch team. Adobe AIR 20 was the culprit. Don't upgrade to Adobe AIR 20. Stay with version 19.
38979,Adobe AIR native extension missing,12/15/15 21:18,I think the problem is with Adobe Air. I declined Scratch 2.0 on my iMac but accepted the Adobe AIR update. Then I got the same error message when Scratch 2.0 offline loaded. SO it must be an Adobe AIR problem. Sorry about the conclusion that Scratch 2.0 was the culprit!
41675,Adult Education and Learner Autonomy,4/12/16 13:38,"Dears colleagues, What do you think about how to develop learner autonomy in adult education? I am teaching a workshop about Scratch and programming language and the idea is to analyse how students develop their learner autonomy with the platform.. Do you have some ideas?"
15643,Adult learners,1/1/13 15:46,I'm going to start the second term of my after school club about creative programming. I wonder if it is possible to involve also some parents in the programming course. Have you had any experience about it ? Do you think adults could be engaged in learning programming ? Thank you very much.
15643,Adult learners,1/4/13 8:47,"Of course adults can learn programming!  But probably not all parents of those at your club will be interested. I ran a 10-week after-school Computer Club for 8/9-year-olds last term, based wholly on Scratch.  For weeks 5 and 10, I asked the children to invite their parents (or family or carers) to come too, so they could show them what they had been doing.  Some parents couldn't and some didn't, but many did.  At least one earned a living from IT, several were quite unfamiliar with computers, and there were all shades in between. You might find parents interested to join in learning with their offspring, or parents able to volunteer to help others learn.  At a practical level, the offspring might have strong views on whether their parents should be involved, and of course adults may need some form of clearance before being able to learn or work with children. A first step might be to run a one-off open session as a taster.  Good luck with whatever you decide to try!"

I believe that Scratch is not only a terrific learning environment it is also a great tool to demonstrate the advantages of computer programming to educators. For example, just as Scratch demonstrates to the user why variables are useful in a concrete way, Scratch demonstrates to administrators and educators what computer programming can offer. I would like to solicit help and advice on how to help promote the integration of computer programming into the k-12 curriculum. Thanks again for all help, Vicki Gold"

8486,Advocating for Computer Programming in K-12 Curriculum,11/30/10 14:11,"Hello Vicki, I too am interested in teaching CS in K-12. I have been programming since 1980 but lack a background in education. I've found it very frustrating, this apparent lack of interest in the public schools to teach CS. I looked into an M. Ed. in Secondary Education program at my alma mater, West Chester University, and CS is not even an approved concentration area. But they do offer a Level I Post Baccalaureate Teacher Certification Program – Elementary Education, with a concentration for grades 4-8. So I need to get my teaching credentials first, and then I will have this uphill battle which is the subject of your blog. I have joined the CSTA but they are focused on public education, so I either need to get into the public school system or just teach this subject through workshops or one-on-one tutoring. But the good news is I've discovered Scratch. I'm now writing my first program with it, which is the game Reversi. This was actually the same game I used to learn programming back in 1980, using assembly language on an Atari computer. I think it will be a good test of Scratch's capabilities. I'll let you know how it goes. I hope there is some more discussion of this very important subject you've brought up here. Steve Williams"
8486,Advocating for Computer Programming in K-12 Curriculum,1/25/12 20:30,"Look at the advocacy page on the ISTE site. http://www.iste.org/about-iste/advocacy.aspx Also, look into papers published in association with STEM http://www.stemeducation.com/ and use these to build support with local and state boards (if you are in the USA). One more suggestion-if you are in the USA, join your state educational technology association to receive publications and local support.(Go to the conference if possible.)  Find out which endoresements, if any,  are required to teach Technology in your state."
9410,Advocating for Scratch,3/27/11 11:27,"I had the pleasure of sitting in on the monthly Scratch professional learning community that was spearheaded by Karen Randall. (You can check out notes from prior meetings on ScratchEd here, here, and here.) Many interesting threads were explored, but one that I thought would be particularly interesting to bring to ScratchEd is around advocacy, as raised by Patrice Gans. That is, if you're excited about Scratch, how do you help others understand that excitement and express what young people get out of participating? One path is to talk with young people and see how they describe about what they're doing: What do the young people you work with say about their Scratch experiences? How could those reflections help advocate for Scratch?"
9410,Advocating for Scratch,3/27/11 13:07,"In this conversation, Karen made the excellent point that while Scratch is a cool thing on its own, its advocacy is about more than introducing students to computer programming. I am wondering if anyone has put together supportive reasearch, summary papers, or proposals in advocating for Scratch with district decision makers, including the thinking, creating, and self-motivated learning aspects.   If so, would you be willing to share them here? Frank Sabaté explained his success in supporting Scratch around Barlcelona, Spain this way:  ""I talk to people.""  At what sorts of organizations, conference or meeting sessions have people shared Scratch?  Where should we as teachers be sure that Scratch is on the agenda?"
9410,Advocating for Scratch,3/29/11 4:49,"I am interested in creating a Scratch Computer Programming advocacy group. I believe it would help when speaking with school officials.  Perhaps a loosely formed group that believes in promoting computer programming through the use of Scratch in  the K-12 curriculum. Please respond if you are interested. Thanks, Vicki Gold"
9410,Advocating for Scratch,3/30/11 7:40,Last week for some unknown reason the department of education in Queensland Australia blocked the Scratch site to students. Getting an explanation is impossible but I'll wager a strong message from the Scratch team might wake them up. Kids I teach in Special Education are flabbergasted.
9410,Advocating for Scratch,3/30/11 21:38,"I am definitely very interested in furthering the goal of promoting computer programming in K-12 education.  I would be happy to participate in any advocacy group. I am currently a member of CSTA (Computer Science Teachers Assocation  http://csta.acm.org/ ), whoes main goal is to promote the teaching of computer science (in K-12).  I am presently running for a position on the board as the K-8 representative. I believe that computer science, which is at the core of the development of new technologies, should be taught to all students. Teaching computer science is essential to the development of critical thinking and problem solving skills. Computers are an integral part of life in the 21st century, and our schools have an obligation to prepare our students for the future. Traditionally, students are first exposed to computer science in high school as part of an AP computer science class. However, I believe it is extremely important to grab students’ attention long before their first AP course. Consequently, I believe that the age which students are taught critical computer skills is an important issue.  It seems that Scratch would  be the ideal avenue for introducing younger students to basic programming concepts while at the same time igniting their curiosity and imagination. In regards to advocacy, the first step would be to push for legislation that requires computer skills in the k-12 curriculum.  A bill had been proposed, The Computer Science Education Act (of 2010), http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h111-5929, but did not make past committee.  I believe a more united effort is needed for this to come to fruition.  Lets work together to make this happen for our students and our schools."

9410,Advocating for Scratch,4/2/11 20:23,"I feel that Scratch is a great way of introducing CS into schools.  In Scotland the education system has for a good few years now always had some form of computing on the curriculum.  Until the recent change it was the 5-14 curriculum and this for part had use of Logo to teach children about control etc.   Now there has been a change and the new curriculum still mentions to an extent control but moreso there is a specific CS element of it,which incorporates playing games through to making games http://www.ltscotland.org.uk/learningteachingandassessment/curriculumareas/technologies/eandos/index.asp I am now looking at getting more schools on board with Scratch through my PhD and primary school children's learning."
9410,Advocating for Scratch,5/1/11 6:48,"Since Karen Randall has decided to end her participation in the monthly ScratchPLC meetings, Patrice Gans and I thought this might be the perfect time to see if the group would be interested in taking on more of a community activist role. The group would be comprised of like-minded educators whose goal is to effect change on the grass roots level to promote computer programming in the K-12 curriculum, in after-school programs, and in the home. As a whole, we do not have to be a homogeneous group to be effective; we can come from different perspectives, have different agendas, and have different teaching and learning styles. What we will have in common is a desire to promote the use of Scratch as a means by which to facilitate substantive changes to the approach to how we teach 21st Century skills.

39436,Announcing a New Framework to Define K-12 Computer Science Education,1/8/16 16:17,"The original post can be found on the k12cs blog. Computing Leaders ACM, Code.org, and CSTA Launch Effort to Guide Educators and State and District Policy Makers About K-12 Computer Science For most states and school districts, the notion of computer science for every student is a relatively new and unexplored topic. Responding to parent demand for their children to have access to computer science, there’s been a major shift in thinking by states and school districts about how to make computer science part of core academic work. They are asking big questions of the computing community: What is the appropriate scope and sequence for K-12 computer science? What does the community expect every student to learn in elementary school, in middle school, or by the time they graduate high school? And why? CSTA, ACM, and Code.org are joining forces with more than 100 advisors within the computing community (higher ed faculty, researchers, and K-12 teachers, many of whom are also serving as writers for the framework), several states and large school districts, technology companies, and other organizations to steer a process to build a framework to help answer these questions. A steering committee initially comprised of the Computer Science Teachers Association, the Association for Computing Machinery, and Code.org will oversee this project. The framework will identify key K-12 computer science concepts and practices we expect students exiting grades 2, 5, 8, and 12 to know. This effort will not develop educational standards. We expect that states and school districts will use the framework to create their own frameworks, guidance, and standards, and the CSTA has its own independent process for developing detailed K-12 computer science standards. Underpinning this effort is our belief that computer science provides foundational learning benefiting every child. Computer science gives students a set of essential knowledge and skills important for students’ learning and for their future careers and interests. This work is about defining the basic expectations for what every student should have a chance to learn about K-12 computer science to prepare for the emerging demands of the 21st century — not just to major in computer science or secure jobs as software engineers. The projected release date for the framework is summer 2016. More information, including monthly updates and how to get involved, can be found at K12CS.org.

20891,Another question about turning in assignments,8/6/13 23:03,"When teaching Python or Java, I always have students submit their programs electronically (so that I could run the programs) and turn in printouts of their source code and output. Having the hardcopy makes it easier for me to grade and give feedback, particularly since I can mark directly on the code and point out both good and bad points in the student's work. With Scratch, getting hardcopy is a little more complicated, but certain screenshots can be submitted. I was just wondering if anyone else does this with Scratch, and how it has worked? With each sprite having its own script, it could get a little complicated to make sure that everything is included. Thanks in advance for any thoughts or advice you can give!"
59757,Any ideas on how to contact someone about changing my password to my scratch teacher account,11/19/18 16:03,"Hi, I feel stupid asking for this but I use Scratch for my Intro class and am having a problem accessing my teacher account.  I have done password resets, looked in spam, etc.  but I get no emails.  I also have emailed their help contact and teacher account contact multiple times.  I think email from their site may be blocked on my school’s end. Anyhow I was wondering if anyone  had a contact at MIT for someone they know who works in the Scratch project who I could contact to help.  If so please email me at barront@fpsct.org Thank you much!!!"

We go from pre-k to 8 (i'm mostly a math teacher so I look for is to intersect the comp sci and the math for the benefit of both). This year I'm teaching to 2nd and 5th grade but I expect next year I'll be back with my 12:1:1 class, which I had last year and they were 6th graders who always came to school early so they could get some extra time on scratch. I would LOVE to meetup or online meetup and with all these new standards and tests and such, we really have an opportunity to find those places where we can align scratch lessons to the CCLS (although I'm not wild on that whole concept...but that's another story...) This is my 7th year teaching and I've rarely seen my struggling students get so into problem solving while expressing their creative side, no matter the grade level."

They have Internet and everything coporate style. As an alumn I think they'll let me use the space (I also voluntered for them a bunch and know some folks in the office). It's a very central location I'd be happy to inquire about whether they'd let us in a conference room and I'm aiming for either Saturday or Sunday. Whoever wants to come is welcome. If you can't make it but still want to be part of the discussion we can skype of use some of the other ridiculously usefull technology which many of our computer labs and classrooms lack the capacity to take full advantage. What does everyone think?

9925,Any Scratch People in Texas?? - Possible meetups,6/9/11 14:33,I was curious if there would be interest in a Texas Scratch Educators Meetup . I know a lot of teachers in Texas attend the Texas Computer Educators Assocation convention every spring in Austin. There have been a few presentations on Scratch but with 7000+ teachers attending - it would be an ideal spot to gather. I am even open to hosting a get together at my campus - I am about 40 miles from a major airport and about 40 from major interstate. I would love to watch others present - but I am also an experienced presenter and hope to learn as well as share. So how about it Texas ........You ready to Scratch?
9925,Any Scratch People in Texas?? - Possible meetups,4/18/12 15:44,"Hello Louis, I'm in Houston. I have not used Scratch yet. I'm actually reading and looking at what educators have been doing with Scratch to see if we (Houston ISD) can use Scratch, and how. Right now it looks like individual (early adopters) teachers take the initiative, but I have not seen entire schools, or school districts incorporating it in a curricular sense. Would be interested in meeting or talking. Regards, Liliana"
9925,Any Scratch People in Texas?? - Possible meetups,4/18/12 23:59,Would be happy to share my 5+ years experiene with Scratch.

2375,Anyone using Linux workstations?,1/21/10 21:14,"I'm working on a potential article for a Linux publication. Just curious, is there anyone who has taught a Scratch workshop or class using Linux-based workstations? Would love to hear from you. Thanks, Mike"

2375,Anyone using Linux workstations?,1/25/10 15:01,"Michael, I'm teaching with, well, my students are learning with Scratch using Ubuntu 9.04. During two years I've been doing a videogame creation workshop (see my profile for more details) running Scratch on WinXP. Now we have moved to Linux and although the main things work fine I'm having some problems: for example, when students switch from presentation mode to the standard, the screen turns grey and there's nothing! So they cannot swith to presentation mode. If you know the solution, please tell me! I still don't know why there is not an official linux version. Anyone knows? Frank"
2375,Anyone using Linux workstations?,1/25/10 21:19,"Frank, the problem you described is caused by Compiz. You have two options: upgrade to the latest version of Compiz (and perhaps Xorg as well) or disable Compiz completely.  There is an official Linux version. We even have a PPA in Launchpad as most Ubuntu packages do :) We do link it from the download page but not so prominently because there are still some issues with it related to sound recording and lack of full support for MIDI. Cheers!"
2375,Anyone using Linux workstations?,1/25/10 21:27,"Hi Frank - There is a beta Linux version of Scratch- you can find instructions for installing it here: http://info.scratch.mit.edu/Linux_installer Perhaps this is the same version you are already using? Unfortunately, there is a problem with compiz in Ubuntu 9.04 which causes the blank window problem when switching from fullscreen back to normal mode. However, if you disable visual effects in Ubuntu, this problem will go away. You can do this via the following menus: System > Preferences > Appearance, select the Visual Effects tab. Choose ""none."" Hope this helps! Re: official version - we'd hoped to have one released by now, but there are numerous kinks still to be worked with Ubuntu's sound subsystem. If you or anyone you know can help, we'd welcome the assistance. There are links to the project / source code on the installer page linked above. Scratch On!"
2375,Anyone using Linux workstations?,1/26/10 5:57,"Yes, Amos. I'm using the beta version and I've tried your solution and IT WORKS! Thanks!!! My students are so happy!! Do you know if the compiz problem is solved in 9.10? Frank"
2375,Anyone using Linux workstations?,1/26/10 8:49,"Great! :) Yes, the compiz problem is solved in Ubuntu 9.10. However, they introduced changes to the sound recording subsystem in 9.10 that broke Scratch's ability to record sounds properly.  (The Ubuntu giveth and the Ubuntu taketh away).  I'm running 9.10 and I'm sorry to say it's a bit of a mess in general. If you are considering upgrading, I might wait until 10.04 is released, unless you have other compelling reasons. 10.4 will be a Long Term Support release- should be more stable.  With any luck, we'll have these issues solved by then! By the way, I'm not certain I compiled the latest version of the Scratch package for Ubuntu 9.04. It includes some fixes for the help menus. I'll try to build a new package later this week - so expect an automatic update from the PPA soon."
2375,Anyone using Linux workstations?,1/26/10 9:09,Thanks Andrés! One of the problems that I have is that I'm very new to Linux  (I don't know what's a PPA). To install the Scratch beta I downloaded de .deb file. I don't know if I did it right... but it works and I've disabled the visual effects and the presentation mode works fine. Thanks again! Frank
2375,Anyone using Linux workstations?,1/26/10 11:04,"PPA stands for Personal Package Archive - it's a way to install a piece of software as well as subscribe to future updates. There's a page that explains how to install a PPA on your system here: https://launchpad.net/+help/soyuz/ppa-sources-list.html Here is the line you'll need to add to your 3rd party software sources: deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/scratch/ppa/ubuntu jaunty main Then open a terminal, and type the following to authenticate the package: sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys 4EA7974E sudo apt-get update Then you can install or update Scratch from your favorite package manager (I like synaptic). Each time we push an updated version, your computer will automagically install it when it looks for updates."
2375,Anyone using Linux workstations?,1/26/10 13:40,"Thanks, Frank. That sounds fun and I think it's interesting that you moved from XP to Ubuntu. I have Scratch installed on 9.10 (Karmic Koala) desktop and netbook remix versions, and it seems to work just fine for me with the exception of the known issues. I only wish I could use my PicoBoard. The webcam support, however, works well. I snap photos of my 2 year old. He likes commenting (babbling) about the image appears on the Scratch stage. Heh. One of the benefits of using Ubuntu is great software packagement management. As Amos recommended, you sould definitely add the Scratch PPA to your package manager (Synaptic) so that you can automatically be notified about updates as they are published. Mike"

Laura Johnson took some notes of the discussion that are shared here: Specifications: - start with one row of blocks and one ball --> have to move the ball to the wall of blocks using the paddle - when the ball hits the blocks – > block has to disappear - 3 choices for triggering disappearance: paint a block in the background and using ""touching"" block sprite hitting sprite coordinates > ball has to change direction - how to simulate the angle that would result in the real world? Questions / Considerations: - how to decide what level of specification to offer students regarding game mechanics? --> dependent on time and level of students - storyboarding / psuedo-flowcharting is helpful to plan game - using this as an advanced Scratch activity, but still providing various levels of challenges within it - pros and cons of showing students the final product (as in, this is what you're aiming for) vs. telling them the specifications and letting them conceptualize it themselves - value in taking time to discuss various approaches to the same problem / set of constraints, are some better than others?

12195,Arbitrarily long integers,3/26/12 12:27,"I'm sorry if this was asked before, but I couldn't find an answer. The offline version of Scratch 1.4 is able to add and multiply integers of arbitrary length; the online players seem to switch to floating-point numbers when some length is exceeded. I'm wondering what the situation will be in the ""all online"" Scratch 2.0. Will arbitrarily long integers still exist in Scratch 2.0? Will they maybe even work online? I'd be happy about any information on this topic. Thanks!"
12195,Arbitrarily long integers,3/29/12 17:46,"Hi, Bernd. Scratch 1.4 was built on top of the Squeak programming system. Squeak supports arbitrary length integers, so Scratch took advantage of that feature. Both the Java-based online Scratch player and the new Flash-based one represent numbers interally as double precision floating point numbers (64-bit). So, unfortunately, the online version of Scratch will no longer support infinite precision integers. Of course, you can continue to use Scratch 1.4 for projects that require infinite precision integers, but people will need to download your projects and play them with Scratch 1.4 to get the correct results; online, they will get floating point approximations, which I realize may be useless in certain kinds of projects (e.g. projects involving large prime numbers such as public key cryptography). Floats have 52-bits of mantissa, so if you stick to working with numbers up to 2^25 or so, you can get exact results. But I realize one would rather not have to think about such implementation details... -- John"

One thing I really liked about Scratch is what you indicate in your last paragraph - one did not have to think about such precision issues, and I could make a nerdy project  (Scrip & Flip) that computes Pi to 10,000 digits with two very simple scripts. On the other hand, most people will never notice the difference, so I guess it's ok."

1786,Are PICOboards the only choice?,12/2/09 6:12,Can anyone please clarify whether it is only the PICOboard that is compatible with Scratch. Any advice/guidance/help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you : - )
1786,Are PICOboards the only choice?,12/2/09 21:32,"Are you thinking of external sensing devices?  As I understand it, the Scratch folks created the interface board you mention, then turned it over to a company to manufacture under the Picoboard name.  Now they also have worked out compatability between the current version of Scratch and the Lego WeDo system.  Karen B. describes that here: http://scratched.media.mit.edu/resources/wedoscratch-miniguide. What sorts of project do you have in mind?  A group of my students had a ball with Picoboards and a parent volunteer, who came in to help them make Scratch-based music.  He had a prototype of a slide guitar/Scratch project they played with over and over. Karen R."
1786,Are PICOboards the only choice?,12/3/09 4:37,Thanks for getting back to me. Yes it is an external sensor board I'm looking for. Basically we have a budget to spend that isn't huge -nothing new there. We are lacking in control technology and I've been looking at the Lego kits to use in conjunction with Scratch. Although Scratchboards went over to Pico' they are only available to buy from the US and they are $50 each - which is pushing things for us as we are a tiny school.  If we need parts or support it is then limiting for us being in the UK. I'm also looking at Go Control software from DataHarvest - I need to be able to use and external sensor for this too. So everything needs to be compatible with the external sensor boards. I'm just trying to make sure we get good value for our money and that I don't leave a can of worms for whomever takes this job over while I'm on maternity leave next year. Hope the above makes sense!
1786,Are PICOboards the only choice?,12/4/09 11:44,"If you are looking for something to link programming and external inputs, it is hard to beat connecting Scratch with either one of these choices.  You can do so much more than with the software side of the inputs, and kids will know the program to use in other contexts without the outside sensors.  I have to add, though, that I haven't used sensor gadgets from other companies to compare. I don't know pricing for WeDos, but choosing where to spend the money, you could consider: WeDo motors are lots of fun, programming movement like animatronics, toys, etc.  Downside is you also need to buy Lego pieces, gears and such. Picoboards have lots of different input options--sound, light, resistance, switch.  They are great for making game controllers, science experimenting, unusual inputs for graphic design projects.  You can use all sorts of found materials in building, no extra purchase needed.  They are pricey, and don't have the motor option for the movement projects kids enjoy."
1786,Are PICOboards the only choice?,12/11/09 11:27,"Is there any pointer or documentation to what or how to do the ""Scratch-based music / prototype of a slide guitar/Scratch project,"" that sounds very interesting and like something that you'd be hard pressed to pry the students off of.  (in a good way...)"
1786,Are PICOboards the only choice?,12/13/09 12:53,"I don't have anything official.  Here's what it involved: Guitar 1.  Understand that one input option for picoboards is measuring resistance in a circuit. 2.  Make a guitar prototype (the parent version was fancy--miniature rock-style body from plywood attached to a fretboard).  Cover the fretboard with a conductive material--he used a thin black spongy material with some metal component new to me.  Make the slide from a film can wrapped in tin foil. 3. Attach wires to the board, can and Sratchboard in a way that moving the can up and down the board will change the length of the circuit and impact the resistance measured. 4. Write a Scratch script that plays sounds at different pitches depending on the resistance variable. Drumpad Same idea, with tinfoil on the drumsticks and the foamy-stuff on the pad.  When the sticks touch the pad, a circuit closed and the Scratch script played the drum sound."

1786,Are PICOboards the only choice?,9/12/10 17:36,"Is there a wiring schematic anywhere of which parts of the USB plug are used by Scratch? I have many old Technic Legos, motors, and sensors from a very old Lego system that connected to the computer (from about 1988 I think). I'd like to be able to adapt them to work with the Scratch software. Is it as simple as figuring out which wire is the hot wire and which is the ground to run a motor? or sensor? Do I need a resistor in the line to keep to much power from being drawn for the motors? I'm very new to Scratch, but everything I've read indicates that tinkering and expanding is welcomed. Is that true for people making their own interfaces? I ordered a WeDo interface, but $50 seems like a lot for what I should be able to build myself so that the plugs from my old Legos will also work."

344,Art and Technology,7/16/09 13:31,In connection with afternoon's session of the Creative Computing workshop.... * How does technology inspire you to think about art in new ways? * How does art inspire you to think about technology in new ways?
344,Art and Technology,7/16/09 16:17,"Technology is another medium to creatively communicate information, beauty, and emotions through Art. Technology allows people to participate and engage in Art. Rosemary"
344,Art and Technology,7/16/09 18:16,"Technology has the ability to allow people who don't think of themselves as talented in the traditional sense of an artist, to create amazing and beautiful pieces with the aid of technological resources. In schools, It can act as an equalizer for those students who don't always shine in the classroom."
344,Art and Technology,7/16/09 21:24,"Technology and art were not traditionally thought of as complementary. When I thought art, I immediately think of paint and museums. When I thought technology, I think of software/hardware/productivity and then gaming, internet and interactive programs. David's projects pointed me in a totally different way. The Nobel Fields was an artist wonder. The technology was the art form that made the historical information pleasurable and intriguing. I was inspired by the Word Well and the Holocaust Museum's interactive participation. I do not consider myself traditionally artistic with paint, although I love to color. I feel that technology medium can level the playing field and make us all ""artists"" in the true sense of the word."
344,Art and Technology,7/16/09 21:46,"Since I'm not really an artist (although I can be creative), technology helps me create works of art. It gives me tools to do things I never imagined.  It empowers me the artist in me. I can be more creative and am able to think about creating in new ways. I can combine media and end up with a product I never imagined. Technology helps express my ideas and thoughts. If I look at art as a starting point and consider how it inspires me to think about technology, I realize that I can interact with works of art -- reinterpret them using technology; I can examine them at a pixel level -- understand technique and mastery; I can explore mathematical relationships -- examine perspective and proportions, etc.; I can use art as a focal point for exploring technology and its tools. If I think about it long enough it seems impossible to separate the two ... like an Escher drawing ... the art inspires technology and the technology inspires art. (The pen draws the hand which draws the pen which draws the ..... )"
344,Art and Technology,7/17/09 16:26,"I am facinated by the connections between mathematical ideas and art. I think technology helps us to see those connections. It is also inspiring to see how technology can be beautiful and the ways that art can inspire technological form and function. To really answer this question I would need to define art and define technology. If technology is any tool, then the creation of any art requires some kind of technology like a pencil or a paintbrush. If I define art as a product of human creativity then everything we have done with Scratch is art - as it has requred a fair amount of creativity on my part to create my projects."
344,Art and Technology,7/17/09 16:33,"Technology has always been part of the art making process! jiove.com/PROCESS/phase2/lascaux_horse.jpg The Lascaux cave painter, whoever he or she was, had to figure out how to make his/her media (mineral-based pigments, carving tools, etc) using whatever materials were available 16,000 years ago. These were state of the art technology at the time. Plaster, marble, bronze, oil paint, photography, motion pictures, and plastics were all ""new media"" once. Now that there are expensive museums full of artworks made with these media, it's easy for us to think of them as more ""real"" or ""serious"" than other kinds of work. I still love working by hand, and I think traditional drawing is a valuable skill to teach students. There are a million ways to combine the traditional and digital arts - for example, you can sketch a pencil drawing, scan it and clean it up in Photoshop, print it out and retrace it in ink, scan it again and color it in Photoshop, then print it out to a high-quality color printer. Or whatever you like. I'm interested in helping students break down the arbitrary division between the physical art object and the digital image."
344,Art and Technology,7/18/09 7:40,"""If technology is any tool, then the creation of any art requires some kind of technology like a pencil or a paintbrush."" from Liz Davis I never thought of art using technology in this way, but this is a great example. Many people think that technology is just about computers (at least my students think that), but you are right that the tools used in art are technology. Scratch can integrate art into the techology class and  I think it can help students who might not think they are good at art have a medium that they can be successful with."
344,Art and Technology,7/18/09 8:12,"Art is generally part of the physical world and its creation involves interacting with or acting on that world, but what makes a particular act  or product art and another not? As technologies expand, the possibilities for art expand. Hopefully, visual design is an important part of engineering and constructing using the technologies at hand (of everything that we create and live with). I agree that there is value and satisfaction in ""traditional"" methods like drawing, but it is great to also see innovation.  As a librarian, I really like the feel of a book, the binding, end-papers, fonts, even the smell-all those tactile qualities.  But I see the value in the playaway and the Kindle, and there value to me would increase if they somehow spoke more to my senses like a book. I see in the media labs we visited, the focus on trying to make the technologies work with the ""human"", sense elements to make the products more appealing.  Bravo."
344,Art and Technology,7/18/09 9:07,I believe that technology does allow access to the discovery of artistic interest and the stimulation of artistic ability. Could Paint or Photoshop late at night in the privacy of your own room be enough to generate the next Picasso or Spielberg?

12898,"Assessing Computational Thinking: A ScratchEd Webinar on Wednesday, May 30 at 7pm EDT",6/1/12 2:31,"Great, talk, sorry I missed the live version, but Memorex is just as good (okay I'm dating myself) Here are some of my initial notes and thoughts: How do you Assess? Damn good question and I LOVED Karen's line: ""Some of the things that are easiest to evaluate are not the things we care about."" The problem is that the things that are easy (ie: quick and inexpensive) and ""fair"" (standarizable across a wide population) to assess are not what I care about. What do I hope kids learning: Certain Habits of Mind that will serve them well in life and make them better citizens. Confidence that they can create things they care about. Help others How to work with others and build a team Explore different ways of Knowing/expressing something Write it in Scratch, JavaScript, programming another person, etc. Balancing Churchill and Twain Never, Never, Never Give Up. - Winston Churchill Try, Try again, then give up. There no sense making a damn fool of yourself - Mark Twain NOTE: I like giving kids conflicting suggestions.  First it forces them to think.  Second, It requires them to look for appropriate balances and realize things are not always black and white. Try understanding “Why it works” (especially after ""hunting and pecking"" until you get an answer) Look for connections Things I look for and questions/comments I ask/make toward this end. How is these two things the same and how are they different? How else could you do this? Do the simplest thing possible to make it work. Then you can refine later. Its okay to make mistakes. I expect mistakes. In fact if you aren’t making mistakes you aren’t trying hard enough. What can you learn from that mistake? Learn from the mistakes of others. You don't have time to make them all yourself. Wow that’s cool, how did you do that? How did you come up with that idea? What did you try that didn’t work? If a student finishes early, ask them to help someone else. Part of this is training them to help in a way, that builds up the other students and tries to question them toward an answer, or provide examples or small pieces of code they can look at and try and figure out. That said, sometimes, doing it for them is appropriate. Make mistakes on purpose and see what happens. Done with text based languages so they can see the error the compiler produces and get a better understanding and appreciation of the error messages. Give them: Wheres the bug problems. Read their code out loud to themselves and imagine/visulize/kineticize (move your hands/body to mimic what the code is doing, good for drawing shapes projects). I tell them reading it out loud helps you slow down and see what your code is really doing, which is often NOT what you want it to do.  (“Do what I meant, Not what I said”) Its okay to copy (re-use and hopefully re-mix) Can you make this a re-usable compoment that you can use in other projects? Should you? How is this like (fill in the blank) and How is it NOT like (fill in the blank) Example 1: Scratch Draft Curricullum comparing programming each other how to Dance with how its like programming in Scratch. Example 2: How are these programs, which all do the same thing, but are written in different languages (one in Scratch, one in Java Script and one in Squeak) similar and different? I also want to comment on the question that came up towards the end How do you encourage kids to be bold? ( and not afraid to ask questions or make mistakes) But that's another post."

47010,Assessment of Learning Computational Concepts in Scratch,1/25/17 12:25,"Hello ScratchEd community! I am a doctoral candidate studying School Psychology at Temple University in Philadelphia, PA. I am conducting a dissertation study using the Creative Computing Curriculum for Scratch with ten to twelve year-old students during the summer of 2017 in an elementary/middle school in West Philadelphia. Among other things, I will be assessing student learning of computational concepts in a debugging task as described by Brennan and Resnick (2012). The design of the study is a randomized control trial, meaning that one group of students will go through the Creative Computing Curriculum in its entirety, while another group of students will attend regularly scheduled daily activities. Following the first group of students, the second group will then go through the Creative Computing Curriculum so that all students involved in the study have the opportunity to learn and engage with Scratch and the activities within the Creative Computing Curriculum. Each group will take a pre-test of their knowledge of computational concepts, which will be language-based and similar to The Fairy Assessment (Werner, Denner, Campe, & Kawamoto, 2012), as well as a post-test that will be comprised of a series of bugged Scratch programs that students will be asked to debug, or add/modify a function or feature. I am wondering if anyone in the ScratchEd community has developed sample Scratch projects with bugs that may be able to be used to test whether or not students understand specific computational concepts, e.g., sequences, loops, parallelism, events, conditionals, and data structures. If so, I would love to hear about how you developed the projects, and if you would be willing to lend the sample projects for use in my dissertation study.

Two suggestions: Regarding #3, one strategy I've heard from educators is to have students use the teacher's email or to create a shared class email (e.g., SchoolNameScratchers@gmail.com). That way, if a student posts any inappropriate content to the Scratch website, you will be notified. Maybe a #4 step would be to create a class list by having students post their username and a password hint in a shared Google Doc, spreadsheet, or using Google Forms, for students who want to find and friend each other or if a student forgets their username/password. Another strategy for keeping usernames/passwords private is to have students write their username and password in individual sealed envelopes that you keep safe unless needed. Thanks, Michelle"

To be honest, I haven't yet explored the site in full as I'm hopefully waiting for the ""student accounts"" to get set up before exploring.  I'm also wondering what would happen if I do move ahead with a workaround (create generic emails for each student) and then educator/student accounts is eventually enabled.  Would there be a good transition to move to those accounts?  Maybe there is an ""ideal workaround"" that is more seamless to transition to the educator/student accounts once enabled?"
25385,automated creation of Scratch accounts?,3/5/15 10:53,"I already use google-IDs to share information. I also have experience with sharing using google-groups (if you share to the email-addres to the group, all members of the group can acces the google-docs folders). In an ideal situation ID/Authentication/authorization management would not be organized by teachers, but teachers could just use the school-assigned IDs. For example: If a school happens to use Google-apps then the 13+ limit is irrelevant and you could share files to groups, and students could share back. I do not think teachers should be asigning all these IDs because they need to keep their own administration of IDs outside of the school's central administration. Students should be connecting at a higher level and teachers should be using existing IDs. Please note that I do not blame anyone for finding workable solutions, but I think it is just easier for teachers and better in the interest of the students to use IDs that are established elsewhere and just used by the teacher. Just my opinion. Yoast"

Thank you in advance. We are very much looking to impletment Scratch into the full school curriculum , as we have gone 1:1 with Chromebooks, not just using Scratch  in my Technology class. Very excited!"
50920,Batch Reset All Classroom Student Passwords,6/26/17 6:21,"Hello Mr. Stone, My technology class is a 12-week course.  Even though we had a set pattern for creating a password, which was: SC + student ID, students still forgot their passwords.  Everyone was assigned the same password during the third trimester.  There were no problems with students accessing each other's accounts. Not the best solution, but it worked."
50920,Batch Reset All Classroom Student Passwords,6/26/17 20:21,"Hi there! The csv feature is only for new accounts; if you try to upload a csv with usernames that have already been created on the site, nothing will happen (it will just show an error on the screen). At this time, the only way to change the passwords is to do it manually. However, in the password change screen, you have two options: to change the password to something specific, or to simply prompt the student upon login to change it themselves - which may be the faster option, if you are doing many of these."
50920,Batch Reset All Classroom Student Passwords,6/27/17 7:35,"Thank you for the replies. I have about 150  to 200 accounts to reset, I'll start plugging away with resetting them.

2588,better sound script for Pico Board sensors,2/9/10 8:36,"Hi. I've been using the Pico boards for some conductivity exercises using the resistors. We've been having fun doing the musical fruit projects and such. The basic script I am using is: play note (resistance-A sensor value) for .02 beats"" inside a forever block. This works OK, but I was wondering if there was a way to have the note play longer while being able to adjust the resistor value at the same time - something like a Theremin, I guess. Thanks."
2588,better sound script for Pico Board sensors,2/10/10 16:25,"Peter: While you can't, as far as I know, change the note value while it is playing, one way to get the same effect is to have three sprites playing the note, where one sprite begins a short time after another one starts. So you essentially have three loops playing at the same time, and you don't hear a noticeable gap. It actually sounds kind of strange and Theremin-like: Sprite 1: When Flag Clicked set instrument to 51 wait 0.33 secs forever play note x for 1 beat Sprite 2: When Flag Clicked set instrument to 51 wait 0.66 secs forever play note x for 1 beat Sprite 3: When Flag Clicked set instrument to 51 forever play note x for 1 beat Where x is of course your sensor input. Hope this helps."
2588,better sound script for Pico Board sensors,2/11/10 12:05,Thanks. That script sounded better. It was fun having 5 computers running it at the same time.
2588,better sound script for Pico Board sensors,2/14/10 17:10,"Peter and Chalk, Have either of you ever tried having kids play around with music and Scratch? Something like: where the kids would play a song as a group and each computer in the room played a different part - or one computer started the song, and then the next computer would pick up where the last one left off? Reading your exchange on creating sounds just gave me the idea.  I haven't done it with Scratch, but it seems like something kids would like. Actually, I tried something similar to this once with kids and logo, and the kids thought what they produced was great, but that was at a time when it seemed easier to impress students with the wonders of technology. But, even then I think it gave them that satisfaction we want kids to get with Scratch, that they can use technology to create and have fun. Please let me know if you do anything in this area of playing around with music."
2588,better sound script for Pico Board sensors,2/16/10 12:51,"Hi Joyce, At Scratch Day last year we had a music workshop which we called ""Scratch Orchestra.""  We experimented with something like what you described.  We had about 30 people, so we divided the room into groups, and each group made a different type of simple instrument with Scratch.  They were all triggered by the keyboard, and each group had a particular note or sound.  Then we experimented with having volunteers come up to the front and conduct the orchestra, by pointing to the groups, or by pointing to big symbols on a whiteboard.  It was fun, and a little cacophonous. A nice thing about it was that it made it possible to do something (kind of) musical with a large group of people in a small amount of time.  With fewer people and more time, I think it would be possible to do a more elaborate Scratch orchestra, with different people playing scratch instruments that made melodies, rhythms and harmonies at the same time."

35286,Blocks and Beyond Workshop; submissions due Fri. 24 Jul. 2015,7/12/15 13:37,"Blocks and Beyond: Lessons and Directions for First Programming Environments A VL/HCC 2015 workshop in Atlanta on Thu., 22 Oct. 2015 Submissions due Fri. 24 Jul. 2015 Call for Participation Scope and Goals Blocks programming environments represent program syntax trees as compositions of visual blocks. This family of tools includes Scratch, Blockly, Code.org's lessons, App Inventor, Snap!, Pencil Code, Alice/Looking Glass, AgentSheets/AgentCubes, etc. They have introduced programming and computational thinking to tens of millions, reaching people of all ages and backgrounds. Despite their popularity, there has been remarkably little research on the usability, effectiveness, or generalizability of affordances from these environments. The goal of this workshop is to begin to distill testable hypotheses from the existing folk knowledge of blocks-based programming environments and identify research questions and partnerships that can legitimize, or discount, pieces of this knowledge. The workshop will bring together educators and researchers with experience in blocks languages, as well as members of the broader VL/HCC community who wish to examine this area more deeply. We seek participants with diverse expertise, including, but not limited to: design of programming environments, instruction with these environments, the learning sciences, data analytics, usability, and more. The workshop will be a generative discussion that sets the stage for future work and collaboration. It will include participant presentations and demonstrations that frame the discussion, followed by reflection on the state of the field and smaller working-group discussion and brainstorming sessions. Suggested Topics for Discussion Who uses blocks programming environments and why? What do they create in these environments, and how satisfied are they with their creations? Which features of blocks environments help or hinder users? How do we know? Which of these features are worth incorporating into more traditional IDEs? What helpful features are missing? How can blocks environments and associated curricular materials be made more accessible to everyone, especially those with disabilities? Can blocks programming appeal to a wider range of interests (e.g., by allowing connections to different types of devices, web services, data sources, etc.)? What are the best ways to introduce programming to novices and to support their progression towards mastery? Do these approaches differ for for learners of computing basics and for makers? What are the conceptual and practical hurdles encountered by novice users of blocks languages when they face the transition to text languages and traditional programming communities? What can be done to reduce these hurdles? How can we best harness online communities to support growth through teaching, motivating, and providing inspiration and feedback? What roles should collaboration play in blocks programming? How can environments support that collaboration? In these environments, what data can be collected, and how can that data be analyzed to determine answers to questions like those above? How can we use data to answer larger scale questions about early experiences with programming? What are the lessons learned (both positive and negative) from creating first programming environments that can be shared with future environment designers? Submission (due 24 Jul 2015) We invite two kinds of submissions: A 1 to 3 page position statement describing an idea or research question related to the design, teaching, or study of blocks programming environments. A paper (up to 6 pages) describing previously unpublished results involving the design, study, or pedagogy of blocks programming environments. All submissions must be made as PDF files to the Easy Chair Blocks and Beyond workshop submission site. Because this workshop will be discussion-based, rather than a mini-conference, the number of presentation/demonstration slots are limited. Authors for whom presentation or demonstration is essential should indicate this in their submission. Important Dates 24 Jul. 2015: Submissions due. 14 Aug. 2015: Author notification. 4 Sep. 2015: Camera ready copies due. 22 Oct. 2015: Workshop in Atlanta. 23 Oct. 2015: Extra day for blocks language developers, researchers, and teachers to interact Workshop Website For more information on the workshop, including a tentative workshop schedule, see the Blocks and Beyond Workshop website.

I am looking forward to teaching Scratch.  I found CSfirst.withgoogle.com for about 8 lessons of game design to get them going.  After that, I will let them build their own game in pairs. Has anyone tried CS first with Google?"
15012,Breakout Session Notes: Facilitating Scratch Professional Development (November 2012 Meetup),11/13/12 22:56,"Notes by Janet Dee from PD for Teachers breakout session at November Meetup Teachers like the workbook/handout: one side has the content and the other side has the Scratch solution They want the mapping from content to tool Need concise workbook for the lesson: it’s a teaching tool Way you do professional development with teachers depends on time, numbers and what is the end goal? Differentiated instruction: Demo of the Scratch program. Very basic Take to the Scratch Site for the possibilities Show the variety of subject areas that can be covered Depends on Time: The one hour thing: introduce Scratch, then get them to start exploring The next part of the challenge: get a character to do a certain amount of movement Next part is to share what you have done One Hour Covers: INTRODUCTION EXPLORATION SHARING REFLECTION Second Hour Covers: Decide area: storytelling, games, simulations Assign specific challenges (Ideas for challenges: take certain blocks and create, take certain sprites and create) Reflect on how it can be used in their discipline: Teacher and tech person need to work together—how do you enable that? Create curriculum in teams over the summer where the teams are content teacher and tech person What is the end goal of the PD? Could you have the content teachers then teach their colleagues, as in Train the Trainer Or is it to have the teachers have one unit that they can implement right away Karen Lang’s presentation at MASSCUE: She got everyone to program together: group coding We will find her presentation on the MASSCUE Ning and share with others She used a sandbox approach ----- Notes by Laura Johnson from the PD discussion at 11/10 meetup if you were holding a 1 hour PD session, what would you include? Focus on tech skills rather than instructional support (i.e. how to use Scratch rather than how to teach Scratch) because -the curriculum guide and Scratch cards are sufficient tools for learning how to incorporate Scratch into the classroom -the PD leader can’t know how Scratch will fit into the curriculum of every teacher in the session, but can instruct everyone how to use the program -however, it is extremely helpful for the leader to be able to offer suggestions on how to adapt the program to use in certain subjects/classroom environments i.e. foreign language, science, etc. -teachers want: -to know what they’re teaching -to appear competent / a manual so they never look like they don’t know something -to know how to assess student work -explicit links from a process to a Scratch block Key components are: 1st hour session -introduction to basic capabilities of the program -exploring the program through samples and hands-on activity -sharing/reflecting on possibilities of use in specific instructional settings 2nd hour session -hands-on challenge -more in depth tech support -context influences what types of things you need to learn within the program -can use context to preselect Scratch blocks/features to explore -building topics based on groups of blocks There needs to be a shift from teacher/expert to responsible facilitator. Scratch is a safe space for this type of shift – kids and teachers are learning the program at the same time Live coding (having Scratch projected on a large screen while doing a group-think/crowd-sourced challenge) is a good way to bring this culture shift into a PD session -PD facilitator can model ways to deal with uncertainty/mistakes while showing how to use the program (Example: Karen Lang – MassCue conference presentation) The format and content of a PD session depends on: Time available School policy: is the PD on something that is being integrated one classroom at a time / on a voluntary basis or something that the administration has mandated for the whole school End goal: should the PD participants be able to complete 1 project with the edtech by the end or be able to use every aspect of the software? -Depends on the participants Most PD leaders want to be able to “light a fire” under more than one teacher at a time – large group sessions are more valuable than 1 on 1 meetings, but it’s harder to customize those interactions Relying on the kids to transfer their knowledge and skills to teachers isn’t enough When you have a PD session with teachers from different subjects the format should be: Demo Overview of Scratch site Samples showing the capability of the program Resources on ScratchEd Manual for initial training to Scratch use guide isn’t used People have different preferences regarding learning how to use the program. Handout Individual exploring Challenges Teachers are like kids in their enthusiasm for the program, but teachers want to get it right, want to understand what’s going on Meta-perspective: want to connect it to the classroom Whose job is it to tie Scratch to the curriculum? Tech person + teacher -it’s a two way street that can move from a lesson plan to Scratch integration or from Scratch capabilities to lesson plan The ideal PD scenario is to work with specialized groups but a secondary way to get to that is following a train the trainer model Teachers create their own specialized groups building off of the first, more general PD sessions and then can focus on tying things to their specific curricular topics ----- Notes by Rupangi Sharma on Scratch PD breakout session at the November 2012 Meetup – Looking at a way to introduce educators who are new to Scratch by reflecting on Karen Lang’s presentation (Karen modeled her presentation at MASSCUE on the CS4HS workshop at MIT Media Lab). Involving the audience of educators by making them program along with the presenter. – Involving them in programming in such a way that they are in the shoes of students and the presenter takes on the role of the educator- so the presentation gives educators a sample of what a classroom involved with programming through Scratch looks like and gets hands- on experience. – We also spoke about how it is necessary to show educators all that is possible with Scratch- showing them the extent to which students can get creative with Scratch. – It was important, we noted, to also make Scratch relevant to educators by showing them how Scratch can be used in their classroom to teach their particular subject, whether it be science, math or performing arts. – We discussed the importance of curriculum guides and resources like the cards but, we pointed out how sometimes the variety of resources available can be overwhelming so it is advisable to point to specific resources that educators who are new to Scratch can use. – The PD group wanted to see Karen Lang’s presentation on the Scratch Ed website"
15013,Breakout Session Notes: Next Steps After Scratch (November 2012 Meetup),11/13/12 23:04,"Notes by Rupangi Sharma from the Next Steps breakout session at the November 2012 Scratch Educator Meetup Pamela spoke eloquently about how it is important to be explicit about the learning objectives and goals that the students will be achieving so that they can measure how much they have learnt, on their own and get excited by their progress when they see it happen. We discussed Scratch and how it is often seen as a stepping stone to other programming languages and stressed the importance of recognizing Scratch as a programming language that holds its own because it has a lot of capabilities. ----- Notes by Laura Johnson Pam – inherited a curriculum that she tweaked and is coming from an AP Computer Science background (more traditional) – has to make a shift from teacher to facilitator; is learning and teaching at the same time à has given her perspective of what her students are going through and the students can point out holes in the curriculum/lessons Processing addresses Scratch’s limitations Why not Python? Colin doesn’t know Python; Processing is what Arduino uses (big in the Maker world) PROBLEMS WITH THE SWITCH Method Syntax Variables Instantiation of objects Scratch is real programming and powerful but doesn’t look like it. Things that prompt students to want to switch Complicated things with sounds Wanted to use the webcam Fiducials? Scratch vs. Processing Flags vs. code Don’t need to code variables vs. coding for variables/heavy usage of variables Blocks vs. code Kids can troubleshoot (syntax errors aren’t a challenge) vs. teachers troubleshoot to find small details Allows for creativity, can work on big picture concepts vs. frustrated by small details in code Scratch 2.0 could fix some of the transition issues Cloning = instantiation Make a block = parameters To make the switch Project done in Scratch and same project done in Processing Parallel teaching – out of comfort zone and then back to Scratch; build up tolerance for frustration"
15011,Breakout Session Notes: Strategies for Supporting Diverse Students (November 2012 Meetup),11/13/12 22:31,"Notes by Karen Brennan from a breakout session hosted at the November 2012 Scratch Educator Meetup Key Question How do we support students who are diverse in their interests and current abilities? Strategies create videos for students, like Colin's Scratch Challenges (http://scratched.media.mit.edu/resources/scratch-challenges-curriculum-beginner-advanced) offer a menu of challenge choices give a general challenge, then giving suggestions for adaptations to individual students build culture of asking a neighbor encourage kids to share their expertise in the classroom respond to the ""I'm done"" by asking the students to add layers give students freedom in process by providing them with a project specification sheet (e.g. needs to have a score, multiple players)"

2180,Bring SCRATCH to Illinois!!!,1/5/10 14:13,"Hi, I am Adam Slade, a graduate student in Public Policy and Adminstration at Northwestern University. I am a researcher for the IIlinois Economic Recovery Commission. This commission was set up so we could make recommendations to improve education to the IL governor. We are thinking of possibly doing a demo of Scratch for IL officials to increase its exposure and as a way to demonstrate how classrooms can use innovative programs in teaching. Is there any input from an educator/school adminstrator perspective about your experiences with Scratch that would be helpful? I have a few guiding questions... ? How it SCRATCH used by students? (in the curriculum, after school, supplementary work?) Are there ways of guiding students in the use of the program you have found helpful? Is there any training that needs to occur in the school to allow SCRATCH to be used? Are there any recommendations for distribution on a macro scale? Are there any adminstrative issues when using/implementing Scratch in school? Is this program of interest to teachers/administrators and do you think it would be well received by teachers from different areas around the state? Any other thoughts? I appreciate any insight you can provide. Thanks a lot!"
2180,Bring SCRATCH to Illinois!!!,1/10/10 0:51,"Hi, I teach in a middle school computer lab in NM. I have taught introduction to programming for many years using Logo. Last year was my first foray into teaching Scratch. This year, I am developing a nine week Moodle course that can be used as a blended, (some are now saying hybrid), course or strictly online. I am a certified Blackboard teacher for the state, but I like developing courses for Moodle as that is what I am used to. Instruction is guided by the CSTA's, (Computer Science Teachers' Association), recommendations for introducing programming to the middle school, focusing on algrorithms and problem solving, (while keeping it interesting to my students). My course is developed around my state's math standards, programming employment standards, and NETS from ISTE. Students will work through a series of PBL lessons and then develop their own PBL. Scratch goes well with labs like mine as an introduction to the career of programming. It would also fit well into Math, Language Arts, and Social Studies, (many projects are story telling). In HS, given more structure than I use, it would be an excellent introduction into a career track. In elementary, it would be a good introduction to logic. It lacks some of the development for Science that StarLogo TNG has, (see Project Guts, I am an after school club leader). Because of my experience conducting a Scratch webinar, I think there will be a group of teachers at each school that could see how Scratch could fit into the curriculum. I hope to present my course to our NM ISTE's conference this spring. Training for teachers could be done in a one day workshop, providing there was other support such as a wiki, online environment, etc. Wiki's are great for developing curriculum. Once students have the basics of using Scratch, its best to turn them loose developing their own projects within a framework the instructor has developed. Basic projects can be suggested to them, but the Instructor needs to become the help desk. Issues for use of Scratch: Would have to be installed on computers using it Headsets w/microphones would be a plus Quality Internet connection required so students/educators could view projects online making sure that the video tutorials are not blocked, etc. Suggested curriculum uses for Scratch would have to be developed for your state's standards I have collected a great set of references and help sites as a matter of developing my course, if you, or someone from the group you are working with wants to know more, let me know.

2180,Bring SCRATCH to Illinois!!!,1/10/10 20:50,"It's great to hear about your interest in using Scratch in classroom activities in Illinois. I talked about Scratch at the Illinois Computing Educators (ICE) conference a couple years ago, and I met lots of teachers doing creative work with Scratch. You might be able to contact some of them through the ICE ning. We've seen Scratch used in many different ways in classrooms. Of course, it is used in some computer-science and information-technology classes. I'm personally most interested in examples where Scratch is integrated into other curriculum areas. We've seen students use Scratch to create reports for social-studies classes, simulations for science classes, and interactive stories for English classes. As students create and share projects in Scratch, they can learn to think creatively, reason systematically, and work collaboratively -- in addition to becoming more actively engaged with particular curriculum content. If you decide you want to learn more about Scratch, you might consider coming to our Scratch@MIT conference in August. Best of luck with your efforts. Mitch Resnick, MIT Scratch Team"

58831,"Broadcast vs. ""when background changes""?",10/22/18 13:49,"I always use broadcasts to make multiple things happen on one event, like when score = 15, broadcast ""level2"". Then when screen and sprites receive ""level2"", things change accordingly (background change, characters hide or show, etc.) However, I've heard that some people just do it all on ""when background changes"". That would be a lot easier, since you don't have to send messages, have all the characters listen for specific messages, etc. I haven't tried it in a few years, but I recall getting unexpected results using this method. And I never got unexpected results from broadcasts. Oh, and I'm using standalone Scratch 1.4 on the Raspberry Pi, if that makes a difference. TIA, Bob Irving Porter-Gaud School Charleston, SC"
58831,"Broadcast vs. ""when background changes""?",10/25/18 15:42,"Hi Bob! This is an interesting question. What types of unexpected results do you get? I wonder if it is a product of the actual approach, or whether it's something with the less updated version of Scratch? Also, have you shared this question in the Teaching with Scratch Facebook Group? We're slowly migrating discussions over to there, and I think you'll find a lot of great support from the educators in the group! Best, Alexa, on behalf of the ScratchEd Team"
58831,"Broadcast vs. ""when background changes""?",10/31/18 10:13,"Thanks for the suggestion. I've signed up for the FB group. The unexpected results were that not everything that I wanted to happen actually happened. For instance -- go to level 2 = change background to level 2 background. Show some new sprites, speed up the old sprites, reset the timer, etc. Everything didn't work exactly as planned. But it always does with the broadcast. As I mentioned, though, I find the broadcast concept a tricky one for students to master. However, sometimes you want a whole bunch of changes to happen (say, when a certain score is reached, a character goes off the screen, etc.) and you DON'T want to change the background. At that point, you really have to use a broadcast. So I'm still pondering best approach. Thanks for the reply."
1183,Broadcasting,10/17/09 22:05,How do you send all sprites back to their original location so that you don't have to manually move them back to their starting point every time you start the scripts?
1183,Broadcasting,10/18/09 7:49,"You have to program all of the start-up conditions (initial position, initial size, initial costume, whatever else) with blocks. For example, if I want the cat to start at position (-134, 61) and then glide to position (0,0), I put a ""go to x y"" block at the top of the stack, then put in a ""glide"" block. After the cat arrives at (0,0), I want that sprite to get bigger, so I put in a loop with a ""change size"" and a short ""wait"". But I also add a ""set size"" to reset the cat's size each time. I put a ""when green flag clicked"" on top of the stack to make it easy to trigger. Here's a picture of the script. I hope that answers your question! K"

Click on Motion. Notice how it defaults with Scratch the cat at position 0,0 (in the center of the screen.) 2) Drag the cat sprite to any new location on the screen. Click on Looks. Click on Motion again. 3) Look in the Motion blocks for ""go to x:( ) y:( )"" and you will see that the values have been updated with the Sprite's current x,y position. Handy!"

I have an after-school group 2x a week in Madrid and in the past we focused on Digital Media. I wanted to use Scratch, so 2nd semester last year this group solely used Scratch. I had 8-12 grade 2-4 students (boys and girls) on Mondays and Wednesdays after school for an hour (some came 1 day a week, some both days each week.) There were a few who came to the lab where we met a few minutes before the official end of the school day they were so eager to get going! It was an amazing experience- collaboration, creativity, fun. I mostly watched and asked about what they were doing after I facilitated the start up. I did post some projects. Most students downloaded the program to use at home and set up their own accounts. Next year, I will hold after school groups 4 days a week- 2 days for grade 1/2 and 2 days for grades 3/4. I plan to intro other tools, programs, projects but also have Scratch available. What I want from the 2 workshops is guided training on how to use the program, ideas for how to use in the classroom and connect with others who may want to collaborate. I'm very much looking forward to it!  -Nancy"

12449,BYOB semantics question,4/15/12 23:09,"Hi all, I've been using BYOB to teach a college level programming course this semester. I focus on using the parts of the language that can be leveraged to do neat things simply. Therefore, dynamic cloning and deletion is attractive. At some point, I showed how you can do just a bit more with dynamic cloning and deletion by using a variable. In particular, I used examples where sprites are dynamically cloned but the variable they all share is updated in some way, so each of the clones can have distinct behaviors based on one, or at most two, variables. I have two questions: 1) Why is sending messages so verbose when it is so fundamental in Smalltalk and that fundamentalness should carry over to BYOB ? Btw, I have just said about all I know of Smalltalk in the last sentence so I may be confused. Would it make more sense to have a dedicated message sending block instead of overloading the ""of"" block in such a way? 2) Why does the ""of"" block have to be in a launch block instead of a report block? launch (the script (set age to 3)) of (clone) results in a clone with its age set correctly to 3. However, report (the script (set age to 3)) of (clone) results in a clone that still shares its age with its parent. I think this is a question about semantics. I'm familiar with all sorts of PL semantics, but I'm pretty confused about BYOB semantics. Thanks for your help. - mulhern"

What exactly are you referring to when you say ""sending messages""? Asking another sprite to run one of its local blocks by using the ""OF"" sensor? Which mechanism would you suggest instead? They did add a few new blocks, so this might be one more that ought to be added. I don't think I am asking another sprite to run one of its blocks. I'm packing up a little bunch of my code and telling another sprite to run that. I'm not sure what I would suggest, but that ""of"" block is awkwardly overloaded and counter-intuitive. If it's the one thing that I have to tell my students, ""yes, this is how it works, it is wierd, you'll just have to roll with it"", then it maybe should be considered to be a candidate for tweeking. Are you able to address the ""It's easy in SmallTalk, why so awkward in Snap!?"" question at all. >> Why does the ""of"" block have to be in a launch block instead of a report block? > If you click on the ""the script (set age to 3)) of (clone)"" script, you will see, as a result, a script. So, by inserting this script inside report, you will just pass this script around, you won't execute it in any way. Instead, by using launch or run, you will ask the clone to actually run this script, so the variable will be really set. I am well aware that the ""the script"" block reifies the code inside it, so it is not necessary to explain that to me. I am quite fond of languages with first class functions and pass them around like mad whenever the opportunity arises. But I'm not inserting the script inside the report or launch block. I'm inserting it inside the ""of"" block. It is the ""of"" block that may be inserted inside a report or launch block as the case may be. The ""of"" block itself is not reified. After some thought, I realize that I have the answer and it's almost obvious. The ""of"" block is executed, because it's an argument to the launch block. The ""of"" block evaluates to the value (the script (set age to 3)). During evaluation the major side effect is that a clone is created. The value of the expression, i.e., the script is passed as an argument to the launch block. Somehow, in the process, this value is tagged as applying to the particular sprite that just got cloned, so when the launch block is executed it executes that script for the cloned sprite. This is not a process I really want to be explaining to my students in the fifth week of class, yet message passing itself is alluring. The ownership of a script is not shown in BYOB in any way. So, if I set the variable f to the result of (the script (set age to 3) of (clone)) and I then click on x to see its value, I see the script, but not the fact that it belongs to the particular sprite that just got cloned. This still means that ""of' is overloaded a little bizarrely, because the code is assigned to the object on the right hand side of the ""of'. That is not the usual meaning of ""of"" and doesn't match up well with the suggested values in the drop down menu, like x-position. I think I would like a single tell block for message passing. Here is an instance of its use. tell clone to (the script (set age to 3)) It is not general, but it is nice and simple. I could, of course, write such a thing myself for when I teach my class next year, but then I would have to make sure my class loaded that particular block all the time,which adds overhead."
12449,BYOB semantics question,4/17/12 12:46,"If I correctly understand your suggestion (in which case I completely agree with you) by creating the tell block you would move the ""of"" to the launch block, that is, instead of launch ((the script (set age to 3)) of (clone)) you would like something link launch (the script (set age to 3)) of (clone) I admit that when you evaluate the of block the reference to the sprite completely disappear. This is not necessary in Scratch (as the result is simpy a value) but if you are able to execute that very result by using a launch/run block, then the reference to the sprite should be somewhere. Currently this is too opaque. To me your proposal is fine. Even if, for my porposes of ""natural"" or ""spontaneous"" programming (that I strongly support), the entire launch block is really too much (and I don't explain it to my students). Indeed, when you think to sprites as real animated entities, you will never have the possibily to impose another sprite to do something. The correct mechanism, at least in my theoretical programming environment, would be sending the sprite a message (hopefully with parameters). If the sprite is willing to accept that request it will be equipped by a suitable ""receive"" block. This is what I would strongly support. Instead, Brian and Jens, that support more powerful and flexible programming languages, immediately refused my view. My goal is the same of yours: if you make it easier to understand (and to me what is closer to the real world is easier) students will learn it sooner and use it better."
12449,BYOB semantics question,4/18/12 2:02,"Hi Anne, thanks for these thoughtful and ""real life"" remarks about the issues you encountered teaching OOP with BYOB. It's very exciting for us that you're pressing ahead in pioneering a college level programming course based on BYOB! I share your concerns in part about overloading the OF block. OTOH instead of sending a textual message which resolves to a method (-name) in the receiver BYOB sends BLOCKS (and scripts). Personally I think that's easier to understand (and to visualize) than having to somehow get a textual handle for blocknames, which would also have to include further (textual) syntax for parameters etc. However, when a sprite sends ""a block"" to another sprite, it sometimes doesn't know whether such a block even exists for the receiver. In a textual language such as Smalltalk this doesn't really matter, because a message is after all just a string, and if it doesn't match with one of the receiver's own or inherited methods the receiver just answers #doesNotUnderstand. In a blocks based language the equivalent to a method name is the ""block shape"" (or block prototype, as we call it), and the equivalent of the method itself is the block's definition body, i.e. the script attached to the prototype's hat block in the block editor. Therefore, in the OF block we're asking the receiving sprite to identify a block ""such as this one"" indicated by one the sender itself knows about. For future versions of SNAP we're considering a more generic way to describe ""block shapes"", so that they can be sent to other sprites even if the sender doesn't already have a similar-looking block itself. Does this all make sense? Oh, one more thing: This way of having to CALL (or RUN/LAUNCH) a block answered by the receiver certainly isn't self explanatory. That's why - foreseeing this difficulty - we put explicit TELL (obj) (action) ASK (obj) FOR (reporter) blocks in our TOOLS sprite. These blocks should be pretty much exactly what you're suggesting, right? We're thinking about always loading them whenever SNAP is launched, but still letting users open a block editor on them so they can demystify message passing for themselves by looking at the - surprisingly simple - implementation code. Do you think this would help you and your students? Thanks! -Jens"
12449,BYOB semantics question,4/18/12 11:33,"I'll take the blame for this one.  My sense of what's elegant doesn't always match that of normal people. :-/ It's exactly right that we were trying to minimize the number of new blocks in the (hopeless) quest to convince the Scratch Team to incorporate our ideas in Scratch 2.0.  And, if you think about just the original Scratch OF block, what it's doing is precisely message passing.  ""X position"" is a message (a text string), and ""Sprite2"" is [the name of, since they're not first class in Scratch] an object. So it seemed most elegant to me, since we were already handed a message passing block, to use that block for all message passing. We added the TELL and ASK blocks to the tool sprite because we quickly learned that other people didn't find the generalized OF as elegant as I still do. :-(  If we provide TELL and ASK on startup, will you mind that they're implemented using OF?  You don't have to teach it to your students. About RUN/LAUNCH vs. CALL, this issue has nothing to do with OOP.  We inherit from Scratch the fact that some blocks report a value, while others don't.  The former are oval or hexagonal; the latter are jigsaw-shaped.  This is why we have THE BLOCK and THE SCRIPT instead of a single lambda, and it's why, correspondingly, you CALL a reporter block but you RUN a script (which might be a single command block).  LAUNCH is just a variant of RUN that starts a new thread, like BROADCAST vs. BROADCAST AND WAIT respectively.  It's convenient to use LAUNCH with message-passing, but you can LAUNCH a new thread within a single sprite. About BYOB vs. Smalltalk, what I think is that part of the genius of Scratch was to finesse the distinction between a procedure and its name -- to a kid, ""the MOVE 10 STEPS block"" and ""the 'MOVE 10 STEPS' block"" mean the same thing.  If you view a message as being the name of a method, this means that in Scratch it's really hard to make a distinction between message and method.  A block is its own name.  Almost all the time, in Scratch, this unproblematically lets kids get on with writing programs without having to think at all about the language semantics.  But in BYOB it sometimes makes it harder to express oneself precisely.  Jens, did I get this right? I note in passing that some Scratch block names are quite long, and you'd get tired of typing ""GLIDE _ SECS TO X: _ Y: _"" as a message after a while.  Using the reified block as its own message /is/ terse and simple, looked at from the right angle. :-) We are about to rethink all this for Snap! because we want to generalize the OOP system to include other kinds of objects, e.g., costumes and sounds.  If we keep the same message passing approach, we'll be overloading the second input of OF as well as the first. Nothing is settled yet.  But we'll certainly provide ASK and TELL (we need both for the same reason as CALL and RUN) on startup."
12449,BYOB semantics question,4/22/12 20:20,"Thanks Jens. I appreciate all the hard work on BYOB/Snap!. It's been a very interesting experience teaching with BYOB and I don't think the class would have been nearly as successful in another language. We switched to Python a few weeks ago and students who had been doing well in BYOB spun out when attempting programs of equal difficulty in Python. Wrestling with syntax seems to get in the way of higher level thinking. I would have liked to continue with BYOB further but I was running out of simple and elegant things that I felt I had a thorough understanding of, so I decided I'ld better switch to another language I had strong opinions on the proper use of before I started to flounder ;> I'll have to spend a little time reflecting on what you've said here before I can give a response.

12449,BYOB semantics question,4/22/12 20:31,Have you then decided to give up on the hopeless quest and make use of the freedom that provides?
12449,BYOB semantics question,4/23/12 13:02,"A qualified yes.  For one thing, we're going to split up the old tool sprite into modules, and one of those subsets will be preloaded when you start Snap!.  So you'll have TELL and ASK (one command, one reporter, sorry) but they'll still be implemented with OF, the basic message passing block.  Another example is that people keep wanting support for various neat hardware accessories, from NXT to Arduino to Knect.  But I don't want to have to keep adding half a dozen primitive blocks whenever a new toy is invented; instead, I want to work out how to design primitive blocks read-from-USB and send-to-USB in terms of which people can write libraries for each device.  We'll probably (although this isn't settled and there are competing design ideas) split CALL WITH INPUTS and CALL WITH INPUT LIST into two blocks instead of squeezing them into one block with a pulldown.  So, yes, you'll see a modest increase in the number of primitives, but you won't see exponential growth. PS:  IANJ, but I'll be at Scratch@MIT and would love to get together about curriculum!"
12449,BYOB semantics question,4/23/12 13:17,"> The ownership of a script is not shown in BYOB in any way. So, if I set the variable f to the result of (the script (set age to 3) of (clone)) and I then click on x to see its value, I see the script, but not the fact that it belongs to the particular sprite that just got cloned. This is an issue we inherit from Scratch, although the difficulties aren't as obtrusive in Scratch. Take the MOVE 10 STEPS block.  To everyone except Jens and John Maloney, this seems to be one universal block.  But in fact that's not how Scratch thinks about it.  Actually each sprite has its own local MOVE 10 STEPS block.  The outward notation would be a better fit to the actual internal mechanism if the block were labelled MOVE SPRITE4 10 STEPS etc.  So, even primitive blocks should really have a mechanism to show which sprite they belong to. As soon as things slow down (""real soon now,"" as we used to say in the MIT Science Fiction Society) we'll design a serious debugger, which will have the ability to display the owner of any block/script, primitive or user-created.  With OOP it's even a little more complicated since a sprite can inherit (share) a block owned by its parent. Even without thinking about objects, a very similar situation arises when we display the text of a procedure to represent the procedure; that leaves out the defining environment, from which the procedure may get access to local state variables (e.g., for a THE SCRIPT inside a custom block).  You just have to allow that the displayed representation of a value may not include every attribute of that value.  When you evaluate an expression whose value is a sprite (in BYOB 3.1), what you see is a speech balloon containing a picture of the sprite's costume.  You don't see its position, or, more importantly, the values of its local variables.  You need a debugger for that."

751,Can Scratch do multi-user game ?,9/7/09 13:03,"In a multi-user game settings, typically each user has its own local state and exchange messages to update its own state.  I am not aware how these can be achieved in Scratch.  Or anyone can share their tricks ? The current programming model in powerful enough that a slight extension to a ""space"" scope should be sufficient to incorporate this capability. On top of ""variable of this sprite"" and ""variable of all sprites"", we add a scope: ""variable of all sprites in this space"". When broadcast a message, we add an option to broadcast to all sprites within the space. The communication among different players VM can happen via P2P or via a hosted message broker Does it make sense ?  Thoughts ? Rgds, Ricky http://horicky.blogspot.com"

2299,Career presentation to 7th graders.,1/14/10 21:53,"Hi, My 7th grade son is taking a career decisions class.  I've been invited to give a presentation about my career.  I'm a computer programmer. I'd like to incorporate Scratch into my presentation; but I don't know what activities would be appropriate for an hour long presentation to 12 and 13 year olds. The teacher said she has several students who are into computers.  Originally, I contemplated demonstrating some simple things with Scratch and giving the kids a link to the Scratch website, so they could try it out on their own.  The teacher, who has taken programming courses, suggested I let the kids type in a program into Windows Notepad.  I told her about Scratch and suggested we use it, instead. So, she downloaded and tried Scratch, and arranged to install Scratch on 26 computers so her class of 33 students could have a hands-on experience with Scratch.  Obviously, there's a world of difference between demonstrating Scratch and leading what is essentially a lab class with Scratch;  I'm somewhat intimidated. I would like to give the kids the basic idea of a step-by-step algorithm with loops.  But, I don't want to make it so complicated that the kids get bogged down or bored.  I'm thinking about leading the kids through Scratch Getting Stated.  I'd be very grateful for any suggestions on good activities for this presentation, comments on what to expect, warnings of problems to be prepared for, etc."
2299,Career presentation to 7th graders.,1/15/10 9:46,"An introductory activity that I've done numerous times is Pass It On, which is described in the Scratch workshop design guide. Basically, I demo creating a story with Scratch: one character who moves a bit and says something, a background, another character arrives and responds to the first character. Then the participants start creating their own stories for five minutes, then they rotate to a new computer and extend the story they find there for five minutes, then rotate and extend one final time. You might also be interested in this thread: How do you introduce Scratch to beginners? I hope that helps -- let us know how it goes!"
2299,Career presentation to 7th graders.,1/27/10 9:19,"Karen, Thanks for the links.  The presentation went well and the kids loved Scratch.  My original idea was to walk the kids through the Scratch Getting Started guide.  After reading the thread, ""How do you introduce Scratch to beginners?"" I changed my approach. Instead of a step-by-step walk through, I decided to demonstrate Scratch quickly and then get out of their way.  On the overhead projector, I demonstrated blocks to move the sprites, turn, and then draw a square.  Then, I showed them a game I wrote in Scratch (without going into detail of how the game worked) to give the kids an idea of what Scratch can do.  Then, we passed out copies of the Scratch Getting Started guide and turned them loose on the computers.    After that, I answered a few questions that came up. Some of the kids followed the Scratch Getting Started guide; but, most of them quickly took off in their own direction.  It was a lot of fun to walk to each work station and see what the kids were doing. The most common question was, “Where is the web site where I can download Scratch.”  I'm glad that I read the thread and changed my approach.  Thanks a bunch. Jeff"

If have tried the first three and uploaded EXE versions of my solutions ..... https://www.dropbox.com/sh/fbrnqg60qytz2sz/COgBWlPRCn Problem 1: Multiplication `a la russe The standard multiplication algorithm taught in elementary schools represents just one of several ways to compute the product of two numbers. A different method, which was known in ancient Egypt and is called multiplication `a la russe, more closely resembles how multiplication is performed in electronic computers. Using this method, we need not refer to (or memorize) the standard multiplication table (which, for any two single-digit numbers, tells us their product). Rather, we need to know how to do four things: add, decrement, double, and halve. Using these four operations, we can characterize multiplication of two positive integers a and b as follows: Develop a program that, given two positive integers, multiplies them according to this method and outputs their product as the sum of numbers obtained during the process. For the example above, this sum is 6 + 12 + 48 + 192 + 384. Input: The first line contains a positive integer n indicating how many instances of the problem are described thereafter. Each of the next n lines contains a pair of positive integers a and b to be multiplied, separated by a space. Output: For each pair a and b given as input, display on a single line the equation a _ b = t1 + t2 + · · · + tr where the ti’s are the elements of the sum obtained by multiplying a and b using multiplication `a la russe. The ti’s should be in ascending order. Resultant output ---------------- 214 * 3 = 6 + 12 + 48 + 192 + 384 1 * 3543 = 3543 3543 * 1 = 1 + 2 + 4 + 16 + 64 + 128 + 256 + 1024 + 2048 134 * 18 = 36 + 72 + 2304"

The main difference I can see is the slight changes in the interface. The sequence of adding the blocks etc, is the same from what I have seen. So yes you can use the version 1.4 of that book with Scratch 2. Hope that helps. Andy"

20444,Class management tool for Scratch,3/8/14 4:17,Where can I find a description of the features of the class management tool?
20444,Class management tool for Scratch,3/8/14 10:59,"This does seem like a dilemma. Most online email services require a child to be 13 to get an account. This is probably due to concerns over the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA). Parents don't have very many good options for getting kids email below age 13 unless they own their own website and control the ability to create email accounts. I am preparing for an online Scratch class that will be delivered through a Webinar primarily directed at homeschool kids, but open to anyone. I had the same concerns with getting kids access to Scratch 2.0 as well. My solution is to use standalone version of Scratch (1.4). The parents can download Scratch 1.4 for the kids. There is no need for an email address for the kids."
20444,Class management tool for Scratch,3/12/14 7:53,"That's great news, Michele. I hope that the Educator accounts don't require the students to have email accounts. marty"
20444,Class management tool for Scratch,3/17/14 16:10,"In talking to Scratch educators working with younger children, I've heard a few different strategies for setting up Scratch accounts: Have students use a teacher's email to create their accounts -- this approach is often even preferred by teachers since notifications of innapropriate behavior on the Scratch website will be sent to the email on file for the account. Set up a class email account -- teachers can create a free class email account using Gmail and have all the students input that email when signing up. Get a parent/guardian to provide an email address -- this can be done by sending a note home about Scratch with the student. As you mentioned, using the downloadable version of Scratch is another option. I think it all depends on your situation and needs."
20444,Class management tool for Scratch,2/17/15 8:53,"Still waiting and eagerly anticipating this. I still hope for the following: 1. Classroom management implies identification/authorization. The only way this is possible without the teachers becoming manual admins for this (which should not be their role), is to use  a login from the school. My suggestiomn would be to allow google-IDs, it will also eliminate problems with age for private accounts. It will also give the freedom to still use private accounts for those that have no school-systems. 2. Preferably storage will be shared in an easily accessible way."

There are so many examples of efficient student managment systems (SLO)out there so many websites we use with our students. I know: all in good time ---but sooner would be so much better! I am having my students set up accounts using my email address and all was working well until today. The last 5 would not go through to my email. I am hoping they eventually come through but until then they cannot share projects with me. Really slows things down. . When I have the ablity to use a database and log in all my students in the site as prep, I save so much precious time. Keep us posted."
20444,Class management tool for Scratch,3/4/15 20:59,"I've supported Scratch in elementary school classrooms for a number of years, and have always been uncomfortable with young children using email for accounts in an open network.  Since I couldn't find a good solution for this, a few of my friends decided to make one. Class Locker is a cloud-based class management tool for K-5 which lets students store and share a wide range of files, including the .sb and .sb2 formats used by Scratch.  While this does require an extra step for students to download from the Scratch Editor then upload to Class Locker, it offers a number of benefits: Class Locker ""student cubbies"" are provisioned by the teacher without the need for student emails. No need to create Scratch accounts for students. Walled garden controlled by teacher so students don't get random posts from people outside the classroom. Scratch projects can be included within a central student portfolio rather than a Scratch-specific silo. Parents can ""subscribe"" to all of their child's projects in one step, and receive project updates by email. If you'd like to take a spin for your classroom, visit classlockers.com and click Teacher, then Teacher Registration to sign up.  Use the Promo Code scratched to enable Scratch files. Let us know what you think.  We'll do our best to make it easy for you to integrate Scratch into the classroom."

20444,Class management tool for Scratch,3/12/15 12:19,"Hi Jack, Since I am not US-Based I'd find your solution hard to sell. I like the integration you have apparently realized already. Personally, I think the burden of having to remember extra accounts (specfically for one puppose, like scratch) is bound to be frought with problems. Scratch itself should allow integration with accounts that schools already have (this would also eliminate 13+ problems). Ideally group-management would be supported too. Google-apps integration would be great, but a moodle-plugin could do the trick too, perhaps? Personally, I'd go for Google in a flash."
20444,Class management tool for Scratch,4/7/15 19:32,I would like to see Google Apps connection as well. My class sign up individually using my email address as the guardian.

I have been working with the same group of students (third graders - age 8 and 9) for about one month.  I have been observing how students learn Scratch without any adult assistance.  (I just finished writing a paper about these observations [a qualitative research study]). My study was very similar to the Hole-in-the-Wall studies conducted in India - http://www.hole-in-the-wall.com/findings.html To my suggestion: The students have just started using the pre-made Scratch cards http://scratched.media.mit.edu/resources/scratch-cards.  I have noticed that many of the students who have Individualized Education Plans (special education students) are having a real hard time distinguishing between the Motion (blue), Looks (purple) Sound (purple shade) and Sensing (light blue) blocks of code.  The shades are too similar for many of them to make choices and they are getting frustrated. Has anyone else found this to be a problem?  If so, is there a way to change the color choices of the blocks of code? The kids love Scratch and I have never seen a group of kids want to learn a program with so much enthusiasm.  I hope that the programmers consider my request."
2192,Code Blocks - color choices are confusing for some kids,1/6/10 15:45,"Interesting observation! One possible explanation: the colors on the printed Scratch cards might not match the colors as they appear on the computer screen. That could make it difficult for kids to find the right category for a block when trying to recreate the script on a Scratch card. Does that seem possible? I realize that your methodology may not allow asking direct questions, but if it does you might put blocks of the troublesome colors on the screen then ask the students to find the category that they came from. My guess is that most non-colorblind students will be able do this fairly easily. Thanks for your report. I'll be curious to hear if others have seen similar problems with the colors. It's great that the kids are so enthusiastic! :-)"
2192,Code Blocks - color choices are confusing for some kids,1/7/10 11:00,"Hi John, Thanks for the response.  You are correct that the cards do not match the shades of block code colors in Scratch.  But the big problem is getting them to see the correct shades of blue and purple while in the program, even if they were not following the card directions."

We wanted to announce it here because it's a great opportunity to give kids motivation to work together to create a project. The only real constraints are that the project has to include three particular sprites and it has to be done as a team of at least 2 people. In addition, there are some dates to pay attention to. Wednesday, Feb. 9, is the deadline for participants to upload a project. The projects will receive constructive comments from the Scratch Design Team, and then everyone will have a chance to revise and polish their projects before the final deadline of Mar. 2. What a great opportunity to get feedback from the Design Team and to encourage kids to revise their work! For myself, I'm leading a small, informal workshop where we'll be doing the Collab Challenge as a focus of the group. It has both new and more experienced youth, and so far the kids seem excited. We hope many people will participate! Deborah"

Breakout EDU is the idea that you are given a number of boxes that are all locked with different kinds of locks (key, combination, 4 letter words, number sequences, etc) and you have clues that you use with others to figure out how to get inside the boxes. (http://www.breakoutedu.com/). It's based on the new 'break out of a room' challenges popping up all over the place; but of course we cannot lock kids in a room so the idea is flipped. Any teachers interested in collaborating? I want to - Think of a storyline/theme involving the Scratch Cat - Animate the scratch cat to introduce the theme/story/clues - design multi-step clues, puzzles and riddles - make use of code blocks that they may be more than novice (clones, string or list operations?) - aim at elementary (grade 4?) level of difficulty Thoughts? /VicTwenty"

6560,Collison Detection Between Sprites,9/17/10 14:24,"I've been using Scratch for 3 years with my Intro and AP comp sci classes. My students and I have noticed really inconsistent collision detection between sprites. For instance, if a program a dragon sprite to bounce off a prince sprite, the dragon doesn't bounce off the prince's edge. Sometimes it appears like the dragon bounces off the prince's centerpoint, or sometimes not at all. Does anyone know the inner workings of Scratch's collision detection? A lot of the time, we've just switched to detect colors as a way to get around this."
6560,Collison Detection Between Sprites,9/18/10 16:04,"There's a couple basic things to check for, just in case your kids haven't found them: The sprite's center of rotation (in the costume editor) in the center? When the sprite are colliding, how many steps they take in a ""move"" block.  If the moves are big, they can pass over the sprite before getting to the command that checks for touching. Karen R."
6560,Collison Detection Between Sprites,9/19/10 20:44,"Hi. I don't know the inner workings of collision detection in Scratch. Just wish to share how we solved a similar problem. In a project (see link below) I was creating, my sprite OOgy refused to stay on the yellow path. My son Timothy,  taught me a way to get round thproblem. He asked me to design the sprite with special contact points. If you take a look at my sprite OOgy in the project  ""The adventures of OOgy"" at http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/aitan/1297995, I had initially designed it without the hat and shoes. I had many problems because OOgy could easily get into the blue parts and refused to stay on the yellow path. So Timothy added in the hat and shoes as contact points and that solved the problem. In this project, we used colours for sensing. I believe that  if you design your sprites with specific contact points,  you will be able to solve your problem. However, if the moves are too many, for example ""move 10 steps"" instead of ""move 1 step"", OOgy is once again able to get off the yellow path.  This is exactly the case as described by Karen above. Ai Boon"
6560,Collison Detection Between Sprites,10/19/10 12:02,"Thanks for the suggestions. I will try multiple contact points. It came up again today with a student who put a shooting element into her game. When the bullet hits the dragon, nothing happens. Only when the bullet the exact center of the dragon does it increment the score. This is a little too sensitive for her game. We tried to change it to sensing the color of the dragon and the results were even worse. I'll see what we can accomplish today. Thanks so much."

14992,Color - Finding out the code numbers,2/15/13 15:00,"Let me first state, all of this is self-taught, so the BYOB gurus may have different (a.k.a. correct) terminology for things.  I am probably not too far off the mark however. If things go wonky that is an opportunity for you to learn the debugger....Throw a debug block at the top of your execution chain and when you run you will be dropped in to the debugger (ok, no fancy breakpoints, inspectors, manipulation, in fact it is a pretty sad little debugger, but it is better than nothing at all!) The button on the left is ""run"" which is basically your ""I'm done button"".  The one on the right with the arrow pointing to a flat line is your ""step into"" and it is your bread and butter (later on you may see a double chevron to the right of that which is your ""step over/out"" which will allow you to jump over blocks you have created, but I do not wish to confuse things so ignore that for now) The arrow pointing to the line is the one we will be using...each time you click it, it will show you a block of code and then it will drill down to the inner most function call/variable... When you reach the inner most value it will show it on the screen twice.  The first time is so you know what block is being evaluated, the second time is after evaluation.  If you click the variables button, it will allow you to inspect local variables by placing your mouse over the variable name in the list and waiting for a little popup with the value inside.  if a value has just been evaluated, at the top there will be a ""report value"" and a mouseover there will give you the evaluated result. It is a little confusing at first when it jumps inside a block you created (like the for loop), but if you play with it a bit you will get comfortable with it.  You can easily follow the flow to determine why your loop is never ending (Did you not use a negative number in your ""change variable by n"" block?) You should be able to see that kind of error here. Good luck! Al"
14992,Color - Finding out the code numbers,2/17/13 14:28,"Thanks again Al- Had fun watching the debugger. The problem I encountered was with the Tutorial Author's use of the ""The Block"" in his video. Quite simply, I could never get it to work using the Call() as described in the video because I FAILED to put the ""repeat until call(test)"" in , just a ""Repeat until (test)"". My Bad :( I used an alternative method for my students that didn't require ""The Block"", and moved on, but backed up and showed them this way also. A minor problem that test subjects in my highschool class encountered was trying to understand exactly what the ""run[action]"" actually did. That helped me to some extent, because I could then explain that the ""Actions"" were going to be all of the commands that would eventually reside inside of the For Loop C-Block that this code generates, and the current value of ""i"" would be passed to those commands upon each iteration. It also gave me a chance to demonstrate what happens if you switch the order of the ""run[action]"" and ""set (i)"" commands. Life is Good, sometimes better if fully understood ;-)"

I worked with an organization that was doing gaming for teens but even they only put together step by step instructions. This curriculum that you put together and the ed community has really enlivened my teaching and has brought out the best in my students! Scott - My students are 14-17.

My question is, what are the opitons for actual commercialization of projects.  It has some interesting potential for just plain creating interactive educational applications.  By this I mean not distributing the project and Scratch, but rather just put the project itself (run only) online. To do this I'd be looking at adding some extensions, such as being able to talk to an LMS so that student activites could be recorded for example.  Not a huge problem given the source is available. I did go through the license notes but I wasn't sure how to interpret them RE: my question."

In the past few years, there has been a growing recognition of the importance of computational thinking for understanding and solving problems in a wide range of contexts, not only in the field of computer science. As young people program and share Scratch projects, they begin to develop as computational thinkers: they learn core computational and mathematical concepts, while also learning important strategies for designing, problem solving, and collaborating. In this second of three webinars focused on computational thinking, we will focus on computational thinking practices (iterative and incremental designing, testing and debugging, remixing and reusing, abstracting and modularizing).

11146,Computer Clubhouse Model with Scratch,11/27/11 20:06,"Hi, I was working on a grant proposal this weekend for a potential after-school workshop that would make use of Scratch. As I requested feedback from colleagues, someone told me about the ""Computer Clubhouse"" project, with which I wasn't familiar. I came to find out that the Computer Clubhouse was begun by Mitch Resnick, which was quite the happy coincidence! Can anyone tell me if there are any Computer Clubhouse (or similar) groups that emphasize Scratch as a/the primary digital tool? Thanks! Larry Gundlach"

I'm looking to start a computer programming tutoring academy for kids in Grades K-12, and am looking at numerous different programs (e.g., Scratch, code.org, code for life, Khan academy, CodeHS, Tynker, codecademy, Code Avengers, Alice, etc.). I'd like to get some feedback and suggestions on 2 things: 1. What are the best programs/curriculums out there to really set kids up for success and give them an advantage with respect to computer programming; and, 2. What programs/curriculums are mpost suitable for the different age and hrade groupos (i.e., K-2, 3-5, 6-8, 9-12)? I'm neither a teac her (although I have taught various courses at various levels), not a programmer (although I have a very basic understandiong of java), so any feedback or suffestions would be greatly appreciated. Thank you ScratchEd! JP"

12050,Concerns about remixing?,3/6/12 15:29,"Awesome ScratchEd intern Vanessa Gennarelli asked me, ""What do educators think about remixing and Scratch? In particular, what concerns do they have about using remixing as a practice in their classrooms?"" I suggested that we ask you here on ScratchEd. Any thoughts would be appreciated!"
12050,Concerns about remixing?,3/8/12 9:46,"Remixing is a great way of augmenting knowledge by analysing and building upon what has been already done by others. Without ""remixes"" (hyperlinks!) the Internet won't be there!"
12050,Concerns about remixing?,3/8/12 13:06,Totally agreed! :) Can you think of anything that would cause people to not want to engage in remixing?
12050,Concerns about remixing?,3/8/12 15:52,"As for using remixing in classroom, educators could think that remixing can be interpreted by students as simply ""copying"" without need to acquire a deeper knowledge of what they copied. It's the teacher's to evaluate how much the student's project is a real evolution of the original project. Sometimes students tend to hide the fact that they started from someone else's project. That is why I'm asking my students to develop Scratch-only projects to present to the discussion for their exams. Even if I explain both Scratch and BYOB, I must rely on the incredibly useful ability of the Scratch website of spotting remixes (something that I do not explain to my students :-) I can immediately understand if a project is not by a student, but I must be able to show to the student the original project otherwise... it would be just my opinion."

12132,Consistently use first person singular in Hat blocks,3/16/12 14:14,"I'ld like to suggest consistently using first person singular in Hat blocks. So, the ""when I receive "" block is great, but the ""when clicked"" block should be the ""when I am clicked block"""
12132,Consistently use first person singular in Hat blocks,3/23/12 10:19,"Hi Anne, I agree with your suggestion to use ""When I am clicked"" in HatBlocks, and in fact that's how I did it in Snap (http://snap.berkeley.edu/run), but now I'm getting unsure about it, because maybe kids will think that the first person ""I"" refers to the *HatBlock* itself rather than (also) to the sprite. What do you think, could this perhaps be an issue?"
12132,Consistently use first person singular in Hat blocks,3/23/12 21:41,"This is an interesting idea and thought; and even more interesting that in Scratch the ""also"" exists and clicking on the block itself executes code that when read makes it seem like it should only execute if the sprite itself is clicked. Sometimes I think I overthink ideas like this, my students tend to adjust pretty quickly to whatever it is as long as they are given experimentation time to understand how it works."
12132,Consistently use first person singular in Hat blocks,3/24/12 17:00,"Hi Jens, I see that you have, which is great. It could be an issue, but one which I suspect students would rapidly get past. My worry about the ""when Sprite1 clicked block"" is that students will not understand that the text is changed to ""when Sprite2 is clicked"" when cloning occurs. That is something that will cause more trouble than the confusion that you are suggesting may occur. How about ""when this sprite is clicked"" and ""when this sprite receives""? That would be consistent and avoid that particular possible confusion. - mulhern"

2986,CrazyTalk type animation using Scratch,3/8/10 15:48,"If anyone has used CrazyTalk animations, you'll know how much fun pupils can get from making videos using it. I have come up with a simple method of simulating this using Scratch by simply taking a character and making a copy of it and then erasing parts of the copy to just leave the mouth. The pupils can then record a narration (or import an Audacity recording that has been altered to change ptich and/or speed) and then play the narration followed by a simple loop to change the fisheye effect of the mouth. It does not give the full effect that you get using CrazyTalk but its not a bad substitution for free and is very easy for pupils to achieve once they've learnt the basics of Scratch. Here is a link to an example made by a pupil http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/SimpleScratch/921551 and here is a modified version with the same effect added to the eyes http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/SimpleScratch/921513 regards Simon"

8655,create invisible hot spots,11/30/10 12:20,This is kind of a hack solution; but instead of having one pond sprite you could have it made up of smaller pond sprites and then when each one is clicked have that animal come in. I attached an example -- hope it helps! pond_example

46007,Creating a studio for my class,11/21/16 11:05,"Hi Marie. My name is Christan Balch - I work on the Scratch Team. I'm sorry to hear you have been having some trouble creating studios. By chance is your language set to French? If so, we have recently discovered a bug that impacts users with their language set to French when creating studios. Might you please try setting your language to English and then attempt to create a studio to see if this helps? (You would only need to switch it to English for the purpose of creating the studio and then you could switch back.) Let me know if this does not help and we can try to work with you to discover what the problem might be. I apologize for any inconvenience this causes you. I hope this helps!"

56230,Creating assets,6/18/18 13:41,"Hi Arthur! Thanks for your question. One great option is to have students generate original assets in the Scratch Paint Editor. Here, a young person demonstrates step-by-step how they have created a character from scratch (no pun intended) in the editor.

19353,Creating Usernames and passwords for a class,6/11/13 8:24,"I am keen to hear what strategies  teachers have been using to setup and track new classes on Scratch 2.0? We've been introducing Scratch to 4th graders for 4-5 years now.  Students save their work to network shares, on which teachers have read-write privileges.  That makes it easy for me to track and evaluate student work. For 2013-2014 I'd like to start using Scratch 2.0.  I am NOT keen to have 4th graders choosing new usernames and passwords for every web-based app they go to.    And even if I could swing that, I am not sure how to track student work. All our students have Google Apps accounts, so using Google Authentication would certainly be a plus for us. Thanks Santosh"

22584,Creating usernames for students,9/20/13 14:35,I am a technology literacy teacher and will be introducing all students (grades 3-5) to Scratch.  Does anyone have suggestions for naming conventions when having students create their Scratch 2.0 accounts?  We would like to be able to identify the students' projects by name as they are added to Studios.  Any and all suggestions are welcome. Thank You!
22584,Creating usernames for students,9/25/13 11:12,"Hi Shad, I think there are different options depending on what you're looking for. Some examples I've seen educators use is a school name + anonymous student number convention such as SchoolName1, SchoolName2, or SchoolName_Student1, SchoolName_Student2. You might also have each student create a profile using their name, for example, SchoolName_StudentName (ie: RydellHigh_MichelleC). Have you considered students creating their own usernames? It be nice if students could design and personalize their own account name, especially if you expect that students might want to continue working on Scratch projects beyond the class. You could then record their Scratch profile names in order to keep track of their work or add them to a class studio. I hope that helps. Sincerely, Michelle Chung, on behalf of the ScratchEd Team"

Now that we're halfway through the event, let's do a mid-point review to help us think about what we've done -- and what we might want to add or change. Think about your initial goal(s). Please respond to the following 2 sets of questions: In what way(s) have you made progress on these goals? What aspects of the workshop have been helpful? What else do you need to achieve the goals you initially set? Have new goals emerged? That is, are there other things that you haven't done or learned or explored yet that you really want to do before the end of the workshop? Sincerely, Karen, on behalf of the Creative Computing organizing team"
10275,Creative Computing 2011 - Mid-point review,7/29/11 8:35,I'm still looking for something in the way of curriculium/lesson plans/projects that I can use to get started in the fall. Additional goal is to build up contacts of others to share stuff with.
10275,Creative Computing 2011 - Mid-point review,7/29/11 8:40,"The Creative Computing Workshop has been everything that was expected and more to this point. I've learned how to employ several features in Scratch that I was not even aware of to this point. Moreover, I've generated ideas of how I might use these to assist students. The hands-on approach to the workshop has been extremely influential in generating ideas to use in the classroom as well as in professional development workshops. They have also provided great approaching to teaching and learning Scratch. New goals have emerged because of the workshop. With the New Jersey Core Curriculum Content Standards set to change in September 2012. I see a clear opportunity to utilize Scratch in achieving new objectives outlined by the state. These goals cannot be fulfilled before the end of the workshop but are certainly worthwhile."
10275,Creative Computing 2011 - Mid-point review,7/29/11 8:41,"I feel that I have completely achieved my goal thus far.  I wanted to become more familiar with Scratch so I could provide professional development for my school district.  I am sure there is so much more to learn, but I feel that I have a good foundation to build upon.  The only thing I might be lacking is more ideas on how to incorporate scratch into other disciplines other than math & computer science. I would really love to learn how to make backgrounds scroll so I could help students create more interactive projects."
10275,Creative Computing 2011 - Mid-point review,7/29/11 8:41,"The most useful thing I have learned so far is the ""broadcast"" block.  This opens up a whole new set of ideas for me that I can use in my class.  This was my primary goal in taking this course. New goals have not really emerged for me.  I would be nice if we can do something with a pico board."
10275,Creative Computing 2011 - Mid-point review,7/29/11 8:42,"A big goal was to get better at Scratch and I do feel stronger.  There is functionality I haven't worked with yet...specifically in the operating and variable blocks.  I need to use them before end of course. I hope to feel clearer about how to incorporate Scratch into a non-technology course (math).  I'm thinking it might be fun to do some problem posing through a Scratch project...might catch their attention.  Also, I hope to use Scratch (if I can get computer lab or cart) the first week of school to develop the habits I want to refer to all year.  Would love a conversation about ways to collaborate with tech staff so some of the early learning takes place outside the content class..."
10275,Creative Computing 2011 - Mid-point review,7/29/11 8:47,I have been able to meet people with the same focus as myself who do things differently. I have learned of other approaches to teaching programming that I can try.
10275,Creative Computing 2011 - Mid-point review,7/29/11 8:48,"I have already met my goal, to learn more about Scracth and learn some new strategies for getting young people excited about computing. All the activities we've done so far are ones I can use with my students and campers. Now I am looking forward to learning more about integrating art with Scratch and playing with the effects. I would also be really interested in playing with the Pico boards and Lego, integrating Scratch with external devices."
10275,Creative Computing 2011 - Mid-point review,7/29/11 8:55,"My original goal was to gain confidence in using Scratch, thus allowing me to work with students and teachers back home. I have made progress in terms of learning more and feeling comfortable in the program. However, I am still looking forward to more Scratch time :) The introduction to each activity has been very helpful for me. I have learned to watch the demos carefully, try new things, and ask questions. One project I loved was the partner/switch work. We started a story, moved over to another, and finished with a third. Very cool idea, lots of benefits. My new goal is to create more than animation. I want to learn how to make my work interactive. Perhaps a game. Maybe today. And gee, maybe I'll think about getting/using a Picoboard like Larry :)"
10275,Creative Computing 2011 - Mid-point review,7/29/11 8:55,I feel like I have accomplished my goal.  I am not very comfortable with programming but this gave me an opportunity to dive in and become more familiar with the language and tools.
10275,Creative Computing 2011 - Mid-point review,7/29/11 8:55,I think my initial goals have been met. I think I can integrate Scratch into my curriculum in a way that will interest students. My new goal will be to see how I can get Scratch to work with Lego robotics kits.
10275,Creative Computing 2011 - Mid-point review,7/29/11 8:55,"One goal was to interact with many different people and share our teaching ideas and experiences. I have truly enjoyed doing that. The shared story activity really helped with that. It's awsome that we have our discussion link so we can continue exchanging ideas with each other. My other goal, (more lofty) is to develop some concrete plans for professional development. I have two ideas I want to work on: 1) to have a workshop (or playshop) in which teachers are encouraged to bring their own children regardless of age and my programming students help me facilitate the experience. My students are already eager to do this with me. I need to get a structure to it. 2) based on what was suggested last night, I wnat to create a project that truly meets our school wide technology standard."
10275,Creative Computing 2011 - Mid-point review,7/29/11 8:56,I've definitely got some materials I can use in my classroom now. The ScratchEd website is a great resource.Thanks for the cards. I've learned a lot about using Scratch through you and my peers. I hope to continue learning more about using Scratch as we continue. Thanks for the opportunity!
10275,Creative Computing 2011 - Mid-point review,7/29/11 8:58,"I like the term ""playshop."""
10275,Creative Computing 2011 - Mid-point review,7/29/11 8:59,I have progressed towards my goals so far - I've learned quite a few new elements of Scratch that open up new possibilities for me.  My goal for the remainder of the session is to collaborate with my colleagues in designing a unit for our 3rd grade.
10275,Creative Computing 2011 - Mid-point review,7/29/11 9:00,"I have definitely become more knowledgeable about Scratch,  I have learned so much about different programming aspects. I like the broadcast function.  I haven't tried the operators yet and I would like to think of more uses for the pen.  I have found the collaboration to be very helpful and inspiring. I am still looking to get more ideas for projects for elementary age kids and how to put together some simple lesson plans."
10275,Creative Computing 2011 - Mid-point review,7/29/11 9:01,"One of my goals was to have an opportunity to interact with other professionals to learn different activities to use with Scratch.  I have learned a great deal up to this point and I plan to continue connecting today and tomorrow. Even though I have been using Scratch in my classroom already, I have learned many new techniques that I wasn't aware of!  Thank you!"
10275,Creative Computing 2011 - Mid-point review,7/29/11 9:01,"I came here to be inspired while I create an entire new K-5 technology curriculum for my district. I am definitely inspired. I am really excited for the breakout sessions as a group of us have been discussing talking about using the WeDo, Mindstorms etc... opening up an entire new world for me."
10275,Creative Computing 2011 - Mid-point review,7/29/11 9:01,"I've definitely deepened my knowledge of the ""workings"" of Scratch through the collaboration and sharing activities.  Beyond that, and perhaps more importantly, I've gotten some terrific ideas for how to embed Scratch into curriculum in meaningful ways AND I've seen some great examples of lessons/activities/ I can do to introduce Computational Thinking to my students.  I feel like I'm definitely on my way to achieving the goals I set the first day. I'm not sure if I can consider this a ""new goal"" or not, but I've changed my perspective on how I think Scratch should be used.  I think I was struggling with the idea of creating projects that were open-ended enough to allow students to work at their strengths and interests, YET have enough rigor to use as assessment.  Now, I am looking at things differently and realize that I don't have to take on so much of the responsibility and I can focus on the process for assessment and allow students to choose content.  I'm still working through this new thought...and look forward to clarifying it even more over the next few days. Sandi"
10275,Creative Computing 2011 - Mid-point review,7/29/11 9:01,"It has been a great workshop! My first goal was meet.  Amazing people doing fantastic work, is what I have seen so far.  One thing I'm taking back into my classroom is the ""role playing"" activity to demonstrate the use of the Broadcast tool.  I can see my students getting into it!"
10275,Creative Computing 2011 - Mid-point review,7/29/11 9:03,"My goal was to learn more about scratch so I would be able to re-work some projects that we have curriculum projects in microworlds, so our older students have an opportunity to become more experienced in scratch.  The chance to connect with other teachers and learn about their uses and wishes for scratch in their classroom is invaluable. I believe both of these goals are being met."
10275,Creative Computing 2011 - Mid-point review,7/29/11 9:09,"I am still working on a personal project that shows students the hurdles that they might encounter in life. The project will show the 3 different ways children and adults approach and handle these  hurdles. I hope to have at least 4 different scenes. There are still a lot of things that I have not used, but that is because I never really used Scratch till this year. I am looking forward to doing more. I feel that i am always trying to catch-up I am teaching this summer and I am anxious to try this out in our summer school/camp for the final weeks of the year. I like the part where I will be able to upload there work as a group."
10275,Creative Computing 2011 - Mid-point review,7/29/11 9:04,"Yes John, I agree. The Broadcast & Receive commands are awesome and helpful!"
10275,Creative Computing 2011 - Mid-point review,7/29/11 9:04,I'm getting a better feel for Scratch every day and enjoy learning new techniques every day. Collaborative atmosphere is helpful and fun.  Thanks! I wonder how Scratch handles such CS ideas as finding the max value in a list or sorting a list of values
10275,Creative Computing 2011 - Mid-point review,7/29/11 9:07,"It's great to have had longer stretches for using Scratch than in the past.  I have a better feel for what it takes to program and this will serve me well in understanding what kids at my school have already been introduced to.  Also, I'm a little more confident in thinking I can better think about integrating into a collaborative project between Art, Tech and Language that already exists.  I'm even thinking about using it in Music class for kids to illustrate form. I would like to learn more about the music portion of Scratch.  From what I've seen so far it doesn't seem intuitive, but I'd love to be proven wrong!"
10275,Creative Computing 2011 - Mid-point review,7/29/11 9:06,The workshop has been extremely informative and fun! I found the style of introducing each session with human volunteers to mirror the goals needed to achieve in programming extremely helpful in solidifying the flow of ideas. I came to this workshop with the hope of getting indepth knowledge of Scratch to use with my Middle School students and I find that along with that I am also learning useful techniques on how to guide students through the process of computational thinking. What I need to do next is put some lesson plans in place for the next academic year.
10275,Creative Computing 2011 - Mid-point review,7/29/11 9:15,"My goal was to be inspired. I've definitely been exposed to some great ideas that will keep me thinking for a while. I've enjoyed the variety of activities: in addition to the specifically Scratch-focused training, I loved the tour and the panel discussion. I would love to hear Mitch, Karen, Michelle and Amanda describe their visions of ""what schools could/should look like,"" and also learn about innovative or ""model"" schools they they are aware of. I'd like us to think ahead about ways for all of the participants and facilitators to continue to collaborate in the future. One suggestion would be to make it easier to identify workshop participants on the ScratchEd site. I also want to make time to learn and explore possibilities with the PicoBoard. I'll probably do this during the independent project time and/or the game time. I agree that ""broadcast/receive"" are very useful commands. I'd be interested to learn about other commands that I may not yet be familiar with. I'm enjoying the opportunity to be here. Larry"
10275,Creative Computing 2011 - Mid-point review,7/29/11 9:09,The modeled learning activities have been helpful in learning both the basics programming steps of Scratch as well as powerful  command like 'broadcast'.  My goal of learning more of the advanced commands (operations and variables) would be helpful. It has been very helpful meeting K-12  teachers from various parts of the country listening to their ideas about using Scratch and education. One new goal is to find out how to 'best' organize a gallery where k-5 students can post work so that it can be viewed or found in quick manner (within a district with multiple schools or within a school with many class sections on a grade level) Your modeling has provided new teaching strategies for me. Thank you.
10275,Creative Computing 2011 - Mid-point review,7/29/11 9:10,"Scratch is a tool that I have wanted to spend some time considering and this workshop has perfectly provided time for this endeavor.  I thoroughly enjoy the format of the conference.  The role play activities are all fun, applicable beyond the Scratch classroom, and are highly likely to appear in various places in my courses, club activities and community outreach. One very clear idea has emerged for me.  I would love to offer an afternoon program using Scratch at my daughter's elementary school. Another clear application of Scratch would be for my school's annual bookday.  On bookday the mission is for faculty, students and invited guests to create an array of workshops centered around the themes of a book chosen by a student and faculty committee.  My computer science club is known for devising creative and fun workshops.  In the past the club has used Alice and Greenfoot for example. My curricular goal of deciding whether Scratch is a good fit for our introductory and middle division programs is also being met.  I am convinced Scratch would be a very effective tool and will encourage the members of my department to adopt Scratch."
10275,Creative Computing 2011 - Mid-point review,7/29/11 9:11,Two of my initial goals were to become more comfortable with Scratch in general and to develop project ideas & resources.  All of these goals have been met.  I'm feeling really excited about bringing these ideas back to my students.  One of my additional goals is to develop an assessment process for an open-ended scratch project.  I am thinking about how I can bring students into the process of deciding what makes a superior quality scratch project by watching projects on the website and then discussing the projects that really stood out and why.  I do want to have my own ideas as well about what my expectations need to be in terms of learning outcomes as well.
10275,Creative Computing 2011 - Mid-point review,7/29/11 9:12,I had a goal of learning enough about Scratch and from other teachers to be able to teach it. I have definitely made a lot of progress on this goal. I'm now hoping to get a pico board to explore the extensions to Scratch.
10275,Creative Computing 2011 - Mid-point review,7/29/11 9:12,"In what way(s) have you made progress on these goals? What aspects of the workshop have been helpful? What else do you need to achieve the goals you initially set? By participating in the hands-on activities, I have been able to think of how I will bring them back to my classroom. Last night's panel discussion introduced me to a new software, Tale Blazers, which I hope I will be able to use. Have new goals emerged? That is, are there other things that you haven't done or learned or explored yet that you really want to do before the end of the workshop? I just want to learn more, more, more..... to bring back.  I am trying to develop my course."
10275,Creative Computing 2011 - Mid-point review,7/29/11 9:13,"So far I have been pleasantly invigorated by all the sharing that the group members are doing.  My goal was to become more proficient in using Scratch.  Yesterday I sat next to Janet and she is far more advanced and was very helpful (also patient). I have gotten lots of good ideas and strategies for dealing with the introduction of technology into my classes.  As an art teacher I mostly deal with hands on manipulation.  I can see Scratch blending in nicely with combining several of the projects I already use.  For example, making a sprite in Illustrator and then using it in Scratch (Illustrator sets the sprite on a transparent background so it works well with Scratch). I found a fantastic example of a scratch project developed by another person in the ScratchEd site called ""Got Art"".  This person has generated a program that draws!  It is fantastic!"
10275,Creative Computing 2011 - Mid-point review,7/29/11 9:13,I have met my goal in that I know that I want to use Scratch in my curriculum for both 8th graders and the Intro to CS course.  I have thoroughly enjoyed learning so much about Scratch in such a short period of time. A second and not expected outcome of the workshop so far is getting ideas for activities to do with my class to introduce lessons.  I really enjoyed the story telling activity and even the way that algorithmic thinking has been play acted in this workshop.  I use role playing in my classroom for concepts such as recursion and sorting and searching.  The workshop has given me additional ideas that I can use for teaching CS in any of my courses. I would like to learn how to make games in Scratch.  I can probably muddle thru it now but I am looking forward to learning how others use Scratch to make games.  My students are very drawn to any language in which they can write games.
10275,Creative Computing 2011 - Mid-point review,7/29/11 9:13,"I feel I have meet my goals to learn more about how to introduce Scratch.  There is no easy way and monitoring students and their needs is a way to learn more. A new goal, I realize I need to focus more on of the more difficult progam techniques to add challenging tasks for the go faster students."
10275,Creative Computing 2011 - Mid-point review,7/29/11 9:13,"I had imagined this workshop to be strictly focused on Scratch programming and so I came here just hoping to see how I can create activities or games with the students in my school.   However, being introduced to the panelists last night and the tour of the MIT lab has made me think of other kinds of possibilities.  I hope to create a write up of all the resources and ideas that have come out of what I learned these days to folks in my professional learning network (PLN).  I think there's a lot of folks that I know that are doing interesting things in their schools and don't know of the wonderful resources coming from MIT.  So my new goal is not only to work in my school with Scratch and what I've learned here, but to spread the wealth of information with my PLN. One thing I would like to do is to continue the digital conversation of sharing tips, tricks, and scratch programming files."
10275,Creative Computing 2011 - Mid-point review,7/29/11 9:15,"My goal was to be able to implement computational thinking and programming into the middle school computer curriculum. I have made progress by being provided with insight on how to use scratch in a more advanced way, as well as ideas for projects and activities. The skits, which I’ve very surprised to admit, were helpful. The skits provided me with ideas on how to illustrate parallelism. No new goals have emerged."
10275,Creative Computing 2011 - Mid-point review,7/29/11 9:15,"My goal was to see how Scratch might fit into my third grade engineering initiative. The implications of using Scratch to help teach the engineering design process are obvious. My new goal is to sort out a framework for teaching a trimester-long unit on engineering with Scratch. How do I balance giving enough support to those that need it without stifling those who will thrive from open-ended projects? I'm thinking about starting with the basics of Scratch, perhaps using those flash cards and a simple starter activity. I'll likely incorporate some of the fun lessons demonstrated over the past couple of days (having kids act out commands as sprites!). That could be followed up with some loosely-defined goals, as we did here. i.e. Make a dance party. Then we can move to a culminating project that is much more open-ended. Maybe kids can make proposals for their projects before beginning. That way I can offer guidance for those who do not have a clear goal yet, while staying out of kids' way if they don't need me. Any suggestions would be fantastic... I'd love to hear your ideas."
10275,Creative Computing 2011 - Mid-point review,7/29/11 9:20,"Hi Larry, I too am very interested in exploring the PicoBoard and how I can use that in conjunction with science.  I would like to be able to recommend using the PicoBoard for the 4th-7th grader science projects. Is this something you would be interested in too?"
10275,Creative Computing 2011 - Mid-point review,7/29/11 9:24,"So I arrived late and haven't had the time to write down what my goals were for Scratch. I want to be able to use Scratch commands seamlessly so that I do not have to constantly debug. What else that has been useful is seeing how others have debugged code that make it easier for me when I come across the same problem. I learned about the ""hide"" and ""show"" functions which have made it 25% easier! My new goals are to see how creative I can really get with Scratch!"
10275,Creative Computing 2011 - Mid-point review,7/29/11 10:36,"My initial goal was to develop some very specific activities to support my classroom content standards, mostly ELA. I've been able to come up with ideas for demonstration/teaching, expression/student creation, and assessment. I still want to explore how Scratch can be used with Lego Mindstorms and also use a Pico board. Also, I have no idea how to use variables or lists."
10275,Creative Computing 2011 - Mid-point review,7/29/11 10:04,"My initial goal was to become more comfortable using Scratch and have a better understanding of it's capabilities. Wow.   Woke up this am with my head exploding with project ideas. Moving forward, I want to be more comfortable using variables. I also wondered if you can imbed a projct within a project."
10275,Creative Computing 2011 - Mid-point review,7/29/11 10:11,"My goals were to feel comfortable enough to share Scratch with my colleagues and students and to look at Scratch with robotics. Through the exercises with and without Scratch I DO feel comfortable to introduce Scratch to help people move forward in their creativity. I realize my goal is to help teachers see how they can integrate technologies, as an educator, that i am comfortable with, and you have provided us with so many tools. I have had some exciting conversations this morning with the people at the peach table about robotics. I believe we are getting together this afternoon to share what we know, what we don't know, and what we want to know."
10275,Creative Computing 2011 - Mid-point review,7/29/11 10:14,"I feel that I am on my way towards accomplishing my goals.  I am happy to have the opportunity to learn with other teachers, to hear what they are doing in their classrooms, their experiences with Scratch and their plans for the future.  I no longer feel that I am alone.  I feel that I have a commuinity of professionals that I can bounce ideas of off,and go to if (and when) I encounter problems. I have also really enjoyed the learning activities that Mitch and Karen have shared with us.  I can't wait to try these out with my students.  They really seem to encourage conversation and thinking, which would be great for my students.  It is amazing how you can learn ""computational thnking skills"" that don't always require using the computer. I also can't wait to work on my own project.  I look foward to the next two days to see what other wonderful new skills I can learn."
10275,Creative Computing 2011 - Mid-point review,7/29/11 10:41,I'd also like to hear about plans for future versions of Scratch--what will be included?
10275,Creative Computing 2011 - Mid-point review,7/30/11 5:33,"Thanks for the class. It has been great. I reached my goal and had the opportunity to talk to other teachers about creating a Scratch advocacy group for elementary students that runs across the curriculum. We have the beginnings of a working plan that we will post. I am looking forward to implementing it. One thought is It would be helpful if the Scratch team could provide us with some names  of administrators or policy types we could contact. My feelings are the more people we can contact the greater the chance of success. Thanks, Vicki"
10275,Creative Computing 2011 - Mid-point review,7/30/11 8:24,"Sally, I feel the same way. This workshop has generated many new ideas to take back to school. I'm enthusiastic about implementing Scratch more in the future."
10275,Creative Computing 2011 - Mid-point review,7/30/11 8:37,"I couldn't agree more Stacy.  I feel that when I walked in her I knew about 1% of scratch and had 0% of methods to integrate into my class.  Now, I truly feel that I can use Scratch efficiently & effectively in my classroom and help other teachers do the same."
10275,Creative Computing 2011 - Mid-point review,7/30/11 8:41,"Maria, I used the List in Scratch to hold a list of words and created a bubble sort. I can show it to you. Paul"
10275,Creative Computing 2011 - Mid-point review,7/30/11 8:55,I agree with Larry about wanting to connect with other participants on ScratchEd. It's been a great few days and it'd be nice to hear how everyone's use of Scratch develops with their students over the next school year and beyond.
10275,Creative Computing 2011 - Mid-point review,7/30/11 9:07,Thanks. I think it fits.
10275,Creative Computing 2011 - Mid-point review,7/30/11 9:07,"Thank you for a wonderful, creative, and information training session.  It was more than I had hoped it to be!  I really enjoy having the mini-sessions yesterday so we could pick what was most meaningful for me. I also am still collecting lesson plan and project ideas."

10277,Creative Computing 2011 - Playing Games,7/30/11 8:48,I'll be teaching Scratch at Spirit of Knowledge Charter School in Worcester this fall. I guarantee that games will be part of it. I'll have the kids post their results to the Scratch website.
10277,Creative Computing 2011 - Playing Games,7/30/11 9:13,I definitely will be using games when I re-write my introduction to programming unit. I think creating a game will be the culminating project. I think most students will really enjoy that type of project and it allows for so much creativity.
10277,Creative Computing 2011 - Playing Games,7/30/11 9:15,I like this.  I am wondering if there are any ways in scratch to create games where you can have more than one player.  This would be really appealing as well.

10272,Creative Computing 2011 - Storytelling strategies,7/30/11 9:32,I've enjoyed reading the comments from the Creative Computing Workshop 2011.  Sometimes groups of students will work on Scratch projects that they want to connect with other student projects.  There are some examples of this on the Clutter link http://clutter.scratch.mit.edu/
10269,"Creative Computing 2011 - Your ""Dance Party"" project creation experience",7/28/11 13:01,"At this morning's session, we developed a list of questions that we could ask computational creators about their project: What was your inspiration for this project? How did you do that? (about a particular aspect of the project) What did you get stuck on? What are you most proud of? What will you do next with your project? Think about a project you've worked on since you arrived -- and respond to one (or several) of these questions in the comments. Sincerely, Karen, on behalf of the Creative Computing organizing team"
10269,"Creative Computing 2011 - Your ""Dance Party"" project creation experience",7/28/11 13:25,"In the Flash Mob project  I wanted to have multiple characters but I wanted them to use the same script. Except for the move to their starting positions, their scripts are the same. I was able to test out one sprite, duplicate it, and then just change it's colors and it's starting position."
10269,"Creative Computing 2011 - Your ""Dance Party"" project creation experience",7/28/11 13:30,"For the dance project, I chose to use two sprites that had multiple poses. I wanted to explore combining the poses to make realistic dance moves. I used the ballerina and played with gravity to have her jump and land gracefully. I used the boy dancer and made him attempt a moonwalk. I got stuck on moving the boy convincingly. Next I would like to record one dancers moves and have another imitate it (like our bossy/bossed exercise)."
10269,"Creative Computing 2011 - Your ""Dance Party"" project creation experience",7/28/11 13:33,"In the Dance Party project, I had a dance contest. Each contestant was identified by A, B or C. The project required the user to press one of the letters to make the contestant dance on the stage.  I used the x/y coordinates to glide the sprite from the original postion to the stage to dance then return to their original position. The contest moderator stated the directions to the audience. A challenge that I had, and still have, I want the sprite to grow when it is on the stage, then return to original size when it returns to original starting position. My challenge is that I don't want the sprite to get too big."
10269,"Creative Computing 2011 - Your ""Dance Party"" project creation experience",7/28/11 13:34,"I also created a flash mob scene, each script was the same but I changed the ""wait"" period on each of them.  After I finished it, my neighbor shared with me that it would have been easier to to use ""broadcast"" tiles.  I learned something new!  :-)"
10269,"Creative Computing 2011 - Your ""Dance Party"" project creation experience",7/28/11 13:35,For this project I created a simple scenario of a ballerina jumping and gliding in a ballet studio.  Next I would like to add several sprites and choreograph a ballet sequence.
10269,"Creative Computing 2011 - Your ""Dance Party"" project creation experience",7/28/11 13:35,"At first I was thinking of a specific piece of music that I thought would need sort of an African scene.  Since I didn't find something satisfactory in the library, I ended up using a desert scene and changed the song to ""Summertime"" sung by Billie Holiday.  My sprite was a grasshopper in the desert and my biggest challenge was timing him to jump at the point in the music where ""fish are jumpin'"" happens.  This happened during the instrumental introduction and my plan was/is to change to a water scene with fish jumping (using mulitple sprites) when the actual lyrics came in."
10269,"Creative Computing 2011 - Your ""Dance Party"" project creation experience",7/28/11 13:37,"In my dance party project I wanted to have two sprites dancing alongside one another.  I got stuck quite a bit. Learning some of the basics such initial variables and switching backgrounds was important. If I were to add onto this project or do it again, I would have the sprites interact more, perhaps in a dance battle rather than simultaneously.  I think using the Broadcast command would allow me to do this."

10269,"Creative Computing 2011 - Your ""Dance Party"" project creation experience",7/28/11 13:37,"I am currently collaborating on a project to introduce the power of Scratch to both teachers and students.  The inspiration for the project came from the idea of forming a computer science advocacy group (using Scratch). I just started the project, so I am still in the design stage of the program.  But I did get the curtains to open up! What I hope to do, is to have words scrawl up on the stage, explain the importance of Scratch and then demonstrate different math skills via the use of manipulatives.... And then who knows. I am finding talking and sharing with other teachers at the workshop to be very inspirational (and at times a tad bit intimidating :) )"
10269,"Creative Computing 2011 - Your ""Dance Party"" project creation experience",7/28/11 13:38,My project was to animate some photos of the swivel chairs we are sitting on.  I am fairly new to Scratch so I got stuck on keeping the sprites where I wanted them to be.  My neighbor was very patient and helpful with my questions.  I learned a lot from her.  Next I would like to trim the music file I have to fit the short animation.  I was inspired by watching the shared animations from the group.
10269,"Creative Computing 2011 - Your ""Dance Party"" project creation experience",7/28/11 13:38,"The inspiration for my project was our location.  Looking at the city and the river reminded me of the song Dirty Water. One obstacle I occurred was finding the song and then downloading it.  Once that was done and it was attached to the stage, I found that it was much too long (3 minutes).  I then had to find an editor, free of course, that would allow me to edit the song to a shorter length. With the new shorter version of the song in place, I then had to readjust the number of “repeats” for each of my sprites so that everything ended at once. This type of project is one that I can see using in my classroom next year."
10269,"Creative Computing 2011 - Your ""Dance Party"" project creation experience",7/28/11 13:39,"For my dance project, I wanted to attempt to draw someone and try to animate a dance move. Since I can't draw, I made a stick figure, but was successful in creating an animation. I initially got stuck on creating another sprite in a different position, but got help from a neighbor on how to use costumes. I wanted to try and synchronize the movements with the music. I was able to do that playing with the wait times between costume changes. Finally, a neighbor suggested I use broadcast to synch the start of the second peice of music between my two sprites. That worked great! Thanks!"
10269,"Creative Computing 2011 - Your ""Dance Party"" project creation experience",7/28/11 13:40,"For my dance project, I did a standard one sprite dance sequence. What I found difficult was making my code more concise. The script window gets cluttered pretty quickly. I tried to use the broadcast and receive feature as a way to create subroutines so I could partition sections of code in a more manageable way. I also had to remember to initialize several attributes of the scene and sprite at the start of the program."
10269,"Creative Computing 2011 - Your ""Dance Party"" project creation experience",7/28/11 13:40,"I am currently building a pong game and I am stuck on bouncing the ball.  This is the most complex component of pong.  Once this is complete, I can add the other features (such as points, player names, animation, etc). Another question I can answer is my inspiration for pong.  When I first started programming in 1996, my professor in college gave us a homework assignment (that's right...I said a homework assignment) to create a fully functional pong using the java programming environment.  I spent approximate 20-30 hours coding and making my pong game.  It looked horrible, but it worked. Thus, I feel that it would be poetic to create a new pong game, with nicer features using scratch."
10269,"Creative Computing 2011 - Your ""Dance Party"" project creation experience",7/28/11 13:40,"In my dance project, I wanted the 2nd character to appear later (about 15 seconds in). I couldn't figure out how to have char2 come into the picture. I learned to use hide and show commands as well as BROADCAST. The broadcast command was with char1. For example, char2 'shows' when char1 asks 'who?' Char2 has to RECEIVE the command. It really makes you think about every little detail, the order of operations, and the logic of 'if' this, 'then' that."
10269,"Creative Computing 2011 - Your ""Dance Party"" project creation experience",7/28/11 13:40,"In ELD Dance Party, I got my background inspiration from looking out the window and seeing  the water of the Charles River with boats sailing by.  I decided to make my dance party on the beach.  I wanted to have a boy and girl sprite that each had multiple costumes that I could utilize.  I am challenged by getting the sound to work exactly as I would like. I wanted each dancer to have their own music to move by but I'm still haven't gotten it to perform as I would like."
10269,"Creative Computing 2011 - Your ""Dance Party"" project creation experience",7/28/11 13:41,"For the dance project I didn' t want a program that people simply watched, but I wanted them to interact with it and have the program respond to their action. I found an existing program sample in Scratch called ""Ocean Music Box"" which had this sort of interaction. I used that program to create a dance project where the sprites can be moved on the screen by the user. The music changes depending on where on the screen the sprites are placed.  I then started working on a new project that uses the pens and would like to incorporate the interactie drawing and the music into one program eventually."
10269,"Creative Computing 2011 - Your ""Dance Party"" project creation experience",7/28/11 13:42,"For my dance project I was trying to recreate the ""Zorba the Greek"" dance. I spent most of my time downloading a program so I could get the music off youtube. When I finally did that, I was able to import the music. If I had more time I would have probably created my own characters with multiple costumes, but I worked with one of the available sprites. I learned how to edit and reflect a sprite so that he could dance in different ways. I then wanted to add in another person and have them holding hands and dancing, but I didn't have time to make the second sprite pose the same. So I was able to accomplish about 1/2 of what I set out to do. I did learn a bunch of new things in the art session!"
10269,"Creative Computing 2011 - Your ""Dance Party"" project creation experience",7/28/11 13:43,"Interactive Boston Skyline Xylophone What was your inspiration for this project? I was impressed yesterday by the view out of our conference room. This morning we were asked to think about Arts-related ideas. Seemed fun to take the image of the skyline and art-ify or music-ify it. How did you do that? (about a particular aspect of the project) I experimented with several ways of triggering the music. In both cases, the taller buildings in the skyline photo are the ""keys"" of a keyboard. My original intent was to have some type of controllable graphic ""pointer"" slide left and right across the buildings (using a PicoBoard). I got a bit stuck at first, so tried an easier version triggered by the mouse pointer. The ""if"" and ""touching _______"" blocks were important to make this work. What did you get stuck on? The PicoBoard version still has some bugs. When the pointer-ball is rolled over a building, it is not triggering a musical note. What are you most proud of? I had a goal to try using the PicoBoard, so this was one attempt. What will you do next with your project? Try to get it working. Ask for some feedback from one of the music educators here. (Who are you again?)"
10269,"Creative Computing 2011 - Your ""Dance Party"" project creation experience",7/28/11 13:43,My neighbor was also helpful in showing me about broadcast!
10269,"Creative Computing 2011 - Your ""Dance Party"" project creation experience",7/28/11 13:50,What are you most proud of? It bothered me how static the sprites looked as I moved them.  I heard someone at another table say something about changing an arm on a sprite and that started me exploring possibilities.  With the help of people at my table (thanks all) I was able to make the dog's ears pop up as he jumped then down again when he dropped back (via a costume change).  Ahhhhh....the endless possibilities! Which brings up a big issue:  I'm a content teacher and somehow I need to keep students' focus on the key content goal of any Scratch projects.  I'm thinking collaboration with the art teacher or other specialists might be a way to deal with this issue.
10269,"Creative Computing 2011 - Your ""Dance Party"" project creation experience",7/28/11 13:49,"My inspiration for my dance project was realistic dance movement in a MTV video style environment.  The project was completed by using two main spriets dancing with a consistently changing background. My biggest challenge was getting the dancers to move in a realistic fashion and this was a matter of coordinating the timing, changing of costumes, and waits. I'm most proud that I was able to accomplish the dance movements somewhat realistically. I wish to continue the dance project. (I actually wrote ""Dance Project"" in my porject ideas this morning). I like the flash mob creation. I want to create sprites and coodinate the movements of the sprites in non dance related environment. The challenge here so far is creating the sprites. At first I thought to create in Photoshop but thought that I should try to create using a medium that my students will have access to. So, I 'm trying to create sprites in Scratch."
10269,"Creative Computing 2011 - Your ""Dance Party"" project creation experience",7/28/11 13:44,"I think my next step is to learn how to remix using how other projects; I'm inspired by what others have done so far using Scratch in the timing of different kinds of motion.  Sadly, yesterday was my first day actually using the application and so as I'm learning more about the higher level functions - I'm curious on what I can do next.  I really want to explore operators, variables, and pen to develop animations or game projects.  The duplication of scripts with other sprites helped me with my beach dance party project. I spent the late part of the morning looking through the projects in the ScratchEd resources area for ideas and its really cool to see the curricular connections.  Besides the fact that Scratch enhances computational thinking - I'm always trying to make the connections to different subject areas."
10269,"Creative Computing 2011 - Your ""Dance Party"" project creation experience",7/28/11 13:44,"I wanted one dancer to do specific moves. Chose the sprite then made 8 costumes by copying,,,editing...and mirror imaging. Worked harder than I had to by not doing those steps in a logical order so I had to make a table to keep track of the moves. Then John presented his project and demo'd the random costume. My ""control-freak"" tendencies were dashed! (I copied the project and changed it to random...looked just as good.) Got stuck on positioning the sprite and making him stay put. Set X works wonders.  I also didn't pick up on the distinction between the costume number and costume name i.e. costume # 1 is dan2. Favorite thing I learned today was the duplicate stamp."

I wanted to do something different - Never had uploaded a song, wanted two things to do something simultaneously, and I wanted some random aspect. Also, I like jungles and monkeys. How did you do that? (about a particular aspect of the project) Found my song on google, downloaded it and uploaded to my project. What did you get stuck on? My song sounded ok off of my desktop but lousy on Scratch. For some reason though, it sounded fine when I uploaded it to the Scratch site. What will you do next with your project? After walking around the room, I am inspired to use pen and sound more. I want to create a Scratch that has the user choose an instrument and then somehow write their name and each letter or position creates a different note. When played, that is what your name sounds like. We'll see..."
10269,"Creative Computing 2011 - Your ""Dance Party"" project creation experience",7/28/11 23:52,What was the inspiration for this project? daning queen & dancing quees2 Just before attending this workshop I ran through the Scratch Tutorials  on the homepage. Along with the themed inspirations of the sessions I added/remix-ed  my  own projects from the ones  created from the tutorials. What are you most proud of...? Yesterday I applied what Rivka taught me (using a go to script) to my new project and to assit a colleague.
10269,"Creative Computing 2011 - Your ""Dance Party"" project creation experience",7/28/11 13:45,The inspiration was to use a number of different sprites on a background.  Each sprite would do something different and maybe interact in some fashion. I got stuck when I started using a sprite which already had scripts insluded.  I thought changing them would be easier than starting from the beginning.  It did work for 1 sprite but was more complicated for the 2nd one.  I learned a lot fixing the 2nd one.  I was proud that I was able to find a way to keep one away from the other by moving sprite 1 to another part of the screen when they got too close.  The next time I will add a 3rd sprite.
10269,"Creative Computing 2011 - Your ""Dance Party"" project creation experience",7/28/11 13:47,"I uploaded my party project. My inspiration for the project was this morning's class demo (I have no previous Scratch experience). I added 4 sprites to a Stage that used the Spotlight-stage as the background.  For each sprite, I included multiple customes to be able to make them dance.  I then set the stage to play music and to broadcast a start message when the space key was pressed.  Each sprite would dance and then broadcast a message for the next sprite.  To the stage, I added the ""when the m key is pressed"" stop all. I was stuck in getting the broadcasting to work correctly for a while. To get it to work, I used a variable as a switch. I am most proud of getting it to work ""just the way that I wanted"" I would like to be able to import my own sound file and also have a message on the stage that instructs the user on using the enter and m keys.   I would like the message to then disappear. This was great fun and I can't wait to use it with the kids!!"
10269,"Creative Computing 2011 - Your ""Dance Party"" project creation experience",7/28/11 13:48,"I wanted to create an interactive dance presentation where the user selected a series of steps simply pressing a key.  The hope is that once you have a multiple of steps saved, then you can make the character dance to any song.  That is future direction of this project."
10269,"Creative Computing 2011 - Your ""Dance Party"" project creation experience",7/28/11 13:49,"Inspiration In my dancing project, I wanted to incorporate multiple spinning sprites. I decided to take a picture of my friend, crop the picture, and make a sprite out of his head.  I then duplicated his his head several times. I placed the sprites in the corners of the project and had them spin into each other. The four sprites came together and created a stick figure that had my friend's head. Then the stick figure began to dance. What are you most proud of? I have been trying to use variables in prior projects but had no success. In this project, I was able to successful incorporate a variable count that allowed me to make all the heads (sprites) disappear at a specifically designed point in the animation. I did not have to rely on timing, which made the animation go much smoother."
10269,"Creative Computing 2011 - Your ""Dance Party"" project creation experience",7/28/11 13:56,"I really had no inspiration.  I just wanted something that was going to be fun, maybe to ""hook kids"" into the possibilities when using scratch.  Flashy colors, cool music are ways to get kids excited about something new. I got stuck trying to sequence random costumes I'm proud of how I was able to make the sequence entertaining I want to do a project on playing or listening to music notes."
10269,"Creative Computing 2011 - Your ""Dance Party"" project creation experience",7/28/11 14:00,"My inspiration for the dance project was gardening.  This idea came from the trading cards from the first evening and was provoked by browsing the background images in Scratch.  I was surprised that there were no flower images, so I had to find one online (I didn't spend much time on this task).  I was interested in learning how to make Scratch communicate between objects (broadcast and receive)."
10269,"Creative Computing 2011 - Your ""Dance Party"" project creation experience",7/28/11 13:57,Dance Party was fun and it was great to have the group to help with issues that they were struggling with and for others to give me ideas.
10269,"Creative Computing 2011 - Your ""Dance Party"" project creation experience",7/28/11 14:19,"My requirements: I wanted my sprites to do different kinds of dance moves. What I did: To do this, I chose different sprites and used the different costumes for each sprite. I got stuck on using the thinking bubbles and orienting the bubble to show up where I want it to. Next, I will make my sprites move as they do the dance moves."
10269,"Creative Computing 2011 - Your ""Dance Party"" project creation experience",7/28/11 15:57,The last project that i worked on was the dance party project. I love the idea that it takes two people to dance. I remember the block parties that we had as i was growing up. This project reminded me of thoes days.
10269,"Creative Computing 2011 - Your ""Dance Party"" project creation experience",7/28/11 16:38,"The about me project What was your inspiration for this project? Me, I am amazing. jk. How did you do that? (about a particular aspect of the project) The loudness variable reads your scream/noise and broadcasts a variable when the loudness condition has been met. What did you get stuck on? Having the broadcast variable for each shoe hide/show the appropriate images given the coordinate of the mouse click. I did not know Scratch could read which Sprite was clicked. What are you most proud of? That it is a bit interactive and makes you scream. Also, that almost every image is from my library of pictures and makes it unique."
10269,"Creative Computing 2011 - Your ""Dance Party"" project creation experience",7/29/11 7:12,"That is a big issue. I will be introducing Scratch to content teachers in the fall and I know they will have the same concerns. But, you wrote that you were bothered until you figured out how to customize your sprite and the students will be too if they don't get time to learn that as well. One suggestion, since they can download Scratch to their home computer you can leave the customizing to home time and work on the subject content in school."
10269,"Creative Computing 2011 - Your ""Dance Party"" project creation experience",7/29/11 7:19,"I think using a variable countdown for this project is great. You could make it interactive by asking the program user how long should each sprite dance and then assigning the answer to your variable. Play with variable sliders too,"
10269,"Creative Computing 2011 - Your ""Dance Party"" project creation experience",7/29/11 7:20,Great idea. It could definitely work.
10269,"Creative Computing 2011 - Your ""Dance Party"" project creation experience",7/29/11 14:43,I wanted to design a game program that was challenging and interesting to create. I had trouble with some sequencing ( having things happen at the right time) and also I used the Green flag as a way to play the game again which was not a good idea because I couldn't figure out if the program was running for the first time (need to initialize the high score) or if it was just another attempt (keep the high score). I ended up using the space bar to signal another attempt. I want to add the ability to have multiple players and add difficulty levels.
10269,"Creative Computing 2011 - Your ""Dance Party"" project creation experience",7/30/11 8:48,I was a new user of scratch and had to get my head around designing a project. I went with the notion of making two stick people and building on the two original figures by copying and pasting them to form a party. I then began to add faces with different colors. I found the process to be confusing at first but with help from my fellow teachers I finished the project.
10269,"Creative Computing 2011 - Your ""Dance Party"" project creation experience",7/30/11 9:01,"I was making a scratch to introduce my self to the group. It seemed a bit boring having a sprite narrate the story so, dancing seemed a perfect fit. I got a few laughs and it made it more memorable. It was lots of fun making it with a dancing element."

Where: Harvard Graduate School of Education, Cambridge, Massachusetts? Who: You + fellow educators + members of the CCOW Facilitation and ScratchEd Teams at Harvard ? Cost: $15, which includes parking, breakfast, and lunch ? How: Made possible through funding from Expanding Computing Education Pathways Alliance (ECEP), a National Science Foundation Broadening Participation in Computing Alliance Using computing creatively -- whether for personal expression or for problem solving -- is something that everybody should be able to do. We hope that you will be able to join us for the Creative Computing Symposium on Saturday, July 13 at the Harvard Graduate School of Education. The day-long Symposium is an opportunity to connect with other educators and support each others' learning about creative computing with Scratch. The Symposium also serves as a capstone event for the Creative Computing Online Workshop (CCOW), which began on June 3 and ends on July 12. More than 1,900 educators from around the world are participating in the workshop, which involves hands-on Scratch activities, interactions with other educators, and reflections on practice. Participation in the Online Workshop is not required to attend the Symposium, but Symposium attendees will benefit from having some basic familiarity with Scratch (for example, by completing the Week 1 activities of CCOW). The Symposium is something between a conference and a party -- in the spirit of participatory professional development activities like EdCamp and ScratchEd meetups, the Symposium is an opportunity to connect with colleagues and to deepen your learning. The day begins and ends with formal remarks, but the bulk of the day is segmented into several self-organized breakout sessions. At the beginning of the day, we'll decide on the topics that we would like to explore and then break into groups to pursue the learning that we're most excited about. Want to spend more time hands-on with Scratch? Propose or join a group of builders. Want to make plans and get feedback on a Scratch Club? Find like-minded colleagues for a discussion. This day is about you and your learning. More information and registration is available at http://cc-symposium.eventbrite.com."

45933,Creative Curriculum Notebook / New Teachers,11/18/16 0:03,"Hi Kelly! I have experience doing these challenges with both non-CS teachers, so equivalent to your new CS teachers, as well as students. In both situations, they were able to pick which challenges they wanted to tackle, moving freely among them in any order. I taught an online course for teachers in my district about Creative Computing/Computational Thinking and none of the participants were straight-up CS teachers. We tried out the Debug It Challenges. I found some responses from their own experiences about how they worked through the challenges. Hopefully these might be helpful with your teachers. Learning from Peers/Collaboration ""At first I tried out adding some different buttons, a new green flag, a repeat, etc. I then looked at other students revisions and saw what they did, which inspired me to instead use a new motion button, and I liked that the best!"" Step Away ""I found that if I took a break, I was much more inclined to solve the problem quickly. I chose to debug a couple of challenges in Unit 4. I tried a few in the first two units but found the answers obvious and moved up a few levels."" Persistence ""I kept playing, tried different approaches and whallah!  I finally got it to work.  There is such a sense of gratification when you fix something!"" Experimentation ""When I first read that we had to debug projects I thought I wouldn't be able to do it! It turned out much easier than I anticipated and I felt successful. I thought the difficulty of the projects would increase a lot, but it seemed to stay a bit basic. I definitely appreciated that because I learned even more about the blocks, such as how to make a sprite flip. I also noticed myself thinking of the computational practices as I went through the exercises. How did I debug the projects? Mostly through experimentation. When I was done though, I did look at other projects (reuse and remix). For the last debugging activity, i did get the cat to saw meow with the speech bubble, but it was slow. I noticed another classmate used different blocks to get the cat to talk faster. We both completed the activity, but in a different way. Then I wondered, is one way the RIGHT way or does it matter if we both completed the project? I'm not sure it matters, but I think that we can learn a lot from each other."" Talking It Out (and I would add in acting out the task) ""When debugging, in all areas of life, I talk to myself.  A LOT.  With the debugging activities, I would read the instructions (sometimes incorrectly, as I discovered!), and then repeat the problem out loud in my own terms, and then go back and re-read one more time.  From there, I would go to the activity, open the script to examine it, and run it to see if what actually happened would align with what I thought was wrong.  Next, I’d take a deeper look at the buggy script, and start experimenting with changing the blocks, testing after each change was made.  It was similar to helping someone edit their video projects-- if there’s a gap in their media, or their image fades too quickly, or their audio is out of sync: you have to debug.  You have to keep trying things bit by bit, and then run it with each small change. And another vote for stepping away But sometimes, you have to step away and come back to it.  You can get so deeply hung up on fixing one part that you lose sight of the entire project, and that’s when it’s time to take a break.  I mentioned this to Ingrid-- that definition of insanity: “Insanity is when you keep doing the same thing and expecting different results..."" When you take some time to step back, look at the larger puzzle and all the other pieces in front of you, you can easily find the right fit.  This happened for me in a few of the debugging activities here… I took a break, went outside and shoveled snow, and came back in and suddenly the answer was right in front of me!""

45226,Creative ways to teach math using Scratch,10/20/16 2:50,"Hi! I'm currently collaborating with Universidad de Valladolid, Spain. We have two projects that use maths and Scratch: We developed ""MATCH: Programando Matemáticas con Scratch"" (MATCH: coding maths with Scratch), a research project in which we developed four guides to encourage different mathematical concepts on children 9-10 years (5th Primary here in Spain; USA's Grade 4). Concepts like angles, times, basic aritmetic operations, polygons, others). We have already tested those guides in different classrooms. We also have two extracurricular workshops, running in the cities of Valladolid and Segovia, called CJP (Club de Jóvenes Programadores; Young Programmers Club), in which weekly (2 or 3 hours each week) over 50 children (ages 7-15) develop their own projects in Scratch. They use A LOT mathematics on them (although I think they are not aware of it :D); some are published on a Studio we have on scratch.mit.edu. Two great examples are the Bottle Flip Challenge and an economy game they are developing right now. I hope this can help :) Thanks! Pablo"

45226,Creative ways to teach math using Scratch,10/20/16 6:08,"Hi all, I'm secondary school math teacher in Spain. For this school year, the Grade 8 students are working with Scratch in order to apply their knowledge in a practical way. They know how to use Scratch because last year they was working several introduction activities wich are designed in order to apply the Polya's problem solving technique. For this year, for example: If they are working with integer numbers and fractions, they make a construction in order to explain how to read a mix operation in english. If they are solving prblems about percentages they are going to make a consturction for calculating a discount of a product (like an online shop). If they are solving problems about the pythagoras theoreme they are going to make a construction to apply the theoreme. They main idea is make one or two constructions every unit for working to develop the curriculum with Scratch and computational thinking. I'm testing the scratch teacher acount for working this project. I'm also working with the University of Córdoba in order to research how Scratch and computational thinking improve the learning process comparing students who work with and not. I hope I can help you. If anyone need more information or obe informed about how the project is developing, just mail me :) Best regards, Álvaro Molina"

15437,Critical thinking,12/11/12 21:35,"William Whitlock Professor Kimball and class, This a post for Unit 8 and is a copy of a relative research article from the internet How Are Metacognitive Strategies Transferred? The application of metacognitive strategies in contexts other than those in which they were learned is the primary goal of teaching thinking. Transfer is the educational term for this reuse of strategies. Research supports a positive correlation between instruction in metacognitive strategies and transfer. A distinction is usually made between near transfer and far transfer, the former being when learning is applied in circumstances similar to initial learning, and the latter occurring when connections are made to dissimilar contexts. In If Minds Matter Perkins and Salomon (1992) talk about the fuzziness of near-far transfer and the difficulty in measuring the extent of transfer. In reporting on research in metacognition in ""Metacognition Research andTheory: Analysis and Implications for Instructional Design"" Osman and Hannafin (1993) manage to defuzz the issue of transfer by classifying metacognitive training strategies into four types, each of which promote transfer somewhat differently. These additional benchmarks allow educational practictioners to gauge transfer more accurately and design instruction which exploits the transfer potential of different metacognitive strategies. It is this classification scheme that has repeatedly drawn me back to this particular article, an article that at once clarifies both metacognition and transfer, and has practical application to instructional design. It is this perspective that serves as a backdrop for the remainder of this report, a report which presents my interpretation of this article. As criteria for their classification of metacognitive training strategies Osman and Hannafin (1992) used ""training approach"" and ""relationship to lesson content"". They describe metacognitive training strategies that may be embedded, or integrated within a criterion lesson and strategies which may be taught separately - detached - from academic subjects. With respect to the role of lesson content strategies may be dependent on, or independent of, content.Content-dependentstrategies focus explicitly on concepts that promote learning of particular content. Conversely, content-independent strategies are content-free, general strategies not specific to particular academic subjects. The four resultant strategies are described below. Embedded Content-Dependent Strategies Embedded content-dependent strategies emphasize near transfer. They are useful in understanding unfamiliar lesson material. They are specific strategies that support particular content and as such require explicit manipulation of lesson content and structure. Embedded Content-Independent Strategies Embedded content-independent strategies are general strategies that support particular content but are transferable to content of other lessons. Specific content is used to learn strategies but once learned executive control shifts from the lesson to the student. Detached Content-Dependent Strategies Detached content-dependent strategies are general strategies taught separately from content but meant to be applied within particular content. The intention is to improve facility with strategies before using them in context. They hold more potential for transfer than embedded content-dependent strategies. Detached Content-Independent Strategies Detached content-independent strategies are taught separately from content and are generic in nature. As such they support a variety of learning tasks and academic subjects. They help students to manipulate lesson material as well as to develop and maintain learning strategies. These strategies often focus more on procedural than conditional knowledge but the goal is strategy generalization and promotion of independent learning. They provide the greatest potential for transfer, that of far transfer. What is Metacognition? How are Metacognitive Strategies Transferred? Elements of Metacognition: What is Transferred?

40418,CS50 AP Workshops and Scholarships,2/18/16 12:36,"This is a message from David J. Malan, Professor of the Practice of Computer Science in the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences at Harvard. Along with others in the community, CS50 at Harvard is preparing a suite of resources for teachers who would like to teach AP CS Principles this coming school year. CS50 itself is Harvard’s (and Yale's) introduction to computer science for majors and non-majors alike that begins with Scratch and then transitions to C and then to web programming. (The course is also freely available via edX.) CS50 AP, meanwhile, will be a free adaptation for high schools that satisfies the new AP CS Principles curriculum framework. If you or a colleague might like to adopt or adapt CS50 in some form this fall or next, CS50 and our friends at Microsoft will be hosting a number of workshops this year designed to connect and equip educators for just that. (The workshops will offer CEUs and certification for PD.) A number of scholarships are also available for teachers who would like to take the course first through Harvard Extension School in preparation. If you’d like to learn more, see https://youtu.be/RVjHSAZdVJg for a quick introduction. And to apply for any of this year’s workshops (in whichever city is easiest among Boston, DC, London, and San Diego), see https://cs50.harvard.edu/ap/apply for all details.

Como me pareció un material valioso, comencé con la traducción al español. Traduje hasta la página 20 (un poco más de la cuarta parte del documento) aunque en la página 14 falta traducir lo de las competencias que me parece que la gente de Eduteka puede ser de ayuda. Me pareció importante traducir la primer parte, sobre todo para tener un lenguaje en común y poder utilizar los mismos términos a lo largo de de todo el documento. Quedan por traducir 16 de las 20 sesiones que componen el documento. Adjunto aquí el enlace para que lo descarguen en formato DOC para que otros puedan completarlo. Sería ideal que coloquen en este mismo foro, como respuesta a este mensaje, su deseo de colaborar y el compromiso, por ejemplo: ""Me comprometo a traducir las sesiones 5 y 6"". De este modo sabremos qué tenemos que traducir cada uno y qué nos falta. A medida que vamos teniendo listas las traducciones las vamos subiendo a este espacio. ¿Qué les parece? Espero sus respuestas.

We are here in animation class right now (after a week of no regular classes for NYState Regents week) and have added our dance parties to the gallery http://scratch.mit.edu/galleries/view/150355 Hopefully all projects have also been posted here: YouTube Channel: ScratchCardResources These links will also have a homemade Scratch Card that will teach something that the person learned from doing the project and can now share. The video on YouTube is meant to show what the Scratch Card accomplishes. I think we've now figured out a better way to handle the sound so that should be getting better in our next version of homemade Scratch Cards! Our class meets eastern time: Monday 1-1:46 Tuesday 10:06-10:52 Thursday 10:54-11:40 We're ready to meet and share with you! Anyone?
11405,Dance Party!,2/1/12 21:37,Hi Susan- We're in- do you have Skype? I sent you an email last week to see if we could set up a time. It looks like the Thursday time slot should work out well for our 7th grade group. We've been enjoying your students' projects. I'll email my SKYPE and email address to you to see if we can work something out for next week. -B.P.
11405,Dance Party!,2/1/12 22:38,"We're in! Anyone - everyone else? Sorry I was slow in responding - grades were due today :( Now back to Scratch! I can go on tomorrow just to check and see but if it's next week, that's fine too. Tomorrow, we'll look at the projects in the gallery together! We're just now moving onto the interactive band - They got interested in audio from the dance party and I promised some time to do some original audio editing. Then when we saw the interactive band sheet, it seemed to be a perfect match!"

I worked with an organization that was doing gaming for teens but even they only put together step by step instructions. This curriculum that you put together and the ed community has really enlivened my teaching and has brought out the best in my students!"

Next year, I will move this lesson earlier. I thought it would be a good review but they didn't have patience for it and because they were able to find the problem so quickly, some of the value of the debugging was lost. The one good thing that happened though, was that in two cases, people found solutions that were much more complicated than necessary and in both instances, the students were quick to show them that there was another fix that was much simpler."

13773,Debugging Strategies and Spiral Debug-It Challenge,8/13/12 17:31,"Here are some of the debugging strategies shared by participants during the Debug-It activity at the Creative Computing 2012 workshop. build the debug it challenge in Scratch and try it out break the program into smaller, manageable pieces modularize the program (ie: create a separate ""when green flag clicked"" script for different actions within a sprite) pull the blocks apart to see what each one does turn on ""single-stepping"" (found under the ""Edit"" menu) test the program out first to identify the problem read the scripts out loud (ie: to differentiate block functionality such as ""play sound"" and ""play sound until done"") check if there is a white highlight around the script to indicate it is running create markers along the program using a ""say"" block or by inserting a sound to signal that a certain part of the program has been reached At the end of the activity, participants were challenged to create a debug challenge of their own. One group volunteered their debug it challenge entitled ""Spiral"" for the rest of the participants to solve as a group. The challenge was: The student wanted to create a program where a pencil is drawing a spiraling square, but the pencil is only drawing a square over and over. What's going wrong? Download the Spiral project at http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/axamo/2723226 Once the group debugged the Spiral challenge, they then brainstormed follow-up challenges: Can you make the pencil draw a spiraling circle instead of a square? How about a spiraling hexagon shape? Can you think of other patterns?"
15403,December 2012 Meetup: Scratch 2.0 Breakout Notes,12/9/12 8:46,"At the December 2012 ScratchEd meetup at MIT, several of us (Vicki, Rosemary, Derek, Tom, Barbara, me) worked together to: (1) brainstorm possible extension activities for the Scratch curriculum guide, (2) explore new features in Scratch 2.0, and (3) start working on one of the proposed extension activities. 1. Activity Brainstorm One of my students recently shared how she used playing non-digital games as a starting point for developing digital games. I thought that this might be an interesting starting-point for our breakout session. In our breakout, we brainstormed a list of non-digital games we enjoy playing, without worrying about how easy or hard it would be to implement these games in Scratch. Scrabble Boggle Battleship Dress up games Candyland Jenga Lingo/Bingo Apples to apples Where's Waldo? Monopoly Sudoku Word search Line games Sand drawing game Tetris Mousetrap Operation 2. Scratch 2.0 Features Following the games brainstorm, we explored Scratch 2.0, making a list of new features. After 7 or 8 minutes, we regrouped and shared some of the new features that we had noticed, which included make a block, clone, video motion, cloud variables/lists. 3. Project Development We returned to our list of games, looking for a game that would be (1) reasonably easy to implement, given the limited time we had, and (2) might have an interesting connection to one or more of the new features in Scratch 2.0. We converged on a body-part matching game -- you have a skeleton and a collection of internal organs (off to the side), and you place the internal organs in the correct position on the skeleton. After working on the project for about 40 minutes, we took a break to reflect and share our experiences. A few notes: The visuals are an important part of this project, and it took a while to find good visual assets. (A challenge further compounded by the very buggy paint editor!) There are multiple ways of implementing the ""matching"" check. For example, Derek used an ""invisible target"" approach and I used a coordinate-checking mechanism. (I liked Derek's approach more!) There are multiple ways of implementing the internal-organ dragging. For example, making the individual sprites draggable versus having the individual sprites follow the mouse pointer. Generally, I thought that this was going to be a super easy project, but it was more involved than I anticipated -- and could easily be done with Scratch 1.4, not really an exploration of new features in Scratch 2.0. An interesting learning experience overall! I'm sure I'm missing details -- I hope my fellow breakout group members will add their comments/reflections/reactions! K"

4196,Detecting copying?,5/22/10 22:40,"Hi Barbara, We do not have an automated mechanism that given a particular project it would search for projects that are similar. However, whenever someone uploads a project to the website, we do run a process that reads the header of the file to figure out if it is based on someone else's project. This is how the automatic credit-giving line in remixes works. This works for the most part but as you can imagine there are always ways to get around it. If you are trying to compare two projects that are already on the website, we have a barebones version of a project ""diff"" that gets two project id's and tries to figure out what are the differences. This is not ready for the public but here it is in case you're interested: http://stats.scratch.mit.edu/diff/remixcomparator.html Let me know if you have any questions/feedback. Best."

47417,Digital curriculum vs. creative computing,2/17/17 12:04,"Hi Nilanjan, Thanks for sharing this question. I'm not sure I understand the difference you describe. I wonder if it might come down to differences in conceptions of teaching... Tens of thousands of teachers teach with the Creative Computing guide, and their approaches are as diverse as their contexts. Some teachers excerpt parts of the guide and integrate lessons with other subjects. Some teachers use the entire guide and fit it in with their scope and sequence. Some teachers use the guide in an ""on demand"" way, offering a page or a unit when a student expresses interest in exploring a new idea. You can read more about how teachers are using the guide here. I hope that helps! Willa, on behalf of the ScratchEd Team"

1805,Do we have any research about SCRATCH showing the importance of SCRATCH for Junior High ?,8/15/12 1:40,"Hi Rich, My group has been doing extensive educational research on learning CS concepts through Scratch by junior high school students. We (my colleagues are Orni Meerbaum-Salant and Michal Armoni) have already published two preliminary reports in ACM CS education conferences and are currently preparing a final report to submit for publication. The paper ""Learning Computer Science Concepts with Scratch"" maps various exercises in Scratch into a new cognitive taxonomy that combines the well-known Bloom and SOLO taxonomies. It shows what students are capable of learning at this age. The paper ""Habits of Programming in Scratch"" has some bad news: students develop bad habits of program design. Our overall conclusions are that a good teacher is essential to optimize students' learning - big surprise :-)). We have some good new coming out: we traced the students who learned Scratch as they learned ""real"" programming languages in senior high school and found that experience with Scratch significantly facilitates learning. When the teacher starts to talk about loops in Java or C#, the kids say: ""Oh, we know all about loops""! You can download our articles from the ACM Digital Library.

47132,Do your students keep Creative Computing Design Journals?,1/31/17 5:39,"I do Scratch workshops in series of ten after school. In their journals (10 blank A4 sheets stapled together) they write and draw plans and stories and their reflections. In the last 10 minutes it is 5 minutes totally quiet and everyone works in the design journal. Then starts the tiding up. And the next lesson I always read a few journals. After a few lessons a student suggested that it was better if they could work with colors. Then they could better clarify some things and would make it look nicer. My experience is that analoge journals gives them good focus, generates a lot of attention for their actions, creativity and diversity, is more inviting to work in the design journal at other times. The frontal reading and scroll back increases the importance of reflection. At the closing exhibition after 10 lessons for parents and family  the design journals were amongst other items (videos,  projects, activities and photos) a real attention grabber and much cause for conversation. I made an impression of some jounal pages https://youtu.be/0zR325nrzxM"

2644,Does Scratch meet specific state mandated objectives?,2/14/10 14:49,"I am writing a university paper and am looking for some feedback... Is anyone struggling with the conflict between letting students create and explore on their own versus ensuring that you are covering specific state-mandated objectives. I like the idea of giving my students some freedom to express themselves and explore on their own, but each day we spend doing this I know I am falling farther and farther behind in terms of covering the objectives I am expected to cover. How are other people dealing with this issue? Thank you for your input"
2644,Does Scratch meet specific state mandated objectives?,2/14/10 17:44,"In a word, yes!  You nailed the challenge.  Figuring out how to do both has me looking for ways to integrate Scratch (and other creative projects) as a means to get at state objectives.  How can Scratch be a tool in for how we teach what we are required to teach? What is your context?  My math class just used Scratch to explore similarity as part of a textnbook chapter .  I thought about skipping the Scratch because we are behind the pacing guide, but scolded myself about covering distance vs. teaching so kids get it.   I did simplify the projct.  It added three days to the unit, and now they understand coordinates and scale factors a whole lot better.

2644,Does Scratch meet specific state mandated objectives?,2/15/10 14:18,"I have been able to create several projects that address specific state objectives; however, often times they seem contrived.

Instead of the ""real world"" conforming to our state objectives, perhaps the objectives need to be reevaluated to meet the needs of the real world."

2644,Does Scratch meet specific state mandated objectives?,2/27/10 0:20,Afek I have been using Scratch with 2nd grade for 3 years now.  We do a unit where the children animate a folk tale.  Over the course of the unit they have a lot of creative freedom but the assignment also keeps them focused on literacy objectives.  I think good inquiry projects always involves a balance.  They need to be focused enough so that the children know what to do and certain objectives are met.  They also need to be open enough so that children can express their creativity.

MIT already uses those for app-inventor. http://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/front.html 2. School-email-addresses are not limted to 13+ 3. In schoold that do no use google other email-addresses can be used to create google-account but that may raise the 13+issue. 4. After that google-groups or google+ circles can be used to manage groups and share folders.. 5. Reliable, widely used system. Mian advantage: for schools it can take away the burden of ID-management from the teacher and put it mainly with the school. After that teachers can just select groups and individuals. Creating a bespoke ID+grouping system will be expensive for MIT. There may be othr federated systems that can easily be used."

I am using the Creative Computing curriculum as well as some content from The Hour of Code website. This will be the first time that my school is adding Computer Science to the curriculum.

Here's what I found on the wiki: ""To add a curator to a studio you curate, you must be a manager of the studio. First, go to the ""Curators"" tab and press the button that says ""Invite Curators."" From there, click on a user from the bar at the bottom of the page that contains all the users you are following, or type the username in the box below the button. If they have already been invited or they are already a curator of the studio, then it will give you an error message. The user you have selected will get a notification asking them if they would like to curate that studio, in which they can choose whether they want to curate the studio or not.

Or is there another way to send some custom bytes via Bluetooth from an Scratch-Programm to my I-Racer? What I found so far: Snap!

9096,FEB 14did anything change today?,2/14/11 20:36,"Sorry you are having trouble! We have heard of this happening a few times in the past. It appears to be caused by network security measures that manage cookies independently of the individual computers themselves. If you can pass the information onto the people in charge of your network, we'd be happy to discuss this with them to try to help sort this out. Here's a synopsis of our understanding of the issue: The Scratch website, like many others, uses ""cookies"" to keep track of the user account that is logged in. A cookie is a small file placed on the user's computer. All that ours does is identify the account that has logged in. Sometimes problems arise when networks try to manage the cookies on their own, instead of allowing the site to place the cookie on the user's machine. If the network gets mixed up or isn't configured properly, it can start to assign the wrong cookie to the machine(s) on the network.  As a result, the people using that network will start to get logged in as the wrong user. The solution is to fix the configuration of the network, or allow sites like Scratch to write the cookie directly onto the user's machine (which is the way it works with most network configurations - still very secure, and an industry standard). Not sure why you had no trouble logging into google docs, but they may use a different system."

9743,Females and Computer Education,5/17/11 10:37,"I taught two sessions of Scratch to 6-8 graders this past week. Boith classes had about twenty students in them. Of all those students a grand total of one was a female. What has happened? When I was in computer science in the 80's, It seemed to that  the mix was about sixty/forty. Some of the most brilliant technology people I have worked with over the last twenty some odd years have been women. I know this is not a problem we will solve here but this problem is depriving the field of technology with a much needed perspective."
9743,Females and Computer Education,5/20/11 1:41,"Very few females choose CS classes voluntarely, and like you mentioned it was not always this way. People always say we need more ""female-oriented"" or ""female-friendly"" examples in our CS1 courses, but I hardly ever see concrete examples. I once read (and the reference escapes me right now) that giving a context in which CS can help solve/address/increase awareness of social and environmental causes may entice more females into the technology field. I think one of the examples given was http://www.darfurisdying.com/ , among others."
9743,Females and Computer Education,5/20/11 7:02,"I think that at age of 12 years students already have build their opinion about CS. Girls think that CS is for boys, any boys thinks that it is for geeks. Teachers have to find better ways to motivate girls for CS. One good aproach is story-oriented teaching described by Caitlin Kelleher, creator of StoryTelling Alice. You can read some of her papers on http://www.alice.org/kelleher/storytelling/index.html . You can find also many other sources that describes problem of women in IT: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women,_girls_and_information_technology http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_computing"
9743,Females and Computer Education,5/20/11 11:29,"Based on personal observation, I think that 7 years old :-) is more of the transition point where you can either introduce technology as a creative and interesting endeavor, or something you go to a big box retail store and purchase/window-shop every Sunday.  Create or Buy?  Brain or Bucks? As more cool/uncool marketing is pushed down to younger and younger girls to sell dolls, clothers and accessories, etc. (I mean, where was the store ""Justice"" 15 years ago?) the new ""normal"" is to be less curious and succumb to peer pressure (or whatever is on TV/Cable/Internet).  I will not be surprised if a new study comes out showing the proportion of 6-9 yo girls playing with Legos dropped from 15-20 years ago versus today. As everyone on this board attests, Scratch is wonderful because it can capture the imaginations of the younger set and is gender neutral -- you can work on whatever you can imagine! Another positive development I see is the relatively recent offering of Leg Wedo kits www.media.mit.edu/sponsorship/getting-value/collaborations/wedo which unlike the Lego Mindstorms product line, comes in very bright colors and is appealing to the younger set regardless of gender.    Nice that it was developed by the MIT crew, and works with Scratch!  :-) The kids will take to these if the adults let them, offer it to them, make it available. *** Link to AAUW advocay group paper ""Why So Few?

13905,Final Reflections from Creative Computing 2012,8/21/12 16:03,"These are reflections share by participants during the final discussion at Creative Computing 2012. Now, I think of creative computing as... Creative computing is where design-based learning meets computational thinking and they DANCE! Creative computing has evolved into a new way of looking at the world and using technology to express yourself AND solve problems. I originally thought Scratch was a tool for teaching computing. I now think it is a way to teach almost anything. My thoughts on creative computing have really changed. This is the first time I've been shown a path to a philosophy as second nature and extremely relevant simple or complex, multi-dimensional, inspiring, engaging, allows ""winning"", doable Scratch is very powerful and can engage ALL age levels, very good learning experience My idea of computational computing includes many more concepts and ingredients The workshop created a very safe, collaborative environment where I became more creative Far more complex. Scratch shows few limits and can be used to create so many examples and things. Creative computing involves synthesizing various media to communicate ideas. less intimidated I never realized that serious computing skills could be introduced in such a fun, creative way. Scratch is a great tool to hook young students, especially female, into further studies in computer science. using computers intelligently in a manner that is healthy and rewarding My perspective has been widened. I knew that before but no one else does at my school, so I need to expand their view. works in progress that are shared, repeat forever: imagine, create, play, share, reflect I designed, created, personalized, collaborated, and reflected (a lot!). freedom, collaboration, problem solving involving everyone, not just us computer instructors awesome! inclusive! exciting! I think about creative computing in the same way I think about making art or other projects. I am very process-oriented but I can be frustrated. Working in ""small chunks"" can help me keep things simple. It's for everyone regardless of ability, age, etc! organizational thinking personalization The Media Lab was an eye opener! Wow wow wow (jealous) learning different approaches accessible, concrete, fun, challenging, creative expression, collaborative, experiment When I return to my students, I plan to... I've already made plans to present to my local ed tech group. I've also contacted my super about presenting, and I'm still here use different exercises use Scratch in the computer science classroom and Scratch in a meditation I will give and Scratch in the math department foster more creativity: offer more choice with projects find more ways to integrate computers and Scratch into existing curriculum Scratch has a much wider use than I first thought so I need to get other teachers involved and excited get them creating and producing with Scratch use Scratch with my students, along with the other ""stuff"" in the class revise lessons, chunk learning, break parts into manageable activities introduce the students to the connection between Scratch and robotics Design-based learning is a great new approach for my room. Reflect is so important! create a project notebook I am excited to take Scratch back to my school and use with my middle school students. The resources will help guide me. use the Scratch cards as ""mini-lessons"" within the sixth grade choice-based program I look forward to seeing how my kinds' input will change the way I approach things. I will load Scratch and start using it in my fourth grade class. I plan to incorporate the creative design model into my classroom. I'm bringing back new teaching methods for my work with teachers as well as with students. I plan to use Scratch in the beginning of the CS classes to aid in describing OOP. Scratch Scratch Scratch! need to get as many students as are interested to start on Scratch and share EVERYTHING!! I will give my students more ""play"" time. I'm excited about how this can be used in art. I can't wait to take this back. increase flexibility and freedom introduce game design into curriculum attend Scratch Day, interact with educators on ScratchEd, show teachers and students that they can create games that accommodate learners' needs create bulletin boards for students to post: goals, reflections, challenges/questions (like we did in the Media Lab)"

37620,"First ScratchEd Twitter Chat - Wednesday, October 28",10/22/15 17:04,"We're so excited to host our first ScratchEd Twitter chat on Wednesday, October 28 from 7:00-8:00 PM EST. Our topic is How to Host a Meetup. To join, use the #ScratchEdChat hashtag or follow the @scratchedteam account, who will be moderating the chat. Totally new to Twitter chats? Learn more below... What is a Twitter chat? Twitter chats are conversations that take place through tweets that are connected through a shared hashtag. Our hashtag will be #ScratchEdChat and our first chat is Wednesday, October 28 at 7pm (Boston time). How can I join? You will need a Twitter account to participate in the chat. To sign up, visit twitter.com. There are several ways to view a chat as it is happening: Go to Twitter.com and type in the hashtag you want to follow (e.g. #ScratchEdChat) in the search bar. You will see a list of every tweet that uses the hashtag, with the most recent tweets at the top. Third-party tools (outside of Twitter) are also available. Tweetdeck (Tweetdeck.com) and Tweetchat (Tweetchat.com) are two options. What should I expect from the Twitter chat? The Twitter chat will start at 7pm (Boston time). The @scratchedteam moderator will start the chat by welcoming participants, inviting people to introduce themselves. The chat will proceed with a series of questions from @scratchedteam. Chat participants are encouraged to share their thoughts on questions and to pose their own questions to the group. To add to the conversation, be sure to include the chat hashtag #ScratchEdChat to your tweet. The chat will be 60 minutes, ending at 8pm (Boston time). What else would be helpful to know about Twitter? Here are a few Twitter tips, (adapted from Twitter’s Insider Tips) # - A hashtag is any word or phrase with the # symbol immediately in front of it.The symbol turns the word into a link that makes it easier to find and follow a conversation about that topic. .@ - Tweets that have a period (.) before the @reply are meant to be seen by all of a user’s followers--not just those who follow both the sender and the receiver. RT - Like an e-mail forward, retweets pass along another user’s tweet to all of your followers. This can be indicated with a “RT” when you manually retweet (copy and paste the content from a tweet into your own tweet) instead of using the retweet button. This is a way people spread news on Twitter and add their own commentary to the shared tweet. MT - Similar to RT, an abbreviated for “Modified Tweet.” You can place a “MT” before the retweeted text to pass along your own message in addition to a modified or shortened version of the original. HT - A “hat tip” or “heard through” symbol (HT) is used to indicated that you’ve found out about something from another Twitter user--and you want to credit them on Twitter."
31138,Five Nights at Freddies,12/16/14 9:12,How is everyone handling the Five Nights at Freddy's Studio that students are so drawn to playing/interacting with?
31138,Five Nights at Freddies,7/3/15 8:34,I'd be very interested in hearing how anyone is dealing with this. Five Nights at Freddy's is rated 12 on the App Store and has been re-written in Scratch. It doesn't seem to break any of the Scratch terms and conditions but it isn't really suitable for primary/elementary children. It has been remixed almost 3000 times. I've had a query about the game from a local school and would love to know what other schools are doing. We should be teaching children how to deal with unsuitable material when they come across it online (and this is an opportunity to start those discussions) but is anyone doing any more than this?

10215,Flash and Scratch,7/25/11 11:32,I teach a high school animation class. It is a year long elective that meets 3 times a week for 46 minutes. I'm planning to weave Scratch and Flash throughout the year with iStop Motion rather than have a software based class. Is there anyone in the Scratch Educator community who also teaches Flash? I'd be happy to share what I put together and would love a collaborator or someone just to share ideas!
10215,Flash and Scratch,10/12/11 18:45,"I am curious as to why you are using Flash and Scratch for animation only. (Please excuse me if I am confused.) For animation, I would use Blender. It is an excellent animation studio which is reasonably easy to learn. Currently, I am teaching beginning programming using Scratch to elementary students. I plan to introduce some animation using scratch, but plan to go further into programming; gaming, applications, etc. Scratch is a grreat tool for introducing the basics of programming. Flash is a great tool for animation, but its true strength is in programming. Flash requires a higher degree of computer programming understanding. My background: Computer science, 10 years experience. I program in many different languages; VB, Java, JS, C#, C++, Perl, PHP, and others (If I haven't used the language before, give me a short time and I will). I have taught Robotics, Web design and applications, Flash design and programming, and Computer programming. I also tutor in math, science, ELA, throughout the educational levels. (Elementary - College) I will gladly offer my insights and opinions; answer any questions to the best of my ability, and help in any way possible.  (The expression, ""Pay it forward."" comes to mind. I would not be where I am today without the guidance of others.)"

22574,Following users in Scratch 2.0,10/24/13 9:30,"I have been finding that very frustrating.  I have the students share their projects and put them in a studio.  I then will either search for their name, their project name, look in the studio. Unfortunately I don't always find them! I was doing this so that I could combine (re-mix) a completely new project with ALL of their sprites.  It was very frustrating. However, if you just want to look at their projects, I would suggest you have them add them to a studio (which you could set to ""open to all"") Recently I had my project open on two different machines, and it saved the project to the older version, so I had to redo the WHOLE thing.  I love Scratch 2.0, but it can be a bit frustrating at times."

I am looking for a class of students that will collaborate with my class.   We are in Calgary, Canada and would like to do a cultural project with a class of any grade 1 to 12.   We are looking for a class that is in a different country than ours, or that are in eastern Canada (as this is a valuable difference as well). I have collaborated with classrooms around the world before and found it to be an amazing experience for all involved.  This project will be simple.  The project for my grade 5 students will have this is our  guiding question  'What makes us Canadian?""  and the international class would do the same for thier country.  Students in the class would create Scratch projects about significant historical events, people that have had an impact on their country, key ideas...  whtever is in your curriculum. If you are in grade 4 to 12, each student could make a project.  Younger grades may make a project together as a class. A really exciting part is that we would share a Scratch Studio.  The students would communicate to each other through their projects and through comments.   Knowing that there is a groups of studetns from another part of the world that they are working with is tremendously exciting for the students.  They love to show off their own countries.  They also love to make Scratch projects! If you understand what I am trying to put together,  please comment - send a message -  on my Scratch account:   'lgmeloche' . Hope to work with you soon!!!!

The following are the rubrics we plan to use.  As experienced teachers/users of Scratch, do you see any potential problems with these rubrics? A. Theme (Does the game match the theme?) 5: The game matches the theme. 3: The game partly matches the theme. 1: The game does not align with the theme. B. Story (Does the story cohere with the game?) 5: The story and game complement each other. 3: The story and game do not complement each other. 1: There is no story. C. Aesthetics (Do the setting, colors, and lighting cohere with the game?) 5: The aesthetics are used to complement the feel of the game. 3: The aesthetics and game do not complement each other 1: The aesthetics take away from the game. D. Mechanics (How well are events sequenced?) 5: Game play is smooth and events trigger with little or no trouble. 3: Game play is mostly smooth; some events trigger with poor response time. 1: Game play isn’t smooth and events trigger with poor response time. E. Player Instruction (How well does the game direct the player?) 5: The goal and rules of the game are easy to learn. 3: The goal and rules of the game are mostly easy to learn. 1: The goal and rules of the game are not easy to learn. F. Overall Experience (Is this a fun game?) 5: I would like to play this game again. 3: After some changes, I would play this game again. 1: I would not like to play this game again."

45385,games about social issues,10/24/16 12:54,"Hi Susan, One that comes to mind is this project, wherein students in Spain and India learned about the Refugee crisis and created Scratch sprites and backdrops for others to remix as they, too, learn about the crisis. We'd love to learn more about games for social issues, so we'll gladly tweet about this and ask the community to add links to a doc, which we can then make into a resource on ScratchEd. In the meantime, can you share a little more about what you're looking for? Any specific social issues, for example? Also, though not an example game, this piece, by Ricarose references many civically-engaged projects and the ways in which young people make meaning and explore big ideas and problems through Scratch.

57909,Global Collaboration Project- How to!,9/13/18 13:55,"Hi All! I posted in the Teaching with Scratch Facebook group that I was interested in collaborating with educators from around the world to help teach my students how to work collaboratively on a Scratch project while gaining a better understanding of global digital learning. I am excited that two different people have reached out so far beyond the post and we are working together to create projects for our students! My questions are as follow: 1. Using teacher accounts, how can I invite students from another class to follow my students' studio? Do they simply follow my students by having the list of the usernames? I'm looking for the simplest logistical plan as this will take place for hopefully 2nd-5th-grade students. 2.  Since projects are not yet collaborative in the live format, am I correct that one student must initiate the project and then the other would remix and edit that project? And then continue this procedure? Any tips/experience welcome or if anyone would like to participate, email me: alexis.cobo@pinecrest.edu Thank you!"
57909,Global Collaboration Project- How to!,9/18/18 11:40,"Hi Alexis! Here is what the folks on the Scratch Team have to say about these great questions— 1) You are able to invite anyone you would like to curate your class studios. This includes previously existing Scratch accounts and students in other classes. 2) Using the remix feature is a great way to have students collaborate on projects. You can also make use of the backpack tool, which would allow students to pull things created by one person (such as a sprite, script, sound, etc) to use within their own projects or collaborative projects. I hope this is helpful!! Best, Alexa"
16775,Good project for HS students?,3/2/13 23:03,"Hello, I am teaching Scratch in a HS Intro to Programming course and am hoping to spend a few weeks on it before moving forward. I have a couple questions: 1) How long would you give students to create a simple game? I want them to be comfortable with it so they can push the envelope but I also dont want to spend too much time on Scratch as I think it would be important to move on. Would 3 weeks be adequate? 2) What would be a good task to prove mastery of the programming concepts available in Scratch? Hangman will utilize several of the programming concepts such as loops, variables/lists, booleans, etc. Any other thoughts? Thanks for any input you may have Omar"
16775,Good project for HS students?,3/20/13 18:12,"Hi Omar, A Hangman game project sounds fun. You might be interested in checking out this Hangman game assigment and rubric posted by a fellow HS Scratch educator - http://scratched.media.mit.edu/resources/hangman-game-project-and-grading-rubric. I could also imagine other types of projects like stories, simulations, or interactive art, that might include some of the programming concepts you mentioned. If there are particular concepts that you have in mind, you could also pose the project assignment based on those items. For instance, what if you gave the students a list of the concepts/blocks/requirements you would like them to exercise in the Scratch project, but leave the genre and project theme open? Would love to hear more about what you decided to do! M"
16775,Good project for HS students?,3/24/13 16:16,"Omar, Scratch is great for introducing and reinforcing so many programming concepts. Here are some ideas from the ScratchEd community: 1. Design an interactive pencil that wears down and draws thicker lines as it writes (animation with costume changes) 2. Create a magic 8 ball that shakes and answers questions (lists, variables and random numbers) 3. Design a project using only an orange circle and purple square With each of these projects you will be amazed at the variations and how quickly students learn the concepts independently. If your time is limited, assign the sprite creations for homework or limit the number of sprites. Scratchers get easily drawn in to the sprite and background designs."
16775,Good project for HS students?,6/5/13 8:01,"I recently created a Hangman game and I found it surprisingly complex in Scratch and I required a few workarounds. There might be simpler approaches (I was using a different sprite for each letter, and so had to convert letters into costume numbers via a list) but I'm not sure it's ideal for beginners. I'll take a look at that resource Michelle has recommended to see how they did it! :-) Scratch takes care of collision detection which is hard in many other programming languages, so Scratch is well optimised for making arcade style games, and there's a lot of latitude in how sophisticated they can be, so students can tailor their game to their own level of expertise and curiosity. An arcade game might be the obvious thing to try. I ran a session for adults recently where I got them to write a game where balls bounce around randomly, and the cat has to dodge them. That had quite a small scope but still provided a reasonable challenge to them. It took them about an hour to do, using a guided worksheet that gave hints and tasks. Quite simple things can pose a challenge too. I got my group to work out how to draw a circle, after showing them the drawing tools and the repeat tool. That required the kind of creative thinking that programmers routinely do, and proved quite challenging as a warm-up."

5099,Google's App Inventor,7/19/10 17:48,Samsung had a a special version of Scratch that ran on Samsung and Nokia phones by making a jar file that could be installed directly on a phone. This is now gone and MIT are really missing a trick by not redeveloping this for Scratch 1.4 (which has variable size stage) - it is possible simply to run a scratch app on a mobile phone using java if someone does the right tweaks to get it to run. Can we have this soon please ??
5099,Google's App Inventor,7/25/10 16:09,"We agree that it would be good to have a version of Scratch running on mobile phones. John Maloney, the lead software developer for Scratch, has invested some time investigating the possibilities for Scratch on mobile devices, and he points to several challenges: * Performance. Many mobile devices don't have sufficient performance to run Scratch well. That was one of the problems with the Samsung version. * Screen size. It's not easy to squeeze the Scratch UI onto the small screen of a mobile device. Our feeling is that a totally different UI would be needed to author Scratch projects on a mobile device. (Of course, it is easier to create a Scratch player, with no authoring capabilities, for a small screen.) * Lack of standards. There is a lot of variability among mobile devices, so it would be difficult to make a version of Scratch that works on many different types of mobile devices. * Legal issues. A third-party software developer created a Scratch player for the iPhone and iPad, but Apple decided not to allow it, as part of its policy against apps that interpret or execute code. Here's our reaction to Apple's decision. * Our time. The MIT Scratch Team is a relatively small group, so we need to focus our efforts. Right now, we are focusing most of our development effort on creating a new version of Scratch that runs inside web browsers. We hope that this new version will support new types of Scratch projects (e.g., accessing online data) and new types of collaborations. As we work on this new version, we will keep looking for opportunities to bring Scratch to mobile devices. Mitch Resnick (for the MIT Scratch Team)"

And it´s all over in a short eyeblink... ;-) BUT If you draw a colored thick line in the Background (Stage) then you can change Gravity to positive 0.981(experiment with other values) when the Sprite touches the colored line. And it kind of bounces... --------------------------------------------- When Green Flag is Clicked [Go to X:0 Y:180] (Go to starting point) [Set Gravity to -0.981] (Set the value of the variable) [Forever (Loop) [Change Y by Gravity] (The Sprite moves down ) If Touching Color (If you have drawn a colored line) [Change Gravity by 0.981] (This increases the Gravity and the Sprite is moving up) Else [Change Gravity by -0.981] (This decreases the Gravity variable and the speed down doubles) End Forever] -------------------------------------------------- Probably are there many other and better ways to deal with gravity... and better...

12066,Hat blocks have mouths,3/8/12 12:13,"I would be happier if the Hat blocks in Scratch also had ""mouths"", like the conditional and loop blocks. That would better emphasize that the code below belongs to the block and would help a lot in my transition to Python from Scratch and BYOB."
12066,Hat blocks have mouths,3/9/12 3:33,This seems to me a clever proposal. Is there someone that can see any drawback?
12066,Hat blocks have mouths,3/9/12 6:19,"Wouldn't it just add visual bulk? The fact that the stack of blocks under a hat block are stuck together already suggest that they are grouped. Perhaps I'm not understanding the proposal, but my initial reaction is that it would be a redundant visual."
12066,Hat blocks have mouths,3/9/12 8:41,"I guess (but I'm ready to discuss it) that the same would be true of a ""forever"" loop: everything behind it will be part of the forever, as nothing can be added below. So there would be no strict necessity of having the mouth. To me Anne's idea would make the behaviour of the ""hats"" more clear, as in Scratch ""being attached below"" means ""this will be run before what follows"" (and this is something that is certainly true for hats) but ""being inside the mouth"" means ""this depends on what contains it"" that is -at least to me- ""more true"" of hats."

Moreover, these long scripts are difficult to develop and understand, so it is advisable to divide it.

Now, with the new name, you may discard the script [forever(if touching ""sprite3"")]. I guess you increased the size of this sprite in order to facilitate the running of ""sprite1"" but it would be easier to decrease the size of sprite1 or to use ""move 5 steps"" instead of ""move 10 steps"". There are 3 scripts that can be joined together: [When flag clicked(goto -210, 159)/reset timer/wait until touching ""sprite2""/say ""you won!""/wait 0.5 secs/say join secs to sprite2....].

Could you upload all the scratch projects into one ""Newletter"" studio in your online account when you are ready to publish? I wonder if a Google doc with links to projects could work in some way.

28323,Help! New to Scratch-Teacher Attempting to Teach Programming as Part of Main Curriculum in My Math Classes This Year,7/29/14 20:34,"Good afternoon, My name is Dillon Daniel-Hoffman and I'm so excited to begin something bold this fall. Starting in Septemer (late August really with inservice week) I will attempt to do something completely different in class. I have taught for three years now, all at this great public charter high school in Oregon called Oregon City Service Learning Academy. It is a school that sort of functions as the de-facto alternative high school for the district, and our approximately 180 students have largely been kicked around and given up on in their past academic and personal environments. They come often with high anxiety and with gaps in their academic and functional knowledge and skills. Because we are a public charter school, as the school's advanced math teacher, I am mandated to follow the state (and now Common Core) standards and attempt to teach my students the same Algebra, Geometry, Statistics and Probability, and Trig concepts that any other school would (we don't get up through Calculus, at least we haven't yet). I have a wonderful relationship with my students, many of which I will have for at least two full years while they are at our school, but helping them through the standardized mathematics curriculum is a nightmare. Every day is a battle to try to get past their apathy and disinterest, their anxiety and fear of the subject that has been generated by years of feeling inadequate and failing and/or having a traumatic experience with a teacher or with the material. I am often the third teacher they've had try to explain solving an equation or how to graph something on an x-y coordinate plane. My students are burned out with school in general, but especially with math. And yet, for the last three years, I have done what I was told to. I got them through as much material as I could. Most of them passed. They thanked me and then they were done. And the whole time, when I zoomed out, I felt horrible. Like I was living a lie. It's 2014! Why am I forced to teach students the pythagorean theorem and algebraic equations and not something applicable like game design or computer programming! Kids are developing apps at early ages and becoming millionaries, while my students are learning concepts they'll almost instantly forget and never use again! Especially because they are almost all not four year college bound. And the worst part? Since we got a SIG (School Improvement Grant) a few years ago, we replaced textbooks with laptops! We have a wonderful innovative site for math that I've used for two years now (corefocusonmath.com), but it's just a 21st century tool used to teach centuries old curriculum! These laptops should be used for something better...something, applicable... It was at a conference in May that I heard about Scratch. The dream became a plan. And that's where I'm at now. My principal is on board. Next year, I will attempt to do something different. I will alternate between the Common Core Standardized Mathematics that I'm forced to teach, and the computer programming skills that my students need (and will probably want) to learn. At least...that is the plan. Because here's the immensely scary part: I have never done this before. I took a couple of programming classes in college, but those were awful and burned me out with computer programming without giving me the knowledge and confidence necessary to do it, much less teach it. So, in the next month I'm diving in and trying to figure this out. I'm excited and scared and hopeful. Can I get 180 or so students signed up for this site? Will it work? What is the progression of stuff that I teach them when we're starting out? And how do I best go about this? Will this just fail miserably, or will it become a model that hopefully many schools like mine and in general could follow? So many questions, and any insight would be greatly appreciated. The journey begins now. Thank you so much for reading this and sharing anything that you might feel inclined to share."

49705,Hour of Code for K-1,5/5/17 14:28,"Hi everyone, Hope you're having a fantastic Friday! I'll be presenting my first Hour of Code at our library next week, and had a question - for the project, I've chosen the ""Make It Fly"" activity.   However, our program is open to ages 5 to 10.  I'm covered as far as grades 2-8 are concerned, but I'm not sure what to do about the K-1 crowd (if any show up).  Are there any Scratch projects that are suitable for ages 5-6?  I would use Scratch Jr., but we will be using laptops, not tablets. I thought about the 'Animate Your Name' activity as a possibility, even though it is for grades 2-8, because it looks so simple.  But I want to make sure to choose the right activity for each age group. Any suggestions? Thank you very much!"

This thread was started in October 2013 to imagine the possibilities for the ""Hour of Code""... What should someone's first hour of programming look like? What activities might you have them do? What projects might  show them? What might the essence of the experience include? Share your ideas in the thread below..."
22891,Hour of Code Ideas,10/5/13 11:21,"Questions from the group with Rosemary, Lorraine, Sandie -- How do we think about age range? What elementary school students can do in an hour will look different than what high school students might do. What do you give people ahead of time? What happens when you start with a blank screen vs. you start with something that you can remix. How do we help the learners end with a finished product? How do we show what's possible? Start with a video that includes snippets of what's possible, ""this is what Scratch is for"" and ""here's what can be done"" and ""make something amazing"" and ""your imagination is the only boundary"". What other resources might be possible? Scratch cards. (Tips window have no surprise.) Project ideas -- Something fishy: interactive aquarium Experimenting with the dot: adding interactivity to simple graphics Bring it to life: bring two prescribed objects to life Goals for the hour -- For the opening: snippets of range of possibility (movement, sound, interactivity) (Getting an account or not) Getting to building right away Varies for standalone vs. group: some sharing via studio or in class"

22891,Hour of Code Ideas,10/8/13 14:04,"Looks a great idea but is this just for US schools/students? I hope the material will be made available outside of the US. I think there would need to be number of activities depending on age range and ensure that part of the time is spent explaining what has been achieved at the end of the session. Would expect some very simple game for U10's (e.g. very simple maths e.g. what is 2+3?), a little more advanced for U13's and maybe something to control something e.g. turn on a motor or LED for older children. All achievable using Scratch (of course :-) ). Clearly the material to be used needs to be 'road-tested' and suitable for use on different equipments (not just PCs, MACs, but also machines such as RaspberryPI and tablets). There also need to be enough supporters to help as the poor teacher won't be able to cope on their won. When I have done 'hour coding sessions with 9/10 year olds, I find that the ratio of at least 1 supporter for 5 children is essential. This ratio can increase for older children but it does depend on the ability of the students."
22891,Hour of Code Ideas,10/10/13 0:04,"I'm still a big fan of Scratch Cards. . . I had great success with 9th/10th graders using the following strategies: Have previous/experienced Scratch student open with brief project presentation. Either student or instructor gives cursory intro to the Scratch interface. Group students in clusters of 4-5, one student per laptop. Students are given 2 minutes to create account, start new project and choose one sprite at random. Each group given 4-5 different Scratch cards. Announce they have 2 minutes to try out the block/technique on their card. After 2 minutes yell, ""Switch,"" and they all pass their card and add new block to their project. Do this 4 times then yell, ""Scratch."" Now instead of switching cards, students move to the next computer and modify that person's project. After 4 ""Scratches"" everbody returns to their seats to check out what has become of their original project. If time permits, do gallery walk and/or ask for volunteers to present their Scratched Scratch project. Ticket to go is adding their project to a Scratch Studio created for that specific class. Can broaden by having a grade- or school-wide studio. My goal in developing the above procedure was to immediately engage students, filter the possibly overwhelming block-based coding environment into just 1 block at a time and focus their energy on coding rather than spending 20 minutes browsing canned-clipart.  The shifting of seats not only keeps things lively, but also removes some of the attachment to project outcome, as well as physically demonstrating the idea of collaboration and remixing."
22891,Hour of Code Ideas,10/23/13 7:34,"I have middle schoolers in a semester long class.  Some are currently avid Scratchers.  I'm wondering how to use them as resources to teach the other students.  I like Derek's idea and maybe I could send them each out with a pack of cards and directions.  I'm thinking of asking science or math teachers for a class period and they could have laptops for all their kids or pairs of kids. I like Karen's idea of starting with a 'this is possible' video. Currently, I use this one in class: http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=jxDw-t3XWd0 It's from the Starting_from_Scratch_LEARNER.pdf curriculum I have my students do for a couple of weeks as an intro. Of course, there's the problem of kids who already program in the class with non-programmers, but they could be resources.  Maybe a combination of ideas--total newbies use the cards, slightly familiar with use the 10 block challenge, others create a simple game in scratch or remix something with specific goals in mind. We have a a 7-12 grade American-style school and my kids are 7-8 grades.  We have some HSers who have done Scratch, but most haven't.  I'd like everyone to have a chance at it before they leave school, so the Hour of Code is a great way to start.  I'm also wondering what tutorials will be available at the Hour of Code site: http://csedweek.org/resource_kit/tutorial"
22891,Hour of Code Ideas,10/31/13 9:33,"Howdy folks, I'm glad to have stumbled across this thread (and Derek, glad to know that you're a part of it). I'm heading up efforts to help learners 6-18 at a very large network of afterschool institutions (sorry, can't name names in a Google-able thread!) engage in the Hour of Code, and wanted to share my perspectives on the space. Basically, we're hoping that staff at participating organizations are able to run hourlong sessions using Scratch, Kahn Academy or Code Academy. I know for a fact that, at many organizations, one or more staff have some familiarity with Scratch. This makes it a great candidate. However, their familiarity is entirely variable and their confidence in self-generating hourlong implementation objectives isn't a given. In general, their anticipation is that we (meaning me, from the HQ) can provide more specific guidance about how best to utilize Scratch in that one hour session. So, I've been looking forward to the outcome of this thread. With that in mind, here are some of the opportunities and constraints that I've seen: I've found the 'Scratch Cards' most helpful & hadn't know of their existence until this thread. Because the afterschool space tends to be a bit chaotic, I'd avoid 'switching stations' too frequently, or at all. Computer station audio is not a given, but it does exist. So we have to plan on scenarios that don't rely on instructional video, although instructional video could enrich the session. We could presume that instructors can step in if audio/video isn't a possibility. I love the idea of generating anew, particularly with a very concrete goal in mind (animate two objects), but also see the value of remixing (a different sort of tinkering). If the later, it would be awesome to use that experience to help entry-level Scratchers get a sense of [loco]motion and perhaps, even variables. I'd love to use this as an opportunity to shift the instructor - learner paradigm a bit. When a learner or group is struggling with a logic question, why not turn that to the class to resolve? Our educators don't always feel this empowerment (often try to answer the question themselves). What would an hour of using Scratch look like with a 1:2+ computer:learner ratio? From my vantage, goals for the hour include: Growing staff and learner familiarity with Scratch Teaching some of the basics Engaging learners in problem-solving of modest, reasonable complexity Describing how an understanding of Scratch can lead toward 'real-world' code tinkering Indicating a 'what next' (which might be very much specific to this organization) Which means that a session could: Introduce Scratch through brief dialoge w or w/o video (5 mins) Introduce an intiial simple problem (move from Point A to Point B) (10 mins) Introduce additional logic (loop to draw a shape) (10 mins) Apply in the context of a remix to solve a problem (e.g., Activate C when A hits B) (30 mins, fuzzy) Recap / Talk through challenges / solutions / what next (5 mins) So... those are some perspectives on my approach to the day and Scratch space. Perhaps it'll be helpful food for thought as the materials evolve? Here's to hoping so! Cheers, --Dave"
22891,Hour of Code Ideas,10/31/13 16:38,"The problem I'm having with using the scratch during that week, is access.  Our computers at school have deep freeze so not allowed to download to pcs.  scratch 2.0 is web based but then you have the problem of creating accounts for everybody. My after school group I created 25 accounts with my email. But now that we are going to start a new group and end this one, do I recycle those accounts or create new ones. Back to the hour of code,I have created some projects for the kids to remix and play with but haven't figured out yet how to give them access. I did put Scratch 1.4 on our shared drive was going to see if the downloadable 2.0 would work from the shared drive.  But then there is a long process for students to open and use.  First have to go to shared open Scratch, then go back to share and open project. Any ideas, I plan on our school doing the Hour of Code, from kindergarten to 5th grade. Planning on using Scratch for grades 3-5."
22891,Hour of Code Ideas,11/1/13 13:07,"Students do not need an account to create a project in Scratch 2.0, however without an account they will not be able to save their project. If you want/need them to crate and save a new project you might get away with creating just 1 group account--then each student use their name for project name (first name & last initial for privacy).  The advantage of this method is seeing all of their projects when you are logged into that account."

22891,Hour of Code Ideas,11/13/13 6:36,"The tutorial is great! I plan on my entire school participating in the hour of code, so I have a few questions about the tutorial.  If a student and teacher has no experience with scratch and tries to follow the tutorial, they may become frustrated when trying to create the sprites that are in the tutorial.  I think maybe we should have a tutorial that uses backgrounds, sounds and sprites that are available in scratch.  From my experience the students will want to create the project as shown.  If these are to be where the student needs little teacher intervention or if its a teacher who has no experience, the tutorial needs to be simple and easy to follow with no extras such as using the paint interface, importing of images etc."
22891,Hour of Code Ideas,11/13/13 6:59,"Doris, I was thinking the same thing.  I was going to make that suggestion and then I thought I would just provide my students with a folder on their desktop of holiday/winter themed graphics.  For me that is no big deal and importing in Scratch is easy, however if for the inexperience teacher it might be an issue."

Usually I save on a shared drive for students, but most of my students ( hate to say it but teachers also) need help getting there. I think if they include some holiday themed items that would solve the problem.  Just found out today our music teacher is having a sub that week, so I need it simple lol"
22891,Hour of Code Ideas,11/13/13 18:19,"My school used to have Deep Freeze, too.  I got in the habit of creating a starter project which included a default set of sprites, then had each student remix it.  You can also include any instructions/goals/even a rubric as the starting screen, which they can then hide/delete.  This has the additional advantage of seeing all of their projects listed as remixes of your original project (now availabe in the fun ""Remix Tree"" view), an instant online project portfolio ready for assessment and/or showing off."

22891,Hour of Code Ideas,12/4/13 10:44,"Hi, love your idea of the holiday cards for the Hour of Code activity.  I was wondering if someone could quickly add some holiday-related sprites?  You picture a snowman, tree, and gift, but none of them are found in the library.  While, of course, it's possible for the kids to draw their own, for those of us who are not skilled artists, you're adding a layer of complication that could stop some kids in the first step of the tutorial.  They will either balk at having to draw, whine that there are none available, or spend so long drawing just the perfect sprites that they never get on to the coding part. Maybe someone is already hard at work doing this, if not, if someone could add some appropriate sprites and backgrounds, it would help. If needed, I can ask my daughter to whip some up and I'll email them to you to add."

Scratch speaks sends formatted queries to the extension app over a network socket (remote or localhost) and the app then communicates with the Arduino. Example: The Snap!Mobile - Start Your Physical Computing Engines! by MrYsLab (Instructables) www.instructables.com/id/The-SnapMobile-Start-Your-Physical-Computing-Engin/ Software extension (requires Python 2.x and a few modules): MrYsLab/s2a_fm: A Scratch Hardware Extension For Arduino github.com/MrYsLab/s2a_fm s2a_fm also requires the Arduino to be programmed with Firmata to process the commands and requests from the extension app. Caveats: 1) I have not tried this (decided that I don't need it for my course) 2) The Scratch team warns that the extension framework is subject to change.

The answers to the exercises will generally be one or more blocks of Scratch code. Ideally I would like something like the backpack, but in a more flexible format. Ideally I'd like to create a problem set ""document"", and students would read the problems in the document, solve the problems using Scratch, and then drag the code block(s) used in the solution (which would generally be blocks of script for a single sprite) *into* the document. Then the teacher could review the solutions, and also the kids could use their prior solutions by dragging code back out of the document when they are working on future exercises. My understanding is that the only way I could do something like this with the Scratch infrastructure as it stands is perhaps to have the students set up a studio and create a Scratch project in the studio for each exercise in the problem set. Or for very short exercises they could put the answers to several exercises in a single Scratch project. My fallback alternative is to create the problem set as a google doc, and as students complete the exercises they would take screen shots of the Scratch screen showing the code blocks, and paste these screen shots into the doc (which is shared with the teacher). That's pretty ugly, but it would work. I'm just wondering if others have come up with a better solution for this type of thing.

24711,"how can students ""submit"" answers to exercises",1/7/14 6:31,"I've got a high-tech and a low-tech solution for you.  On the high-tech side, you could create a thread on the Scratch discussion forums (perhaps in the Collaboration thread), where they can take advantage of the block plugin to type out their commands and have them rendered as Scratch blocks. The low-tech solution would be to give them a worksheet or index card on which they would hand-draw/write their block solution.  This may actually be more authentic to the professional programming world where paper-prototyping is a longheld practice.  You could even tie it in to Scratch Cards, so students may share their solutions with each other. However the easiest option I can imagine is having them take a screen capture (this blog entry shares how to capture just a portion of the screen on both Mac and PC so they could just show the blocks vs. full screen) and paste it into your assignment in Edmodo so you can scan them all quickly and even provide feedback or grade them within Edmodo.

Then I go on to guide them along on how to create their own game variations, and in the process teach them programming and computational thinking concepts.

That was very helpful to design or create the scripts ""next"" to each other and have them occur simaltaneously or soon after an event! So parallelism is when things are happening at the same time and events are things that are going to be happening."
348,How do you explain parallelism and events?,7/17/09 16:26,"Parallelism is when actions occur at the same time. When scripts in scratch are executed at the same time. You can run parallel actions in scratch by using the same ""hat command"" to begin each script. Events are actions that occur in a sequence, one after another. One event can lead to another event. In scratch to use events you can use one script that continues with multiple commands. You can also use the broadcast command to control the events."
348,How do you explain parallelism and events?,7/17/09 16:40,"Parallelism are events that can happen at the same time, either independently or inter-dependently.  In Scratch, each sprite can respond differently to a common event (broadcast).  They can also send messages (boadcasts) to each other to trigger new events. This can be used to control timing/coordination between sprites.  This is better than using delays (wait) which are static and are difficult to maintain when making changes to the project...."
348,How do you explain parallelism and events?,7/17/09 16:44,"Parallelism is things occuring at the same time. Your demonstration having one person being the programmer and then having other people being the sprites was very illustrative to me. I plan to use this with my students to show them how the scripts work. I love that you enlarged the commands and had them taped to the board. I was not aware that you could put scripts beside each to run parallel. The broadcast command is awesome. Your demonstration also clearly illustrated events - which can be defined as actions, something happening. When designing scratch projects this concept is key to building projects that perform in the manner that you want."
348,How do you explain parallelism and events?,7/17/09 16:52,"Events are happenings or scripts that are going to happen. Parallelisms are events that occur at the same time, independently or in conjunction. The modeling of these concepts this morning was great. I am such a visual learning and the large scale model help it all to make sense. Please post those blocks as a downloadable resource. I can see using these in groups within the classroom/lab setting. I want to be able to print them on cardstock to laminate and print them on magnetics to use on a whiteboard."
348,How do you explain parallelism and events?,7/17/09 17:01,"Parallelism is ""stuff"" happening at the same time.  Using Scratch in a computer science course for a cross curriculum based project is an example of parallelism in the classroom. Today's example of demonstrating parallelism in programming with Scratch was a great tool for my ""teacher tool box"".  THANK YOU!"
348,How do you explain parallelism and events?,7/17/09 22:14,"In today's lesson you explained parallelism to us as ""stuff happening at the same time"", and events as ""letting things know that something is going to happen"". I thought the lesson was brilliant--the human sprites and the taping of code to the white board slowed everything down and made important concepts really clear.  Stepping through and showing mistakes that one might make was also important. The timing of the lesson was also perfect for my needs--I had struggled with parallelism the evening before as I was working on some projects."
348,How do you explain parallelism and events?,7/17/09 22:40,"Parallelism is some ""thing"" happening at the same time.  Each coded script allows for this to occur using the applicable code fragments. These coded scripts can be grouped as stacks which allow the script's execution to be faster. The event is letting the ""thing"" know that something is going to happen. The broadcast code allows all sprites to hear the message. Then the command ""when I receive"" can be used to allow another happening. This is a very exciting approach to coding.  I can envision my computer science newbies beginning their year with Scratch.  This code sets the stage for the logical thinking process needed to tackle other programming languages."
348,How do you explain parallelism and events?,7/18/09 9:30,Parallelism is a concept that has rocked me to my programming core. Having coded in COBOL and event driven programming languages and being a very strong mono-tasker by nature I like controlling ONE THING at a time. My world is now filled with complication.
348,How do you explain parallelism and events?,7/18/09 9:31,"An event is an occurrence which can be used to trigger the start of a stack of blocks.  An event can be a generated by a Broadcast, but it can also be generated by user input such as pressing a key or clicking the mouse."

318,How do you introduce Scratch to beginners?,7/13/09 21:19,"Do you have any favorite activities or approaches to introduce Scratch to beginners? At the moment, I really like something from this set: 8 blocks: Create any project given a particular set of eight Scratch blocks. Monkey business: (with very little introduction to the Scratch user interface, just showing how to snap blocks together) Create a project where something surprising happens to a monkey. Interactive me: (with a walkthrough of how to create an interactive sprite) Create an interactive project that helps others learn about you and the people, issues, and things you care about. What do you do?"
318,How do you introduce Scratch to beginners?,7/13/09 22:31,"I'm still learning Scratch, but I took the risk of staying one lesson ahead of the kids this year and taught it in our computer lab.  I used the How to use Scratch Intro video from the videos page on the Scratch website as the very first exposure.  This gets the students curious and interested to get in and explore on their own.  I guide them through all the ""buttons"", give them some exploratory time, and then they start a simple walkthrough lesson.  This introduces the concepts of deleting and painting new sprites, switching costumes, and using the forever block.  It's very simple, and we don't get into naming sprites or importing them just yet.  The stage stays blank, too. From this point, some students are going to rocket off on their own and start self-directed learning, trying out new blocks and jazzing up this lesson.  For others, it at least makes it seem easy to do, and they are willing to do some more tutorials to get some projects done. I like doing a step-by-step tutorial like this at the beginning because it allows all students to have a feeling of success, and this gets their interest peaked.  Although, at our advanced users Scratch summer camp, the kids really breezed right through this and were eager to move on to something more challenging. The projects that are included in Scratch are great examples, too."
318,How do you introduce Scratch to beginners?,8/12/09 22:19,"My museum uses Scratch both in our museum for summer classes and workshops and in local libraries. Because we're sometimes working in drop-in settings where we might have a youth come in and spend time anywhere from 5  to 60 minutes,  We've started to introduce Scratch in a whole new way: We have computers set up with Scratch running, and invite youth to come and try the a 'new' program called Scratch. We have Scratch projected on a screen and withing a minute or two we'll show them how to do a couple things: click on the word 'file' in the menu, then go down to 'open' then show them the 'examples' button over on the leftr side of the window that pops up. Normally once we get this far they're off exploring - and ignoring us ( until they have a question). We'll show how to open the folders to the youth who're interested and then call out to everyone how if you click once on a project name in the folder list, you get a preview. Finally once they have the program open we try to get their attention ( we see them ignoring us as they mess about with Scratch as a very good thing) and show them that that green flag button will often get the program started. Sometimes the room suddenly becomes noisy with sound, and sometimes not - if not we'll prompt them that some of the projects make sound or music ( and sometimes this is where we need to help get sound working ( if available)) This usually ends up being 15-30 minutes. Whats been very suprising ( and a bit unerving even) is that we're finding we do not have to tour the youth through the program buttons and menus - and in fact when we've stuck to a tour of Scratch ( beyond file/open/green flag) they're often not listening and moving ahead on their own. We've been calling this our 'just in time' introduction. What can follow is dropping a scratch card next to computers, or simply getting everyones attention once they've begun, and showing them how to draw a sprite ( and thats the next discussion)"
318,How do you introduce Scratch to beginners?,8/22/09 13:30,"I've been teaching Scratch for about 2 or 3 years, whenever I first found out about it. I download the Scratch video and the kids love watching that, about how they can do these projects too just by ""messing around."" Then I introduce the blocks, noting color and what they each do. After that, I take out one of the cards from the Scratch site, an easy one like maybe the ghost gliding, and then they are hooked. But, I don't let them go free yet... no, I make them do enough until it's 5 min. till end of class. Then they play. Then next time, I finish the cards and give them little assignments. Before you know it, they have taken off in 10 directions. I find if they don't have enough knowledge before they are set free that they just pile the sprites onto one another. But, if they know how to make them move then it goes much better!"
318,How do you introduce Scratch to beginners?,10/29/09 13:30,"I typically work with kids from 6 yrs up to 10 yrs who have no Scratch/programing experience at all in small groups (6-12 at a time). We have been using Pico Blocks but I keep a laptop on the side of our classroom with various Scratch applications I've coded. The first thing I do is ask who has used a computer before and similar questions, the point being to take them from feeling unfamiliar with the whole thing straight to ""Oh, yeah I guess I have more experience than I thought."" Then I explain how a computer only does what you tell it to. I briefly imitate a robot and get them to ""program"" me by giving me audible commands. I set a goal of making me get across the room and pick up an object. I have a lot of fun with i and they do to. For example, they figure out to tell me ""Start walking"" pretty quickly but become highly amused when I walk straight ahead into the wall. This segues into a brief run down of some of the things you can do with the system. Then I give everyone their Lego sets and let them spend some time doing nothing but working with the pieces. Next, we pick our first project and off we go! With this age group and time constraints running from 5 days of 4 hour classes or even one day of 3 hours, I have to do a lot of pre-planning and maintain a flexible lesson plan. I am also teaching at a museum so 1)they are paying to be there 2) we want them to come back 3) they don't have to come back! So I make sure that they know about my basic rules from day one... If we're not having fun, we are doing something wrong. There are no wrong answers in my classroom because you can learn from anything. We share materials and help each other. That's pretty much it. I also do not stand for ""telling on each other."" In my small environment, I am aware of everything that goes on. Most of the time when a student complains about another student, they were sharing in the alleged ""trouble"" up until they decided to get the other one in trouble. My students readily accept this as I explain everything in a way that they can understand and relate to instead of as a ""way it is"" rule. I get their sympathy with this by asking them ""What happens we we have to stop having fun so I can handle problems?"" ""Do we want to lose the little time we have to play over silly stuff?"" Basically, I use empathy as often as I can. It is not about you, me, or them, it is about us. Of course no plan is perfect so even if I have to address a student one on one, I make sure that they feel as though we are 2 people talking instead of me coming across like the light-flickering school teacher demanding/begging for their attention. I am very fortunate to be working in such a wonderful setting. I am allowed to step outside the normal teaching boundaries imposed in the Public School System and I get excellent results. My students often do not want to take their break time. At the end of the day, I have to make them go home. They beg to know about more classes, where to purchase the supplies we use, and they show up for the next set of classes. It probably helps that I am a born performer so I have an intuitive knack for reading people and situations. I also pride myself on thinking outside the box. Our town is rather small and sometimes can feel bleak. We are extremely lucky just to have the facilities we use. So I repeatedly resort to my own proven methodology... immediately knock them sideways with something they aren't expecting, now you've got their attention and better yet their interest, now con them into thinking that this is all just a big fun playtime. Once they go into ""We're having fun mode"" I can cram an unbelievable amount of knowledge in at every opportunity cause know we're not learning, we're playing. I was a gifted student who was failed by the school system. I also come from a long line of educators. I see instructors time and time again who seem to act like they themselves were programmed (somewhat poorly) by someone using Scratch. And my heart goes out to all the teachers who have been constrained by administrators and do gooders who understand bottom lines far better than a random child standing in front of them. I do it because I love it and there is nothing more infectious than that. I guess i hindsight, maybe school didn't fail me after all. From conflict comes action!"

I think there has been a huge shift in the way that kids learn. Older generations were as a rule more prone to be wary of hitting the 'wrong' button. Newer generations already know concepts so instead of not hitting the buttons, they punch away. This is because they are familiar with and expecting/looking for concepts... Save, Delete, Enter, Reset, etc. Personally I suspect that this gives them somewhat of a leg up on various learning curves."

As it stands now, there are no plans to release additional versions of Scratch based on the Scratch 1.4 codebase. So it won't be possible for others to download and install a version of Scratch with updated help files until Scratch 2.0 is released - probably in late 2012. However - if you do translate the help files and send them to us, we'll make them available on our Languages resource page: http://info.scratch.mit.edu/Languages So it will be possible for people to download your translated help files and manually install them in Scratch 1.4 (replacing the English versions that are included by default). But this must be done manually, so it's not ideal for most end-users. The good news is that Scratch 2.0 will be all ""in the cloud"" - meaning it will run in the browser, and won't require Scratchers to download or install anything. This will make it much easier for us to update translations. As soon as we get a new translation, we can make it live in Scratch 2.0. Hope this helps.

I am now giving them homework assignments to code a specific program.

12388,How to introduce Scratch in 1.5 hours?,4/8/12 6:01,"Dear Scratchers, A group of software developers including me came together in Belgium and decided to organize small daily workshops to introduce programming to children. I, being a Scratch fanatic, was given the task of creating a very short, introductory lesson that is going to last about 1.5 hours, and use Scratch. I started to work on it but I also would like to hear from the experienced educators. The groups will probably consist of 9-10 children, ages between 10-13, and almost no exposure to programming beforehand. And we'll have 1.5 hours to introduce Scratch. (During the same day, they will visit other sessions / tracks such as robotics programming (with Dwengo robot), Lego Mindstorms, etc.) All tips (including pitfalls, things to avoid, etc) are welcome. Cheers, -- Emre Sevinç"

12388,How to introduce Scratch in 1.5 hours?,4/11/12 8:24,"Hello Emre We had a couple of introductory workshops this year and almost every time we had the same routine: First we show the software interface, the stage area, sprite and script area and the blocks. We show the children how to put together two blocks (we usually start with the ""move"" block and ask them what will happened if we will change the number from 10 to 100). We show them 2 simple projects, one game one story / animation, and give them an open task. ""Create a project with at least one sprite moving side to side and in the middle something surprising happens"". We try to stay as un-constructed as possible. Usually, most kids start working on the task and quickly drift away, each child to his own style, and this method works great for us. The biggest pitfall is when you show the example projects, most chances are that some kids will try to create a project same as what you showed, so try to keep them simple as possible and without any advanced features like broadcast, variables and so on… If you need anything else, feel free to ask. Good luck Orad"

The first quarter of an hour I'm busy with distributing the cards, after that the children take care of that themselves so I can concentrate on questions raised. I prefer the kids to work in groups of two: pair programming as promoted at Berkeley. Main benefits of using the cards are: everybody gets the same basic knowledge Scratch interface is understood by all To keep the faster kids busy I've got more elaborate lessons at hand.

12388,How to introduce Scratch in 1.5 hours?,4/17/12 0:18,"I would most certainly recommend having the students do the ""about me"" project. It is a great way for students to get exposure and also share information about themselves with each other (especially if you make time for students to walk around and check out each other's projects). It is also really easy to customize based on varrying levels; for advanced students its always fun to challenge them to build-in mini-games or easter eggs into their ""about me"" projects. I have some handouts I have used for this, if you are interested let me know and I can share."

Variables are there as they are the evolution of the ""memory cell"" concept, used at the beginning of programming. With variables you ""take note"" of your environment. In Scratch very often you don't nedd them, as you have sensors and reporters (position x, position y, etc). They give you the possibility to look at your environment, without having to take note by means of a further instrument. Even a score can be managed in Scratch with a ""progress bar"" or by numerical costumes of several sprites. But variables are a very good example and when and way to use a variable. Indeed, a score is really something of which you take note. Every concept of programming should be only introduced when it is convenient and clear with respect to a different solution. And the score, as I said, is a very good example of introducing the concept of variable."

Having had my share of Common Lisp & Scheme, and nowadays dabbling in Scala, I also wish functional programming was more widespread.

47432,Ideas for one hour introduction to Scratch for 8 to 12 year olds,2/9/17 12:17,"Hi all! Thank you for taking the time to read this; I am sorry it is so long, but I am looking for advice, and maybe some critique as to what I did wrong the first time. I am a librarian, NOT really a trained teacher, and I appreciate any help I can get! ?I work for a public library that offers after school and summer S.T.E.A.M.-based classes and programs. Last spring (2016) I was asked to do a one hour introduction to Scratch as a part of this program because our youth director noticed I was helping a few students who had questions about Scratch. I agreed to do the class and put together what I thought would be a great hour for the kids, but it was kind of a chaotic disaster. Here's what I did: ?1) Had them watch a short, exciting introductory video that demonstrated all the fun things you can do with Scratch. (This can be found here: https://vimeo.com/65583694 ?) ?2) Showed them a VERY short powerpoint (2 slides) with a few common coding and Scratch terms. I had students from many backgrounds and skill levels, so I just wanted to make sure we all knew what ""coding"" meant, and what a ""script"" was, etc. There were only 5 terms in the entire powerpoint. ?3) Then we went to Scratch online and played around with some of the shared projects, just so they could see what other people were doing. (We only did this for about 5-7 minutes). ?4) I had them open a blank project and did a quick overview of all the different parts of Scratch (scrpit area, stage, sprites, etc...), which I figured was a good idea since most of the kids had never tried Scratch before. ?5) We then launched in to creating a small game that I had chosen in advance. The game was Star Hunter ?from one of the Scratch books I was using at the time. The title escapes me at the moment, as I was working with about 4 different books. ?6) Then, at the end of the class, I had a whole packet of materials for them to take home: Scratch cards, some free Scratch stickers that I got at a library conference, a new game for them to try, an info sheet for parents, a Scratch book list, and a small vocabulary list to help them understand some of the coding terms they would encounter. ?I HAD PROBLEMS. Phew! As you can imagine, this was a lot to cram into an hour, and we ended up running about an hour and fifteen minutes. This kind of irked some of the parents who were waiting outside of our computer lab to pick up their kids, so I need to trim some of the fat and smooth out some of the ""wrinkles"". Here are the problems I encountered: ?- As I mentioned in the subject line, the class is for ages 8 to 12. I had a really hard time getting this age group to follow what I was doing. They wanted to branch off on thier own right away and some of them made quite a mess of the program we were trying to make. I had to fix these kids' code before we could move on, taking up precious time. ?- They were just not interested in any of the preliminary stuff that I did (#'s 1-4 above). They all sat there, deadpan, looking at me like I had 2 heads. Maybe this is normal for that age group? Should I just scratch those parts completely? Maybe just the video? Shoud I assume these kids are learning these terms at school? Arrrgh!! ?- I thought I had chosen a really cool game for them to make. I was corrected right away (kids are honest like that, eh?). The game took too long to make, they didn't want to be locked into the sprites and backgrounds that I pre-chose to save time, and some of them didn't even bother to try and make the game I selected. I eventually just let those kids create and explore on thier own with the understanding that if they needed my help it would have to be after the class. ?- Being a library, our public computers do not have external speakers. Public users can bring headphones to use, and we have headphones for our adult computer classes, but I was not going to give the 8 - 12 year olds headphones because I figured they would never pay attention to me that way! The kids were all very disappointed that they could add sounds to their project but not near what they sound like. I had a set of speakers that I attached to the admin computer so I could play them examples of the sounds, but this was not fulfilling for them. I don't know what I'm going to do about this. Even if I could scare up 12 sets of speakers for the class, I can only imagine the noise this would create. ?- They were not really interested in the packets I made so I felt like I failed to pique their interest. I know that we are a digital society now, and kids especially so, so maybe they are just not used to getting information this way. Most of the information I put in the take home packets is available online, anyway, so I will probably just skip this next time. Most of the online help I have found so far is for an entire 10-12 week Scratch curriculum. I do not need this much material. Any suggestions? Has anyone else taught a short introductory class like this? ?My thoughts are to cut out the vocab. power point and the Scratch overview (I would just explain as we went) and to then just have a ton of ideas to get the kids started on whatever they feel like making. I could have scratch cards and print off some small projects for the kids to try (if they want), and then just sort of float the room and help them individually. Last time, this is what I ended up doing for most of the class anyway. I think more freedom to create might be a better idea than trying to drag them all through a lengthy peice of Scratch code. Thoughts on this plan? ?Thank you so very much if you have made it this far. This is a long shot cry for help (lol), and I am sure that I will figure out something for them to do... but I thought if someone with more experience could weigh-in that it might help me."

47432,Ideas for one hour introduction to Scratch for 8 to 12 year olds,2/10/17 13:13,"I hope so, too Nate! ?I have pretty much decided against trying to drag them all through another whole set of specific game code. In my experience, they get distracted, don't listen because they're too busy trying out their own ideas, and you end up having to stop the class, fix and/or delete everything they're trying to add to the code, and then back up two or three steps because they didn't catch what you were talking about while they were making ten different colored sprites. LOL. ?I am strongly leaning toward more creative freedom for the class, but I am not really sure how to implement such a plan without resulting in pure chaos. An hour is probably not enough time to help 10 or 12 students with individual projects. Add to that the fact that we are not creating individual accounts for these kids (we are leaving that up to the parents if the kids want to pursue Scratch after the class) so they can't save any of their work.

Something I've noticed about the activities in books, is that they seem more aimed at kids sitting at home, in a one-on-one setting, with more than an hour to read through. For your 1) rather than showing them a video, it could be just as easy to get them to actually make their own example. It keeps everyone engaged, and you can see those that get stuck straight away, and help them get their code working too. For this, you'd just want to have your screen up on a projector, and then have everyone follow along. It doesn't have to be really involved, just a simple loop. The one I've seen done well, is hooking in sound or visual input into movement of a sprite: look under 'Sensing' for 'loudness' or 'video' blocks. That will give them an fairly instant gratification. For those that it works, suggest a challenge e.g. changing sprites, or altering the code to see what happens, and while they're engaged with that, you can help others fix their code. At this point, there's not going to be a ton of debugging, but getting everyone's example working is really important so that they feel some achievement. With debugging though, just make sure you vocalise what you're doing, to keep kids engaged. The first time they jump ahead of you and say something like ""oh, I had the wrong value there"" is a huge step. Seeing as you don't have speakers and possibly not microphones and cameras available, what about starting with replicating a single scratch card for them to follow along with? They can group together to make a full game or project, and that would allow kids to grab one that they need for an idea. For instance, there's the scratch card that shows how to make a piece of clothing snap into the right position when dragged to a sprite. Something else that worked for us was to have a handout for kids to have a Scratch account before coming to the first 1 hour session. This meant that some had already had a play, but that they could also save their progress. In this day of tablets and mobile devices, kids relate this to when they can save game progress, and I've found it can be harder to get them motivated the next time, when they realise they have to re-create their project again. They'll also have something to 'take home' and show off, but also to build on later. One activity that has worked really well for my classes, is to show the kids how to do faux gravity, for a very very simple platform game. Once they have a character that they can move with keys and will sit on top of a 'level' they'll essentially be able to create their own game. We sometimes have done this, and then get the kids to go and play each other's games. With this, one thing to watch for, is that it's easy to have too ambitious a game idea, and then kids become frustrated when they realise how much code is needed. A good way to have a set scope, is just get the kids to draw a square on a piece of paper, put in some stick figures, and have a basic idea drawn out visually. That way, there's a defined scope for their first milestone i.e. reproducing their design in Scratch. Tell them to keep it real simple, as they can add extras once it is working. The important thing is that it works first. Then make sure you already have the extra features in your back pocket, so to speak. E.g. before the class, sit down and work out easy ways to do features such as score, change a one-player game to a two-player game (copy the first sprite and its code, then modify the code for the second player controls), or changing the game to make it multi level (change the background and player location when a goal sprite is collided with). To summarize: - do the activities yourself so that you know any gotchas beforehand (always helps to say, oh I ran into this one too) - try to get them making things straight away so they're not bored - verbalize any troubleshooting you do so they see the thought process and stay involved - keep the activity simple - allow them a way to save their work so they can show it off and add to it later - set simple challenges, and have something up your sleeve for the more advanced kids (there's always some) so you can help others troubleshoot This is my first reply so I'm trying to type fast enough that it wont time out :) Hope this helps.. justaboutfine"
47432,Ideas for one hour introduction to Scratch for 8 to 12 year olds,2/13/17 13:23,"justaboutfine, ?Thank you so much! I love the idea of having them set up accounts before the class! In fact, I already emailed our youth director and asked her to add this to the registration process. I felt really bad last time because they had to scrap thier whole game; I made one and posted it on Scratch for those who wanted to add on to it later, but a lot of them had customized their backdrops and sprites to make it more ""theirs"", and in that respect they would have had to redo some things. ?I like a lot of your ideas, actually! I wish that we had more classes so I can see what the kids come up with on thier own. I did request that they bring their own, simple ideas in the class description, so hopefully I'll have some that are ready to go with ideas so that I can help the ones that need it more. I wholly expect to have all different levels of experience. I will definately be using the scratch cards as you suggested. Having them start with a simple idea and then build from there sounds much more productive then dragging them all through a game they are not really interested in. ?I will post my final curriculum (for one hour - LOL) here, and also let everyone know how my (now second) attempt went! ?Amy C."

5232,Information behavior of Scratchers (Call for research participants with compensation),9/5/10 10:01,"Hi, I am Kyungwon Koh, a doctoral candidate in School of Library and Information Studies at Florida State University. My research areas include youth information behavior, information literacy, and library and information services/resources for youth. I am writing this to introduce my current research on Scratchers’ information-related behaviors, and also ask your help in recruiting study participants. I found Scratch to be an exemplary place to observe new and innovative youth information behavior—i.e., the ways kids seek, evaluate, use, share, and create information—to enhance their learning or pursue personal and aesthetic growth in the digital age. I am currently conducting my dissertation research, which aims to illuminate innovative patterns of youth information behavior in the digital age, with particular focus on the ways youth interact with technologies to access and use information and to create new knowledge. As part of the research, I am investigating information behaviors of Scratchers, which I believe are prerequisites for participating effectively in Scratch activities. I am seeking young people with various ages under 19 who have participated in Scratch for individual interviews. ·       Preference: Youth who have worked to create Scratch project cooperatively ·       When: October 2010 at a time convenient to interview participants ·       Where and how: o   Face to face interviews for Boston area youth o   Online interviews for other areas (via Instant Messaging, Skype, or other online communication tools) ·       Benefits: $20 gift card per interview participant and educator who helps recruiting their kids (e.g., by distributing and collecting parent consent form and youth assent form) I am attending Scratch@MIT this August, and hoping that I can meet any of you who are interested in my study.

27223,Integrating language and arts with MIT scratch programming,5/14/14 5:05,"For surviving in 21st century, one needs to think critically and creatively, embrace diversity and tolerate ambiguity, create as well as consume information. Many of these skills can be developed through the innovative use of computers in art subjects like drawing, painting, music etc. and natural language.  Arts education promotes work habits that cultivate curiosity, imagination, creativity and communication skills.  Students who possess these skills are better able to tolerate and tackle ambiguity, explore new realms of possibility, express their own thoughts and feelings and understand the perspective of others.  Students’ capacity to create and express themselves through arts is one of the central qualities that make the human, as well as a basis for success in the 21st century.  But the new technologies have been largely absent in art education at school level.  The current education curriculum focuses on fairly latest but, difficult to understand category of programming languages.  So am trying to make a research paper on  how the language and arts can be integrated using MIT’s Scratch environment? is that possible."

Looking to integrate Scratch with my math classes and no idea where to start. I don't want to limit scratch in class with just math related concepts either. I think the computational thinking that Scratch is said to help develop in students IS the math that I am attempting to teach. So I envision starting this process by trying to hook my students with a cool application first (an animation, a game, etc...), and then eventually having them do traditional math things with it (graphing, plotting, etc...). Maybe we should form some sort of group for teachers integrating this into their classes, especially for the first time. Is that possible on here?"

Andrea Ange- How to use Scratch outside of the CS curriculum? Debbie Corleto- Create their own live animated comic book for middle school art. AA- How to get other teachers on board? Karen Eutemey- Knowing what other teachers are doing is very helpful. Frank Abbot- There are the physical hurdles: computers for teachers, time for personal development before implementation in class, feeling like they are ready and giving them technical support while they use the tool. DC- Computer and art people are most likely to use this first. Barbara Sanchez- I teach French and computer science, so I created a model of famous monument in Paris. Have them do a little walking tour… they will have to do some linear stepping through backgrounds… KE- Likes to work with groups of kids and have them work with projects that they are working in conjunction with… then the group has the final say would be whichever child might be responsible for each component. BS- Advisor for the 21st Century Literacy class which is funny because there are a million definitions for this out there. Who’s to say what that literacy should include? But I can see using this in class. FA- In the lab they have online lessons. Scratch might be an alternative assignment instead of a PowerPoint, they can use scratch to be the presentation format…You can verify that with the CS teacher, there must be at least one computer for every two kids…. KE We have a lab and carts with laptops you can sign up to be in the lab, or you can sign out a laptop. DC – Nothing worked last year but now getting them on it and I do want to collaborate just because I’m new to it I’m going to have to go through the curriculum to get people into it. FA I have mixed feelings about the projects, but they will get caught up in the minutia of the programming part. KE They’re computer teacher starts working with them in fourth grade in scratch. DC Do I do it with all of them so they are all working on it all three years? BS- You mean you get them for all three years? That’s great! Michelle Chung- What if you did a combo pack? What if you took the tour of the museum, and what if you expanded that into creating a tour of different areas in small groups? If they are working in groups or pairs… Different pieces can be dropped into a combined program. AA- Because there is the import function MC- You can do what Lorraine is doing which is very macro with her world museum. BS- I introduce it by giving my students one card a week for the kids that want to go faster since I have taught High School Computer Science I could get into other stuff. AA-Some of the ideas I am hearing are cartooning, creating video type works, mapping areas, creating games and really first we have to find teachers that are interested and either do a formal workshop or reach out to the project based learners in your schools and work with them… BC- Bring them in and work in collaboration. KE- the foreign language teachers can use this as an assessment tool... the kids get five points for the getting the response correct and the recording option is also very neat… MC- You can actually change the language of Scratch. Click on the globe and change it to the language you are teaching… FA- Do you collect data on who is still using it from the workshops? MC- Not formal but what we have been seeing is a lot of people continue to use the website and forums for discussion. We break but I’m sure that more ideas are out there for integrating this into the whole school. Please post your ideas in response to our discussion!"

With that said, I am just starting to think about how I can use Scratch with High School students, so I am open to all suggestions."

I am planning to volunteer at a local library to introduce 4th and 5th grade children to Scratch 2.0. We'll have one hour in the computer lab to use. I have read some of the other discussions with great interest, and am considering the use of ""scratch cards"" or a modified version of the introduction of the curriculum.

21100,Introduce Scratch to 4th and 5th graders in one hour,8/13/13 12:55,"I highly suggest using the Scratch Cards.  It gives them enough ""to be dangerous"" in Scratch.

Each children would select a song, get the lyrics (both download from internet) and program a sprite (also they could download photos of the singers) to move, change apariences and control the speaking (music and lyrics together). In this way, they could create their own video-clip, a real final product ready to show and share with others. Probably when the children go back home, they will try to develop new versions or new video-clips and they would want to know more about Scratch, how to insert different effects, movements, ... they would be inside the creative spiral. Perhaps, would be a great idea to offer them a way to attend questions after the workshop finished. Also, before the workshop, you can comment to children that they have to select a song with the lyrics. There they will learn to make video-clips they could share in internet. Hope this help, Jon Bustillo"

2190,Introducing STEM into curriculum,1/6/10 11:57,"""Hi, I'm working with the Illinois governor's Economic Recovery Commission.  My task is to develop recommendations for improving the quality of education, particulary STEM education, for our students.  I'm looking for suggestions on how to address potential challenges in introducing SCRATCH -- limited access to PC's, teachers who may be uncomfortable with new technology, and/or administrators may not immediately appreciate the benefit of the resource.   If you've encountered (and overcome) any of these would love to hear from you.  Thanks Pam"
2190,Introducing STEM into curriculum,1/7/10 15:27,"One of the challenges you mention -- teachers' comfort w/technology -- is a common theme that emerges in the Scratch professional development work I do. Some teachers have expressed that they feel uncomfortable not knowing ""everything"" about Scratch and worry that their students might consequently have unsatisfying experiences. It's great when this worry dissipates, which often happens when we get to hands-on activities and when we discuss (and try) peer-learning strategies. I've had numerous teachers share their creative approaches to collaboration as a means of supporting student learning (and reducing expectations of teacher-as-expert!)"
2190,Introducing STEM into curriculum,1/8/10 10:28,"Hi Pam, I just conducted a qualitative study that showed that students can learn Scratch - 28 different types of tasks on their own. These students were 3rd grade students from a blended (special education and general education background). The kids learned from each other by doing - see Papert and Constructionism. - http://www.papert.org/articles/SituatingConstructionism.html I have been working with teachers for over 15 years and for 15 years - we have had the same problems - convincing teachers to teach with or about technology.  So perhaps we should let kids learn and bypass the teachers. I am working with two teachers right now who use learning centers and one of the centers enables students to learn Scratch on their own or with peers. My study stemmed from the Hole-in-the-Wall studies where kids in the slums and countrysides of India learned computer literacy skills on their own. My paper  - http://btcactus.blogspot.com/2010/01/if-they-dont-test-you-on-it.html - if you feel like reading my qualitative findings. The Hole-in-the-Wall studies: http://www.hole-in-the-wall.com/findings.html Kids can learn Scratch without teachers - so let the reluctant teachers  continue to be reluctant and get this great software into the hands of kids! P.S.  I run all my Scratch workshops and sessions with Scratch on USB drives - skipping the now-reluctant - technicians from having to install Scratch on the hard drives.  Enabling Scratch to run on portable drives is a great idea - thanks MIT folks."

2190,Introducing STEM into curriculum,1/10/10 9:32,"One technical problem that gives me headaches is updated versions of software.  Our school has classroom machines, two labs, media center mini lab, and a cart of laptops.  I am not the tech person and don't have permissions to add software to anything but the laptops.  I think we've got it under control now, but for a couple years, I couldn't count on any given machine having the current version of Scratch installed.  [No, not quite under control.  Last week a teacher came to me unable to shut down her laptop because she couldn't figure out how to quit Scratch.  She had the old version with the Squeak menu bar.] The perennial scheduling issue, not enough minutes in the day for everything you'd like to do, is particularly true as the reading/math testing pressures mount. The windows for Scratch integration possibilities narrowed this year when our district moved to a uniform reading block curriculum and structure. We also added a ""response to intervention"" half hour for skills work, that came out of time previously given to STEM and social studies work. Everything is important, but unless we fund a longer school day, what gets measured publically will be given priority. Karen R"

The book seems to follow the conventional path to structured programming and doesn't touch on objects at all. In other words, this is a C textbook written in Scratch. He does discuss procedures (ch.4) and recursion (briefly in ch.7), if that helps. All the best --Louis"

Scratch makes Math real (ie: coordinate planes) Create an online video of kids talking about what Scratch is and why they enjoy working with it, fast-paced cuts/integrated with Mitch Resnick/ScratchEd commentary - 5 minute ""teaser"" type of video Scratch promotes explanatory discourse naturally. Learning by creating is more powerful than just consuming! Smile the whole time and use the words ""STEM programming"". Don't be afraid to allow your child to join the Scratch community. Interest-driven application of math, science, and imagination Scratch can be liberating for learners who are non-traditonal. Start by presenting compelling Scratch game for them to play, then remix! Can build Scratch projects as a family Tell them it was developed by MIT. Benefits of Scratch: creativity, intro to programming, critical thinking, problem solving, computational thinking, etc. Benefits of online account: collaboration, authentic audience, feedback The Scratch website is a great place for your kids to learn through the examples of others.

41679,JSON Project Idea - Make Sense?,4/12/16 14:09,For a HS class I am considering the following: Build a Scratch Project Download the JSON and associated files Reverse Engineer the JSON - Explain in SImple English What is Going On (It is this understanding I am after) Edit the JSON and Upload and Demonstrate Change Students are Java Script literate. Does this make any sense? Thanks

23861,Kids getting too frustrated?,11/18/13 15:39,I am so bummed out that I had two students (6th grade) drop out of my SCRATCH group. We only had a few lessons and they just gave up. :( I am talking with the rest of group (6 of them) and trying to get their feedback about it and I htink the rest are in but still I am reevaluating what I can do to not make this so overwhleming. I am using the Curriculum provided by MIT but I do not have enough time to do the entire lesson at school (I see them every 6 days for 30 minutes) so I use Edmodo (web app) to deliver some of the lessons. I have explained to them that it is like learning a new langauge and you cannot expect to learn Spansih in one day--so just be patienct and it will come! I had them use the All About Me page for guidance on next lesson and I am not going to push them too much with completing the design notebook. I do realize kids have a lot going on at heme and at school and because this is a pilot project it is hard to retrofit this into their busy schedule. Any suggestions or ideas will be appreciated!

Has anyone else had a similar experience? One of my students figured out that a hand keeps a connection with the Leap Motion better than a finger but in another game being built, two fingers work to move two characters in a game but two hands cause confusion as they overlap too easily."

25517,Learn to Program with Scratch; a new book,4/4/14 19:30,"This is a really great book! I have been teaching Scratch to elementary-level students for a couple of years, and have tried to purchase or review nearly every book on Scratch that I can get my hands on. This is truly one of the best books I have reviewed. It contains many examples and projects that I can present to the students as a group, or have them try on their own. Some of the examples are simple enough to illustrate just enough of what I'm trying to teach (for example, how to use the Stamp tool), or lengthy enough to present as a challenge that encompasses multiple types of blocks or processes for a great learning experience. I appreciate the step-by-step projects and the visual guidance. If my classes were longer, I would certainly use this book as the ""text book"" to follow. As it stands now, my 6-week/once-per-week courses don't quite allow for that kind of depth, but I am able to extract many of the books samples to offer quite a lot of breadth into my courses. This book also really takes a Scratch user from the basic concepts of programming that is so available even to the casual Scratcher, to truly deeper concepts (such as nested loops, recursion, physics and advanced equations). I have yet to follow through with experiencing every page of this book, but my intent is to do so, as I'm certain it will put me in better shape to help my students and to develop my curriculum toward continually advancing my students' programming abilities and understanding."

Personally I have extensive undergrad academic experience with Java, although I don't have the mindset for it and dislike programming. I am not very good at it. However, at the 8th grade level I think that I could get by. Is Scratch something that I could use to introduce students to the concepts of programming? I have also heard about Alice. What are the main differences between Scratch and Alice? If Scratch is for me, how do I go about getting some training / direction so that I could develop a few units in programming for my class? We are limited to about 10 weeks per class. I’m not sure if I could get approval to spend the full 10 weeks on programming. Do you have a recommended amount of time that I could get through a good unit or two with a nice deliverable or project to show for the efforts at the end? The Computer Studies program has traditionally had a bad reputation among students. I am trying to find some way to make it more interesting to students, especially at the 8th grade level. Typically, projects they can do with minimal talking from me is ideal. This class should be fun!

9554,Learning to Teach Programming using Scratch,4/18/11 12:16,"Short answer is yes, there are ways to connect Scratch to programming.  I'm not seeing how to post documents to this forum so the following links may be of interest: 1) Scratch / Alice / Greenfoot / Java topics and a path through freely available tools: - https://files.me.com/javageek/c5sk7y (461KB PDF) 2) Scratch to Greenfoot - using a game as an example of programming concepts from Scratch to Java - https://files.me.com/javageek/pe88f7 (7MB PDF) I usually suggest that not all students will want to become programmers, any more than each person that likes to look at stars will want to become a professional telescope builder.  We need people skilled in building telescopes and using telescopes, but a lot of people will simply want to enjoy the end result and the ability to peer into the universe at their fingertips.  Correspondingly, it's important for students to understand how programming works and examples like Scratch extended to BYOB (http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs10/sp11/) for CS Principles (http://csprinciples.org) pilot courses as introduction to programming and computer science, those are good examples of Scratch as a ""low floor"" entry point for the topics.  I'm very interested in the problem solving skills and creativity it takes to go from a blank (scratch, alice, greenfoot, other...) project to a working game, simulation or story that's fun and/or useful.  There are programming and problem solving pieces that go into making that game, story or simulation, and you can certainly get students started on that path with Scratch, and continue on to various programming topics as part of the problem solving / creative objectives."

We all Scratchers owe a lot of good experiences and learning to Scratch. Why not celebrate Scratch's 5th birthday by sending birthday messages as Scratch project? In ""World Museum"", which is a world-wide network of collaborators, we are creating a large animation (we will use a modified version of Scratch with 1280x720 stage size) with birthday messages from all around the world. We would like to invite everyone to contribute a message. Please take a look at World Scratch Birthday Project. We have just put messages by some people to give you an image of what it will look like. Many balloons will be floating, and if you click a balloon, it will pop and say a birthday message for Scratch. I hope you will be interested in joining us. It is very easy to contribute: just draw your own balloon and write a birthday message. See the World Scratch Birthday Project page for how you can send your message to Scratch."
12743,"Let's celebrate Scratch's Birthday - join World Scratch Birthday Project, online!",5/17/12 6:51,"This was a great project for us to be involved in. I heard about scratch four years ago and was keen to get use it with my classes, but I did not know enough about it. Over the years, I have started and then hit a brick wall due to lack of confidence and knowledge. However this project was great. The fact my grade 4/5 class could download the balloon with accompanying code, meant they could customize the balloon easily taste, fix up their code should they have altered any of it and complete the task in a lesson. They loved the 'popping' nature of the balloons. This has inspired me and my classes to keep playing with Scratch. Thanks again and Happy Birthday, Scratch! Anne Mirtschin, Australia"

One limiting factor was Scratch's stage size, and whether I can run a program using the whole screen area or almost all of the available PC/Tablet work area. Scratch's stage size, as I learned and researched through many different forums messages, is described as basicly fixed, or so I believed until I saw the above posting by Yoshiro Miyata, mentioning a ""modified version of Scratch with 1280x720 stage size"". I would like to be able to use such version, and will be thankful for anyone who can point me in the right direction for getting a file for installation on PC and/or Android. Thanks, Uzi Notev"
12743,"Let's celebrate Scratch's Birthday - join World Scratch Birthday Project, online!",9/1/12 3:39,"Dear Uzi Notev, This is Yoshiro Miyata.  Yes, I think the large stage size gives Scratch more expressive power. A friend of mine, Manabu Sugiura of Tsuda College in Tokyo, modified the Scratch source code and created the Scratch with resizable stage size. We have been using it for many of our projects in World Museum, a network of people around the world collaborating to create projects that are meaningful for everyone involved.  The large stage size has been very useful, not oly because we can make beautiful projects, but also because it gives the children around the world (more than 200 kids in 10 countries in some projects) the experience of contributing to the collaborative efforts of so many people from around the world. We thought it will be useful for many people, so you can now download it from here!  (If the page is displayed in other language, try ""translations"")  Hope you will enjoy it!  If you have any questions or problems, just let us know."

Your work for advancing collaboration seems to me to be a source of pride and satisfaction! As for Scratch - the resizable stage size seems to me like BIG news for the 'Scratching' community. I really hope it is adopted as a baseline for further developments. I already downloaded the zip file, and hope to 'give it a go' tomorrow. From my 1st look at the license.txt text file, I got the impression that it may be MAC (Apple) oriented and hope itdoesn't rule out running on Windows , and I assume I may have to look further for some setup instructions, so I'm going to take a second look into the dowloaded file tomorrow...

It is not currently possible to add existing Scratch accounts to a classroom. As a workaround, you may want to consider following existing Scratchers and have them follow you, your students, and your class studios (existing Scratch accounts can curate class studios as well). This way, you and your students (student accounts as well as existing Scratch accounts) can be aware of each others' activity on the site. I hope this helps!"

This was the first time many of our students used Scratch, and they all picked up on it very well! I designed a tiger for them to use with the program because our school mascot is a tiger, and the book centers around a stuffed animal bunny.

42756,Looking for Scratch programs to teach standard subjects,5/25/16 17:58,"Most educators seem to be using Scratch to teach computer science and programming skills.  However, I'm looking for something a little different - Scratch programs to teach standard primary school subjects like math, science, ESL, geography, etc.  I'm also hoping to find programs that can serve as self-teaching lessons of these standard subjects without requiring any teacher input. I'd like to create an extensive collection of top-quality Scratch programs.  There are some such programs available on the Scratch website, but sorting through everything and testing the programs to find sophisticated, top-quality lessons is extremely time-consuming. I'd like to know if anybody has put together such a collection already or is interested in helping create one.  I'm also looking for volunteers interested in helping to create sophisticated lessons that use good teaching strategies to teach standard subjects for grades K-7. BACKGROUND:  I run a very small nonprofit that works with primary schools in remote villages in Lesotho (Africa) where there are few teachers and the quality of teaching is extremely poor.  There are usually 50-70 students per classroom and one teacher may teach up to three grades, so students get virtually no individual attention or feedback.  Practically all the students lag 3-4 grade levels behind U.S. standards. We've set up locally-run programs that use laptops as an educational tool, not only to supplement the teachers' work but also to help the children teach themselves, requiring little or no assistance from their teachers. CONSTRAINTS: We are currently using refurbished One Laptop Per Child XO-1 laptops, run by solar panels.  We'd hoped the software that came with the XO laptops would be sufficient for students to learn on their own, but we've found it grossly inadequate.  There is no internet available in the area, so we cannot use web-based resources.  The XO laptops have a unique Linux operating system called Sugar.  Because of this, many existing programs and resources will not run on the laptops.  Fortunately, Scratch does run on them, though they only have Scratch 1.4 right now. USING SCRATCH:  None of our volunteers are trained computer programmers, but some of them can use Scratch.  We'ved decided Scratch is the easiest tool for us to use to reach our goal, which is eventually to create an entire curriculum of self-teaching, interactive computer lessons. We've created a limited number of lessons so far.  We've found that, because the lessons offer instant feedback the students have never gotten before, their' skills improve quickly and dramatically when they use these lessons. That's why I'm asking for your help.  It's an ambitious project, but I think it's worthwhile.  And hopefully, it is something that can be used by children and schools in other developing nations that also don't have access to the internet."

50603,Make a Block suggestions,6/15/17 1:06,"I have two related suggestions The first is to extend the ""make a block"" idea to allow Scratchers to make an operation. For example it would be nice to be able to create an operation with four inputs the x and y coordinates for two points, that would output the distance between the two points.I am certain that many people would find this feature useful. My second suggestion is that Scratchers be able to save a ""toolbox"" of blocks (and hopefully operstions} that they have created. Then we would not have to reinvent the wheel each time we found a need for a tool we have already created. This would allow people to share their tools in the same way that we share projects. Other Scratchers would have the opportuntiy to use and remix custom blocks and operations. As they rated these tools the most popular and useful ones would rise to the top in the same way as so many things are crowd rated on the internet. i have no idea how difficult these features would be to implement, but I hope you agree that they would be a welcome addition to the Scratch environment."

The sounds were not as long as the original English and the further into the decription pages, the more out of sync things got. I found the the program had static timed breakpoints that of course didn't fit the new audio. So I rearranged the programming so that it would get each audio chunk and WAIT for it to finish. This makes it very easy to update sound files without problems. If you would like to try the code see: http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/2964963/"
17039,March 2013 Meetup Discussion Notes: Supporting students and teachers using Scratch,3/12/13 10:34,"At the March 2013 Scratch educator meetup at MIT, attendees participated in a group discussion to share lesson plan ideas, strategies, and approaches for supporting students using Scratch as well as for introducing Scratch to colleagues and other teachers in professional development settings. For supporting students... harlem shake! start small and test often! encourage project sharing and remixing what would a book report look like in Scratch? independent, personal instruction: creating short videos describing key elements of Scratch that can be embedded or available to students when there are Scratch questions, utilize the resource available (ie: Google your Scratch question) letting students capture themselves in pictures or videos to share their personal interests, skills, goals get started with sensors using the microphone (ie: the loudness/loud? block) animate the students' concert song for using Scratch + WeDo,  start small: 1 sprite, 1 sensor assessment ideas: badges, rubrics, interviews incorporate classroom assignments (ie: create a maze of the digestive system) For supporting teachers... make it practical: engage educators in lesson planning, make Scratch relevant for their classes have a beginner's mind hijack the class, but let the teacher stay in the room and have them participate along with their students leverage students as teachers/mentors What other suggestions do you have?"

41437,Maryland ScratchEd Meetup Recap,4/1/16 12:30,"On March 19, Dianne O'Grady Cunniff organized and hosted the first-ever Maryland ScratchEd Meetup at Charles County High School, in Waldorf, MD, with help from her colleague, Joe Greenawalt. 24 educators participated in the event, from 3rd grade teachers, to high school CS instructors, to librarians. After a Bingo ice-breaker and introductions, participants contributed to the day's schedule with their passions, interests, and questions. Dianne combined participant ideas with a few pre-planned sessions, and the schedule for the day became: Elementary Learners CS First Club Finch Robots Scratch Projects CS Framework In the Elementary Learners session, teachers shared projects their students had created: In the Finch Robots session, Dianne invited to participants to tinker with Scratch scripts to make the robots move, change colors and say something. No one in the group had used the robots before but after 45 minutes, everyones robots were boistrously moving around the floor, saying hilarious lines like, ""Take me to your leader"" as their ""noses"" lit up. After the meetup, Dianne sent out this note to participants. Thank you to all 24 of you who came, participated and helped out to make a very interesting and worthwhile Scratch meet-up today!

39100,Massachusetts Draft Standards for Digital Literacy and Computer Science,12/21/15 12:02,"The Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education has released a draft of the Digital Literacy and Computer Science Standards (DL&CS). These draft standards will be released for public comment in January. Four features distinguish the draft DL&CS Standards: The DL&CS Standards are organized into four strands: Computing and Society, Digital Tools and Collaboration, Computing Systems, and Computational Thinking. The DL&CS Standards progress coherently from grades K to 12. The standards emphasize a focused and coherent progression of knowledge and skills. As students progress through their K-12 education, they acquire increasingly sophisticated knowledge, skills, and dispositions in digital literacy and computer science. The DL&CS Standards articulate practices necessary for success. The practices cultivate the internalization of dispositions that skillful people in digital literacy and computer science apply in reasoning, creation, and problem solving. Practices speak to the types of performance students should be able to demonstrate. The DL&CS Standards complement other Massachusetts Curriculum Frameworks. The curriculum frameworks and DL&CS Standards overlap in meaningful and substantive ways and offer an opportunity for all students to better apply and learn digital literacy and computer science. Much of the knowledge, skills, and dispositions central to digital literacy and computer science, such as computational thinking, also apply to other subjects, including, but not limited to, science, technology and engineering and mathematics. You can download the standards on the Massachusetts DESE page."

401,math & physics resources,7/26/09 14:29,"hello, i am diving into scratch and i hope to be ready before september begins, in order to start 1 or 2 courses for kids in my school; now, my question: i already know scratch is totally helpful in math and physics teaching but i'd like to know if there is any book or web resource where projects regarding these curricula are grouped by age or grades of kids or, better, math (or physics) topics, e.g.: - algebra projects - geometry projects - calculus projects etc. more exactely, i mean that you may find hundreds of projects tagged math or physics in the scratch site but they span a very different level of complexity and so i have to check each of them one by one ... maybe a finer tuned tagging could help in this view, like: math/geometry math/basic_arithmetic math/algebra and the same for physics thank you in advance ps: if my question is not clear, just ask me more details"
401,math & physics resources,8/1/09 16:36,"Hello, I am not aware of a resource that does what you ask.  You are right on about there needing to be such a thing, so somehow us teachers need to figure out how to make it happen. I  wonder if there is interest in a collective project along these lines through August--if we can recruit several people willing do take an area for searching the scratch site, then agree on a protocal for entering references here.  Would you be interested? Karen R."
401,math & physics resources,8/15/09 12:52,I'm interested in using Scratch to teach elementary math concepts in my classroom. I'll be exploring that this coming year.
401,math & physics resources,8/21/09 19:15,"Dear all, My goal in Scratch and before that for the last 20 years has been to develop real and virtual games and activities to teach and expose basic math and science (mostly math) to students in K-8 We have started a Team called The Super School Team with ffred, dapontes and mathjp The Numbers Gallery is one of the first Programs. I have also been working with Karen's class. I have grouped some of my work (almost all for teaching elemetry math) into the following galleries I am all for coming up with ways to make these and all math and science projects in Scratch more accessiable to teachers. Graphing Calculator Series (mostly done for Karen's class then I added other projects that I found) http://scratch.mit.edu/galleries/view/34684 K-2 http://scratch.mit.edu/galleries/view/39051 3-5 http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/DrSuper/471789 6-8 http://scratch.mit.edu/galleries/view/38250 Quick Math http://scratch.mit.edu/galleries/view/30594 QuicK Science http://scratch.mit.edu/galleries/view/30723 Puzzles http://scratch.mit.edu/galleries/view/33210 Dr. Supers Math and Science Games and Activities http://scratch.mit.edu/galleries/view/23437 I have gone through most of the 600+ projects in Math Projects Gallery http://scratch.mit.edu/galleries/view/6423 We need a few criteria to classify these and identify the ones that can be used in the classroom."
401,math & physics resources,8/23/09 16:53,"For Teachers to find projects in scratch that they can use in their class rooms we need to identify the content and the quality of the project for classroom use. We need to have a roup that is charged with this task and we can start with the Gallery Math Projects that contains most of the math related projects for Content we need a Hierarchy: Grade (K-2, 3-5, 6-8, 9-12) Strand (Number Sense, Measurement, Geometric Sense, Probability and Statistics, Algebraic Sense) Topic Subtopic For Quality we can use an A, B, C, D, F scale to determine the qulity and classroom usability of the project. Karen Can this be added to ScratchED or is it somehow in ScratchED already?"
401,math & physics resources,8/23/09 6:51,This is a bug how can we remove these I save once and I got several copies
401,math & physics resources,8/23/09 7:35,"I've deleted the extra copies. I haven't seen that behavior. Did you click ""save"" only once and wait for it to reload? What browser were you using?"
401,math & physics resources,8/23/09 16:48,Yes I only pressed enter and this happened (I think) I did not save that many times for sure. IE 7 in PC (Vista)
401,math & physics resources,8/23/09 16:54,It's definitely strange behavior! I'll keep an eye on it -- thanks for the usage information.
401,math & physics resources,8/23/09 17:05,"You can add Scratch projects (or links to projects and galleries) as resources on ScratchEd. Resources can be described by the site taxonomy (age, content type, curricular area) or folksonomy (community-supplied keywords). Between the two of these you should be able to describe the grade and strand. As for quality indicators, the idea of resource rating systems was brought up in another thread. For now, comments (and the resource description itself) can be used to describe the quality and usability of the project. For example, I added a resource about stories. It's a collection of projects that I think are great examples of using Scratch for storytelling. Hope that helps, Karen"
401,math & physics resources,8/23/09 21:54,"I know in theory that the current labels should allow us to make a hierarchy, but it feels complicated and hard to organize.  I agree with Behrouz about having topics and subtopics in a list that an educator can easily navigate when browsing.  It is the same sort of wish that I have for project galleries.  It would be lovely to be able to organize them with nesting folders or links inside links."
401,math & physics resources,8/23/09 21:58,"OK, I see how you did the story project grouping.  Imagine, though, that someone else wants to add to the collection.  Then later on the collection gets organized by projects that build from one concept to the next.  Then someone wants to insert a project into the middle of the collection because it fits better there.  Is that possible in the current set-up? Karen R."
401,math & physics resources,8/24/09 8:01,"Oh, I think I understand what you're trying to do. ScratchEd was designed to be flexible across lots of different types of resources, which makes it hard to have that sort of hierarchical specificity. Two ideas come to mind. I guess you could either: (1) be flexible about the way you imagine the collection being presented (e.g. across resources instead of building one resource up) and use ScratchEd, or (2) use another tool to construct your collection (e.g. like a wiki to generate a taxonomy with as much nesting as you like) and then point to it from ScratchEd. What do you think? Do you have other ideas? It's a great project -- let me know how I can help!"
401,math & physics resources,8/25/09 12:14,"yes, Karen, i share your view; moreover, i'd like to place our discussion in the mind of a teacher working in whatever school in the world (isn't that Scratch is intended to ?) and let's ask ourselves: what does this man/woman need to let Scratch land in his/her classroom ? 1. he/she should be sufficiently experienced with the language (a lot has already been written ) 2. after that the question is: well, i have to teach this topic to these kids of this age in this country, is there anything out there to help me ? the teacher may be really busy so he/she goes quickly through web resources, looking for what is in order; if this is the goal a web resource for Scratch should satisfy, a good starting point could be the structure of the geogebra wiki page, which i use a lot (i'm very sorry, i do not know how to add the hyperlink here): http://www.geogebra.org/en/wiki/index.php/English#Mathematics:_High_School topics are neatly organized, a teacher may go and search easily, people around the world may contribute and so on ... as you already know; take a look and share your view thank you again for the work you're doing"
401,math & physics resources,8/28/09 7:48,"I would have hoped that the Wiki would stay in ScratchEd and be managed by a editor group we already have a few candidates for this group. They will decide who gets to insert what where. Search and being able to limit it with the Tags that I mentioned would have been so much easier. Even if we had a search that would keep limiting the set of projects that would help. So a teacher like Karen could search for 6-8 then for Geometry then Coordinates. I suggest for now just to test the water: 1.  We divide up the Projects in the Math Gallery and Give them a Quality ranking like Quality A, Quality B for those that can be used in the classroom (there maybe 100+ of these) . 2. Then assign Grade Strand, Topics and Subtopics to these."
401,math & physics resources,9/3/09 22:42,"Here is another thought about how to approach this project.  Most math curriculum design these days starts from a set of standards, in particular the National Council for Teachers of Mathematics.  This is the link to their tables of standards for grades 6-8, for example.  http://standards.nctm.org/document/chapter6/alg.htm How about choosing a level like this, putting the table in a wiki, then adding a column to the table that has Scratch project demonstrations, project assignments, or projects that use the concept?  Teachers could check the standard they need to teach and see what sorts of projects address it.  Problems with this--there are a lot of standards, the language of standards can be dense, projects fit more than one standard ... Karen R."
401,math & physics resources,9/10/09 14:05,"Hi Karen (R.), thank you for the link you highlighted ! I think it fits almost perfectly what i had in mind. More exactely, my proposal may be told as follows: pretend to be a math teacher in grade 7 (or whatever else), preparing one (or more than one) algebra class consider choose one (or more than one) item of the left column for ""Expectations"" standards each of these elements (expanded or not into their more detailed right column version) should report links to Scratch projects that the committee (let's call it this way, freely change it if you disagree) has identified as fitting enough to that expectation finally, the teacher downloads and that's done ! IMHO, we can also add a cumulative reviewing system such that who downloads a particulat project may also increase (in his/her view) or decrease the degree of fitness of that project into that expectation; this system should be carefully moderated by the committee, to prevent a mess of confusing scoring. Anyway it may be useful to get a realtime feedback by educators using scratch for math and related subjects. Your opinions are welcome. Thank you for your attention. PS: It would be a plus to add also a scoring system reserved for young users, as they are a very active partner of Scratch development."
401,math & physics resources,9/12/09 13:42,"Karen (R.), Roberto et al, I think the following link provides a good start for Strand ,Topic and Subtopic and this may be what we start with rather than the more details of the link that you shared from NCTM. These are basically th same but now have Topic and Subtopic also.  I have started extracting these and I will share but we need to see how we can divide the work of tagging projects with these. Karen (B.) can ScratchEd built something special for this purpose I hope we can discuss this in the workshop you may wish to run it by the team there. http://www.linkslearning.org/Teachers/1_Math/2_Curriculum_Planning/3_K-8_Math_Content/index.html"
401,math & physics resources,9/13/09 15:47,"I’ve a different point of view about the way Scratch can help the kids in the studying of school matters: it stimulates the pupil to make his own research about the subjects that he can work out with the Scratch. Then, first they need to learn how the Scratch works, in developing very much easy projects with a lot of handmade draws or NET imported ones. Afterwards, they need to see some, (only a few) projects well classified, (this is what your question is about), and I recommend to visit all the galleries of “DrSuper”, “Goch” and “Paddle2See”, to mention only three Scratchers that have collected properly some projects of the whole Scratch world.. Then, they must takeoff to their own fly, scratching the school matters with the support of their teachers and, in second line, the help of seniors Scratchers."
401,math & physics resources,9/13/09 15:58,"Hi Roberto, I’m afraid I must to give you back your question: tell me one concrete subject that   you would like to see transformed in a Scratch project to use in classroom and I’ll give you the project   by measure with all the aspects and changes that you consider as improvements. In conclusion: I think that you can require from a tailor a handmade suite that fits you instead of entering in a supermarket to search among the shelfs a suit that is the nearest of your needs."
401,math & physics resources,9/17/09 11:08,"Thanks for your comments, Fernando. My proposal is intended to teachers who have strict curriculum demands (e.g. from the Ministry of Education) and cannot spend as much time as they like to activities other than curriculum teaching. Every tool helping in doing this job is welcome. Your approach is good and i have been using it in my CS activities in after school centers since years ago, where curriculum demands are less compelling and the teacher/educator can decide what to do/not to do on his/her own. My 2 cents."
401,math & physics resources,9/30/09 3:46,"Hello, let me get into this discussion. A teacher of an afternoon course (7th & 8th grade) gave me some tasks she made for their students. She's very interested in using Scratch in combination with math and physics. I'll give you the first task: The capital is ""Programming with Scratch - Illustration and Calculation of Fields"" 1. Draw a (thin) line (AB) from point (A, coordinates specification) (horizontal) with a lenght of (5cm) - THIN is variable, it can also be THICK or DASHED - horizontal is variable, it can also be vertical or angle of 45 degrees That's only one task. Later on they have to do calculations on cuboids, prisms and other geometrical problems. The goal should be (teachers opinion) to teach the kids in easy programming AND math. The problem I figured out is that you can only demonstrate or visualize the problem in Scratch. I think it's hard to teach programming in Scratch AND boring tasks like the one I mentioned above. Either the kids learn to program OR learn and understand why they use appropriate formulas for geometric calculations. In the Scratch forums and gallaries are a lot of interesting visualizations of math problems. But do they explain the formulas working in the background? Isn't that what's important for math and physics? What do you think? Any suggestions to combine programming in Scartch and learning math? Thanks in advance Thilo P.S.: I think you can teach tasks like that in afternoon courses only, because teachers have strict curriculum demands (like roberto said)."
401,math & physics resources,9/30/09 7:33,"I am co-teaching a Physics + Programming + Math unClass this Fall. We had three two-hour weekly meetings so far. We have twelve homeschool kids, ages ten to sixteen, with varying levels of physics, math and programming backgrounds. Here are our tasks: Week 1 Physics: The scientific method. How many water drops fit on a penny? Hypothesis, observation, data collection. Programming: Make an applet in Scratch (very open-ended exploration, noisy happy group) Week 2 Physics: Variables. Pendilum experiments. Programming: Design a pendilum in Scratch (still open-ended, with a topic though) Week 3 Physics: Scientific communication. ""Silly robot"" games (describe making PB&J sandwich in words, with the ""robot"" doing everything possible wrong; describe your wooden block construction in words from beyond a screen and have a friend reproduce it) Programming: Make your pendilum take user input with multiple variables. ~*~*~*~*~* The gallery with a few of the projects is here: http://scratch.mit.edu/galleries/view/58724 ~*~*~*~*~* From Week 2 write-up: ""To recap, we saw examples of several major approaches to programming a pendulum, including direct animation (creating an instance of every event and then going through them in a slide show manner), repetitious code (turn, turn again, turn again), pseudo-random motion (one object following another, which is programmed to move in a certain way), infinite cycles (turn forever), and terminating cycles (""turn given number of times"" or ""turn until a certain angle is reached""). This is a nice example space to talk about programming methods - we started the discussion a tiny bit, but will continue more next week. Programming approaches parallel the ways people think about the world and make sense of it, but are mediated by one's programming and visualization/storytelling skills."" ~*~*~*~*~* From Week 3 write-up: This week, the modeling task was to have models take input from the user in the form of variables. Different people used different methods for input, mostly keyboard buttons and mouse clicks, but some experimented with on-screen buttons as well. The homework is to finish what you started, and to upload your applets into our gallery, which you can find at http://scratch.mit.edu/galleries/view/58724 Next week, we will start from looking at everybody's applets, making the master list of everybody's variables, and using it to discuss the idea of LAWS, from the math point of view statements about relationships among variables, in real and virtual worlds. For those of you interested in game design, laws create game mechanics http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_mechanics Please put a note of some sort on the screen of your model, explaining what input it takes (e.g. keys 1-6). These applets are open source, and many people will probably be using them. During the meeting, each author explained his or her model's input in words. I am very happy with the atmosphere of creativity and cooperation in the group. The models are getting more complex and involved. I can't wait to see everybody's variables. I bet we have a dozen or two different ones among us!"

Part 2: Play Time: As a group we decided to continue the conversations and explorations that people had already started. Janet and Mike worked on strategies for learning Scratch in order to teach it to HS students. Steve tried the 12 block challenge from the Scratch Day agenda and then worked on a maze with Michael and Ivan. They had a great discussion around ways to keep sprites from going through maze walls. Alina shared the ECS curriculum and some starter projects with Andrea and Jing.  Andrea’s sons built with the Little Bits blocks, inspiring Colin and Sandra to try out the Scratch Extension for Little Bits after a discussion on FabLabs. Andrea and Ingrid talked about the Creative Computing Curriculum Guide, the local chapter of the CSTA as a resource for getting involved with computer science education, as well as the Raspberry Pi and how it can be used in a variety of settings to help learn computer programming. Part 3: Lunch and Sharing: At lunch we were joined by representatives of the Kentucky Meetup team: Kelly, Brittany and Gayla. They came over from the MIT Scratch Day event to visit us. Then Andrea’s sons demonstrated the elaborate Little Bits chain they had built in two hours.  We were all impressed with how much they had learned since they had never seen the Little Bits before.  Janet shared CyberParra’s hunt game as an example of lists and Ivan suggested using the same strategy to make a Snake game.  Andrea’s 12 year old son shared his Scratch maze that he had made for a class project. Snif Snif, Hound will find you by CyberParra: https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/55222314/ Bee-Bot Simulator by Ivan: https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/61353618/ Our next meetup is scheduled for Saturday, June 6, 2015.  This will be our last meetup for this school year so please mark your calendar, sign up and join us at the Kennedy-Longfellow School in Cambridge."

6320,measuring impact of Scratch: what tools?,9/11/10 11:33,"OK, researchers, I am looking for your help in figuring out a way to assess how using Scratch affects the creativity and thinking of my students. I am teaching at a new school this year as a K-6 ""enrichment specialist."" The school's population is high-poverty (97%)-low-test-scoring and most of the day for students focuses on reading and math instruction.  I've been hired to combine science, art, and technology in a class that takes place during the regular teacher's prep time, rotating with 4 other prep teachers through the year.  I'll see some grades 14 times over the year, and others about 45 times.  The overall goal is to promote deeper thinking, creativity, and inquiry, and Scratch will be a big help! I would like to find a way to assess where the kids are now and see what impact the class has had at the end of the year.  I can make rubrics for Scratch projects or track changes in a few kids' approaches.  I am curious, though, whether there is any sort of measurement instrument or accepted practice out there that addresses overall problem solving or creativity.  Several of you have written about your research projects and I wonder whether you found a way to quantify data for a whole class or school of kids, one that would also be practical for a teacher to administer.  Obervational data would be hard to collect because I'm in the moment teaching. Suggestions are appreciated. Karen"

The assessment thing has dogged me for 3 years. There's no question that the kids benefit but how much and in what ways. If, say, the superintendent wanted me to justify my salarly with some hard numbers, I'd be caught flat footed. Without going into too much detail, there simply is no shorthand way to measure problem solving or creative thinking and get some nice, chartable numbers that show growth over time. Rubrics ARE a good though labor intensive way. There's a nice article worth reading with some positive research on the reliability and validity of a creativity rubric at http://www3.wooster.edu/teagle/docs/Balchin%20Assessing%20Students%20Creativity.pdf. It seems to me to have a possibility to look as some other, indirect measures that I don't have access to. You said that some kids you see 14 times and others 45 times. So you have groups of kids with well defined amounts of time with you. Well...you COULD look at attendance rates, discipline referals, overall grades, etc of these two different groups of kids and maybe make some valid points about the benefits of being with you more versus less. It wouldn't necessarily give you information about thinking and creativity skills but it could show patterns of positive reponses that indirectly show these skills."
6320,measuring impact of Scratch: what tools?,8/2/11 19:40,Hopefully soon I will have some form of measuring impact of scratch.  So far I have measured the affective impact of Scratch in Class ( which has been very positive and happy so far).  I am now looking also to measure the learning impact of scratch. I did try before in my honours project (my paper is in the resources section and there will be another paper soon) this was measured against standards in an ICT test given within the UK.  I am now focusing on the new curriculum in Scotland and how using Scratch to make games with children affects learning.

32228,Meeting quite a lot of problems :(,2/10/15 4:10,"Hi everyone, I'm new here even though I started using Scratch with my students (better said pupils) a bit more than a month ago. Thanks to the PDF cards, I managed to show them various ways of using Scratch, yet I have met a lot of annoying troubles and I doubt I am the only one. So here is a list of met troubles. I'm using Firefox 35xx under Windows 7 if anyone cares to know :) But when I made some attempts with Internet Explorer, I also met the same problems. - Clicking a sprite with the right button has no effect at all, no popping menu shows. - Unfortunately when this happens, the ""copy"" or ""delete"" buttons on top of screen do not react at all either. - When resizing a sprite, its moves seems a bit erratic as if the original size was still being used... As a consequence when going up and then right, for instance, the sprite seems to jump suddenly . - Sometimes the sprite goes off screen, while it (hopefully) still appears at the bottom of the screen. Yet I cannot bring it back on screen, all I can do is delete it with a right click. - Sometimes when I insert a second sprite, it won't move at all nor even appear on screen. - I still miss a button that would bring the sprite back to its initial position (also cancel moves, rotations and special effects all at once) That's quite enough for a start, I really hope someone can help me out since I'm wasting a lot of time trying to get things to work properly. Thank you for your help !"
32228,Meeting quite a lot of problems :(,2/11/15 15:05,"Hi Sébastien, I'm sorry to hear that you're having problems using Scratch. Here are a few tips for these two issues you mentioned: - Sometimes the sprite goes off screen, while it (hopefully) still appears at the bottom of the screen. Yet I cannot bring it back on screen, all I can do is delete it with a right click. - I still miss a button that would bring the sprite back to its initial position (also cancel moves, rotations and special effects all at once) You can click on the ""go to x:0 y:0"" and ""point in direction 90"" blocks in the Motion category, which will move your sprite to the center of the screen and point it towards the right. Under the Looks category, the ""clear graphic effects"" block will clear all special effects such as color. These are also useful blocks to use to reset your sprites at the beginning of your project. You can do this by placing these blocks directly under the ""When green flagged clicked"" block to initialize your sprites' positions and looks each time you start your project. Regarding the other problems you are encountering, I would suggest that you write to the MIT Scratch Team to let them know you are having issues. I'm not sure if it's a browser issue, but if there is a bug with the Scratch interface, but they might want to know or have more information on how to resolve it. You can contact them at help@scratch.mit.edu. I hope that helps! Sincerely, Michelle, on behalf of the ScratchEd Team"
32228,Meeting quite a lot of problems :(,2/12/15 2:58,"Hi Michelle, Thank you for your reply, any help is welcome :) Well maybe next time I should start with placing that ""reset"" button on screen so that the kids don't have to ask for me any help any moment :) As forthe other problems, I can hardly believe I am the only one encountering them. Besides the last time I contacted the Scratch Team it took them a week to get back to me. Honestly at the moment I will simply stop using Scratch as it takes too much of my time in preparation and I get so little help from anyone :( But I will get back to it soon or later :)"

I downloaded version 1.4 which is the latest version in French as far as I know but I'm wondering why the layout is so different from the online editor... The kids who tried it say they don't know how to find the commands we used at school. Last but not least, with respect to the translators, the commands don't bear the same names in the offline and online editors... It all makes things trickier."

55335,Merging different parts and levels of one game made by different users,5/1/18 15:09,"Just stopped by the ScatchEd site to grab the link to the Creative Computing Curriculum guide and spotted your question. The best solution I've found for this is to have students create a master game sprite where they drag all of their scripts, sprite costumes and backdrops into. Then this 1 sprite can be exported/imported to combine work of multiple students into 1 game. This doesn't work if each student is creating tons of content in their project, but works really well if parts of the game have been split between several students. To avoid confusion I would have them include their username (if not real name) in the master sprite name.

The children are surprised when I learn from them.  Sometimes I have discovered little parts of Scratch things that I didnt know through the children. On the other hand children get surprised when I say I will have to go away to find out what they have asked me and come back to them the following week with an answer to their problem. Amanda"

The application is available at http://wtp.mit.edu/application.html and the deadline is January 1, 2012. Their goal is to spark high school girls' interest in the future study of engineering and computer science. About the program Students attend WTP in either: Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) Mechanical Engineering (ME) WTP is designed for girls who have already demonstrated their ability to excel at math and science in their high school classes, but who have very little or no prior background in engineering or computer science. Female MIT graduate students design and teach the classes, assisted by female MIT undergraduate students who also live in the dorm with the high school girls. The daily required schedule includes classes, labs, homework, and social time with other WTP students. WTP classes do not earn academic credit from MIT; WTP students are expected to work hard because they are excited about learning. Sixty participants (40 for EECS and 20 for ME) are selected from a nationwide applicant pool of the top female 11 th grade math and science students. Students must reside in the U.S. (or be U.S. citizens if living outside the U.S. ). We are looking for students who are not yet certain about their future college majors, and who would like to explore engineering and computer science to determine whether these fields might be of interest. Who should apply Female students now in grade 11 who: love and excel at math and science, ?but have very little or no prior experience in engineering or computer science would like to experience hands-on activities where they design and build engineering projects enjoy problem solving and collaborative learning ? want to spend 4 summer weeks challenging their minds, working very hard in an intense academic environment, and making friends with girls from around the U.S. who share their math and science interests and motivation to excel.

I make my variables local by default, because I'm neurotic and like to limit the scope of things. But then, as I'm working, I realize I want to share the variable among my various sprites. The only thing I can do is delete the variable, and then make the variable again, but this time with the other scope. This is especially painful, because the old variable is still referenced in my scripts. I have to go and manually remove the old variable from my scripts and then replace it with the new variable of the same name."

42565,Modkit.io - A Scratch Inspired Text-based Language for adventuring outside of ScratchLand..,5/16/16 11:46,"Hi Scratch Educators! We're long-time Scratch proponents and collaborators (from the pre-release days) and have built a company (Modkit) around extending Scratch to additional platforms and activities including robotics and microcontrollers. We are getting ready to test Modkit.io, a new text-based programing language inspired by Scratch, with 1000 early adopters and wanted to get some Scratch educators in on the discussion and testing. As most of you know, Scratch is more than just about eliminating syntax errors with graphical blocks but is as much about the simple yet powerful programming model that it exposes.  Writing code local to a ""sprite"" with built-in multi-tasking (more than one thing can happen at once) and the event driven ""hat"" blocks that describe when each stack of blocks should run are very important concepts not available in most text-based (or even blocks-based) programming environments.  Many of us have learned this the hard way when venturing outside of ScratchLand with our eager students. We're looking to change that with text code that feels and works just like Scratch: We think this will be useful for educators that use Scratch as a stepping stone to traditional programming languages (as Scratch is taught in a number of University courses) or for students who have mastered Scratch and may be able to benefit from exploring beyond the safe sandbox. It can also be useful to expose kids to ""physical computing"" and Wiring/Arduino which is the target for our very first release of the language.  In no way do we see this as a replacement for Scratch or the thoughtful syntax-error free environment it provides.  This early release is actually best in the hands of an experienced educator who has knowledge of text-based programming and/or the Wiring/Arduino platform. In any case if you're interested, we're running a Kickstarter to gather support and get this out to early educators and users.  We have a limited number of seats to try the language for Wiring/Arduino for the minimum Kickstarter pledge of $1.  We hope to see many of you on our Kickstarter page so that we can keep Scratch educators in mind as we continue to develop this new and important language.  We think the lessons learned from Scratch are applicaple to everyone but we have a special place in our hearts for Scratchers! Best Reagrds, Ed Baafi Founder: Modkit"

2792,Mouse Double Click... Implementing,2/24/10 11:04,"Hi there, I am newbie in this site. I was looking in documentation of Scratch on how someone can handle the DoubleClick from the mouse. Unfortunately I did not find anything, so I decided to implement a new function - scenario. In the project there is my suggestion, in a simple project. The only sprite in scene, can accept single or double click from mouse and react accordingly. For those who want to play with the double click speed, can change the value in the “wait” block. If someone else has a better implementation, please lets he give it to me. Thanks NikoS"

12334,Music/Lyrics on so-called Scratch projects.,4/2/12 11:08,"When my students saw some of the really good music videos, such as http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/Wjc0906/670515 and http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/muffinninja/2054234, they were inspired, a few were inspired to create their own animated videos. Others were inspired to search out music on Scratch and found users like AustinMahonelover16 who has no projects, but has favored other's ""projects"" that consist of just a background and the music, most of which contains lyrics NSFS, (not suitable for school). I am not sure what the Scratch team can do, but I wasted a lot of time going around telling my students that the music they were listening to did not fit the district's AUP. I have been flagging them as I come upon such, but what a lot of junk that has nothing to do with programming."
12334,Music/Lyrics on so-called Scratch projects.,4/2/12 19:00,"Hi Carl, I feel a bit conflicted, as there are several tensions that play out with this. Certainly some songs that appear on the Scratch website are way over the line of appropriateness and are taken down. Other songs, which are somewhat risqué (particularly for a school setting), are significant parts of popular culture. This music is important to many young creators and inspires their creative work in all sorts of interesting ways. It's further complicated by the fact, as you point out, that some of these projects are very simple. For some Scratchers, this is a starting point -- a starting point that leads to amazing project development and wouldn't have been possible without those simple, humble beginnings. What seems like a lot of junk could be the first step along a creative pathway with programming. So, as you can imagine, we're disinclined to actively seek out simple projects and remove them, even though some people might not progress past these initial interactions. As it seems like you've already started to do, this is a great opportunity for conversations with your students -- about appropriate content, about what constitutes a substantive Scratch project, about how to build a productive and respectful learning community. That's a little about how I (and some of my colleagues) are thinking about it. I hope that helps... K"
12334,Music/Lyrics on so-called Scratch projects.,4/2/12 23:06,"I am a not really conflicted, most of the songs i have run into that would not fit our school's AUP I have flagged as inappropriate, these are users that have just a background and music - usually many many projects uploaded. One Scratch user is running a request line for posting songs through a Google form. Another asks for requests in their program notes. These are not rank beginners, (like member 984403), these other users are gaming Scratch to get and share music. Unfortunately, this will hurt Scratch in the end IMHO."

17376,NAMLE 2013 Conference,3/25/13 16:14,"The 2013 National Association for Media Literacy Education (NAMLE) Conference is taking place July 12-13 in Torrence, California. The conference theme is Intersections: Teaching and Learning Across Media. Here is an excerpt about the event from the conference website at http://namle.net/conference: Disruption is a watchword for the time we live in: competing social networking platforms, ever-shifting working styles, novel job descriptions displacing the old, manifold curricular and performance demands. With all these possibilities vying for our buy-in, it is vital to seek commonalities. It is at the intersections that we will begin to make sense and make use of a media revolution well underway and yet incompletely understood by our educational infrastructure. This conference will highlight the role of media literacy educators’ capacity to take a leading role in this nationwide task. Media-savvy educators now have the chance to articulate how new pedagogies can erect road signs at the intersections where communication practices, platforms, and cultures cross paths. Disciplines of thought and method can merge to form innovative perspectives, refreshing the way we approach problems and generating paths of study relevant to 21st Century careers, citizens, relationships and lifestyles. The 2013 NAMLE conference will reflect the reality that education is at a cross roads, with opportunities to push the boundaries in mixing old and new media, as well as combining no-, low-, and high-tech interactions that encourage society to share in the cultural production process of sense and meaning making."

I just learned Scratch (briefly) at NECC09, and I need to teach it to my students. They are in high school, but this will be there first exposure to programming of any type, so I think it'll be fun. Does anyone have a curriculum that I could follow to help the students learn it step by step, and not just ""make it work"", but learn some of the why's and terminology? Or suggestions for which projects I should teach/have them learn first, second, etc. All suggestions are welcome! THANKS!"
552,Need Curriculum Assistance ---quick!,8/22/09 20:24,"Hi Laurie, There's a lot out there that you might be interested in, but here's some of what I've tried: Scratch programming concepts - This handout documents some of the core computational concepts in Scratch. It's a bit abstract (in that it's not step-by-step), but it might help you think about how you want to help your students get started with Scratch. Design studio activities - This is a collection of design activities. Again, it's not step-by-step, but it might inspire different types of activities to try. Beyond the looking - This is a seven-part workshop that a colleague and I conducted over several months with a group of middle-school students. Although it's connected to a storytelling/empathy theme, each activity describes the blocks that are introduced, which might be of interest to you. Learn Scratch - I don't have experience with this set of resources, but I know others have used it and have liked it. It's a series of lesson plans and video tutorials for Scratch. There's more available -- both on ScratchEd and soon to be added. I look forward to hearing about what you try! Hope that helps, Karen"
552,Need Curriculum Assistance ---quick!,8/22/09 20:31,One more thing...I was reading Linda's post about how she gets started with Scratch and I realized that I forgot to mention the Scratch cards! I think the cards are a really great way to give students freedom to explore different code excerpts that they can then build up into interesting projects.
552,Need Curriculum Assistance ---quick!,8/23/09 9:48,"From my experience running several Scratch classes, kids really want to make computer games right away. So resources such as lists of game mechanics with popular game examples really help them brainstorm. What I mostly end up doing is letting kids work on their own ideas most of the time, since that's what they want to do, and then devoting 10-20 minutes out of every hour to showing them a connection of a couple of particular Scratch commands to game mechanics. Connection examples: Sensing - Touching color, with Motion - Go to x, y for the maze game mechanic (teleport to the start of the maze upon touching walls) Motion - Point toward sprite, with Motion - Move steps, for chase and resource collection game mechanics (think Pac Man) Looks - Change Effect, with Sounds, for win/lose notification mechanics As students develop projects, they can have an ongoing collection of these, similar to the format I started, but with examples of their own projects, either on a poster on the wall, or on the web. I taught a Scratch class this Spring with only six 75-minute meetings, and some students who never programmed before. I did no formal introduction of computer terms, and indeed very little (probably 20 minutes total) discussions overall, other than helping with particular project questions. However, at the end of the class I went through a basic vocabulary list from a Computer Science 101 class, such as ""conditional statement"" and ""infinite cycle"". Students were able to make examples for EVERY SINGLE TERM from their own projects and those of classmates. It felt like magic."
552,Need Curriculum Assistance ---quick!,8/25/09 11:23,"well, i went through the entire learnscratch.org tutorials and i think they're suitable to learn the language step-by-step, with a very gentle introduction to programming; my feeling is that the first two parts may be simply given directly to students since they are very simple, but if the kids are really young they may appear somehow long; by the way, i strongly appreciate the approach outlined in the first reply, since i think that it is more engaging to give young students free (yet assisted) time to explore the language and - then - cook down the CS concepts behind"
552,Need Curriculum Assistance ---quick!,8/29/09 11:43,"I agree with Roberto. I found the learnscratch.org tutorials to be very useful indeed. I start off with the really basics (movement). I use classroom management software to lock the learners input devices and blank their screens while I demonstrate some theory over the data projector. This is usually preceded by: “Imagine we were designing our very own game, where our hero had to walk around a house… blah, blah, blah”. I show them how it’s done, and emphasize that there could be other ways to do it. I unlock their computers and have them repeat what I showed them. So, I found the “LOOK & LISTEN, then DO” approach to work rather well. They get bored with this if you carry on too long, so be sure to follow with a mini project. My grade 6’s are now in the mid-stage of designing their own games in teams of 4. And I am absolutely amazed at some of their projects. No doubt, I’m the one with the knowhow BUT, they are the ones with the imagination."

34083,Need help please,5/4/15 8:18,"Hi hope all is well, I would like to share an idea with you, a concept that looks to change the education system worldwide; an idea in its early stages of development but so grand in its ambition that it seeks to eventuate global equality though education and the gift of knowledge. I write to you because as you are I'm a computer enginering working full time with education. I'm responsabile to evaluate and propose solutions with all sort of solutions that involves technology. I am interested in building a relationship with you so eventually we may work together with shared values, I like that you belief that the key to development of human resources lies in universal education and gender equality. When equipped with knowledge, skills and ambition, children can grow up to live happy, empowered lives, and be valuable members of their society. First I would like to introduce our concept: We are a non-profit organisation striving to empower the world’s poorest individuals through advancing educational opportunities. We work on the expansion of education by providing a new approach to the content and delivery of the learning experience, giving knowledge to the less privileged with no previous means of accessing the opportunities now available in the digital age. We are puttind a lesson plan together to use scratch on this platform on which the tools of learning will empower people with the technical language of the future, so we may globalise communication in the digital era. Connecting people in the remotest of places with a universal language will not only change lives through impact but change the meaning of equal opportunities. Our mission is to educate children in coding and design concepts by engaging them in cutting-edge technology, like Raspberry Pi, with inspiring projects that are fun and productive; Building games of their own designs with javascript, HTML CSS and python. We aim to make this learning model a part of the school curriculum to give children the chance in developing countries to work on a universally recognised skill, building their confidence in developing themselves and broadening their career prospects worldwide. We want to build lasting relationships with local communities and encourage everyone’s engagement in the program. An allocated teacher will be provided for the leading and supervision of the learning development of our students. Our continual support will see that individual learning needs are met and that graduates are given the tools they require to utilise their skills as they grow. Current education in technology development has discovered a huge weakness that has inhibited the ability to actually understand the concept of how it works. Graduates understand how to use technology but not how to build it; coding is the key in advancing both technology as we know it and the people using it. The ever growing needs of the employment market can be met by those with the skill set to take it one step further. This is what we offer. There is a significant difference between consuming information and being confident to develop it. Imagine speaking the same language; code, this could be the first step to creating global equality, in terms of opportunity. Regardless of where you are, we get you where you want to be. I request the opportunity to communicate directly with you so we can further discuss the processes that are under way with regards to both the business model and applied funding. I would also like to explore how we may potentiate a partnership. Kind Regards Ellen Bannerman ebspda@gmail.com"

Use ""File > Open"" (Scratch 1.4) or ""File > Upload from your computer"" (Scratch 2) to open a project file. The games are the files named .SB or .SB2 depending on which version of Scratch you're using. Scratch can't open the ZIP files, they need to be unzipped first. Hope that helps-- Tyler For Scratch 2 (the one on the Web): http://nostarch.com/download/Super-Scratch-2-Resources.zip For Scratch version 1.4: http://nostarch.com/download/Super-Scratch-Resources.zip Download those, unzip the game files.

3770,Negative Comments within the Scratch community,4/26/10 16:33,"Hi! I'm wondering whether any of the teachers here have had negative experiences with their students and the Scratch community and how they have handled it.  What happened to me on the surface doesn't seem that strong compared to what goes on elsewhere on the internet but it has dampened and tarnished Scratch at our school.  I am hoping that others might help me know how best to respond to the situation, since I am just a volunteer teacher and my experience at classroom teaching is limited. I was the one to set up teaching Scratch at my school.  I had each student in 2-5 set up a Scratch account using their first name only followed by the initial of our school.  I asked them not to post their photos and to mindful that things were somewhat public online.  It didn't occur to me that perhaps I should have gathered permission from parents ahead of time.  It didn't seem much different to me, in concern, than having the students access National Geographic and similar sites online.  There are only about fifty students in the entire school and the other teachers are not very involved with computers so, although they had heard me rave about Scratch, they probably did not think too much about it later and thought, I found out later, that I had more control of the situation than I actually could have. Overall, the students have been very enthusiastic about Scratch and some do it at home as well, which I basically thought was a good thing. However, for whatever reason, one of the older boys commented on a project of another Scratch student somewhere in the USA saying that their project was ""lame"".  I don't know whether he made this comment from home or while he was in my classroom.  The first I heard about it was when I found the teachers and students very upset that the student at the other school had, in return, posted a comment to my student's project containing mild profanities at the quality of my student's project. I was called on the carpet by the teachers that operate the school.  They couldn't believe that I would expose the students to something where they might receive comments like this.  They also couldn't believe that I would put the students in a situation where I wasn't reviewing each comment they received before they could read it.  I was told that the situation was completely unacceptable and that the parents would never tolerate it. We were on vacation break for a week and today I submitted a parent approval form for Scratch which I had put together, referring to the website and speaking of the benefits of the program, explaining how the community operated in a generally positive manner and asking their permission.  I gave the form to the head teacher and she said that she needed time to review it with the other teachers and I am to refrain from teaching Scratch until the other teachers come to a decision.  I'm not really a participating member of the teachers' group since I am just a volunteer teacher two mornings a week.  In the past, I think I have generally been on good terms with the regular teachers, so I will wait and hope that we will be able to continue using Scratch in some form. How have the rest of you handled situations like this?  I feel really terrible about doing anything negative towards the students, particularly on issues concerning safety and self-esteem.  My wife, who has much more teaching experience than me, though compared it like this.  What if my student on the playground had yelled out through the fence to some driver passing by that their driving was lame?  Then perhaps that driver might respond with a curse or similar.  In this case the driver would actually have seen the student.  Would the playground supervisor be responsible and in what way? Are there some materials on a Scratch site that might give me some guidance on issues with classroom safety and parents? Thanks."
3770,Negative Comments within the Scratch community,4/26/10 18:04,"Hi Bruce I believe the terms and conditions require a student to be 13 years old to have an account.  What I do with my students is upload their work to my own account.  This way I can also better monitor any comments made (though that is not perfect).  For the most part this cuts back on the negative commenting since it is posted on a teacher's account.  I do get permission from the parents before uploading their work to the website.  I also explain the age requirements for opening an account and that parents must be the responsible adult at home to monitor the account if they open one.  Finally I discuss with the students that there will always be a few ""malcontents"" out there who will make negative comments ""just because"" and they shouldn't take it personally. I have been an elementary school teacher for 32 years and find Scratch to be a wonderful program for my students.  It's unfortunate that the teachers in your school have reacted in such a negative way to this situation. Hang in there and try to win them over by showing them how much students gain.  Perhaps you might consider sharing my lesson plan on Animating Aesops Fables and my student's work  so they might see what the possibilities are for expanding their own teaching. I think it will be self-evident to any good teacher  and you won't have to do much convincing. http://scratch.mit.edu/galleries/view/37347 http://teachersnetwork.org/grantWinners/Teachnet09_NancyCosta.htm Best of luck, Nancy"
3770,Negative Comments within the Scratch community,4/26/10 19:06,"Hi Bruce, I'm sorry to hear about your experience with your students using the Scratch site! I think the Scratch site is full of great opportunities for sharing creations, meeting other creators, and learning more about Scratch -- but that's not to say there aren't any problems. As you point out in your message, some of those problems are part of life online. (And interactions with people more generally, thinking about your driver example!) In my experiences of talking to a wide variety of teachers about this subject, some teachers/schools are willing to tolerate some of the problems and treat them as opportunities to learn about interacting with others and self-representation online. Other teachers/schools say that problems cannot be tolerated -- and don't permit accessing the Scratch site from school. Of course, there are things to try other than the kids having their own accounts -- like you posting the projects through a central account, as Nancy suggests. (Just a clarification, it's fine for someone under 13 to have an account, but they need to provide a parent/guardian email address.) I hope you'll keep us updated about your thinking and what happens. If there's anything I can do, please let me know. Sincerely, K"
3770,Negative Comments within the Scratch community,4/26/10 19:29,"Thanks for your comments and suggestions. I'm thinking about what you said about the central account idea and wondering about some particulars.  Would you, then, during class have all the computers logged into the same central account?  I suppose the students wouldn't know the password to this account (or else they'd be able to use it unsupervised from home).  So would you then type in the password when they want to upload their work?  Or do they just save it on the local computers? I'm thinking in particular of several students I have that like to work on their projects from home.  Sometimes they turn up in class having made quite major enhancements to what they have done.  (One fifth grader even had one of his games selected for a ""best Scratch games"" gallery someone was putting together.) I'm feeling really mixed feelings about the whole thing.  Some students really love posting their projects and hope to get some comments or recognition (as they sometimes do).   It makes it feel very exciting and timely to them compared to just doing something for our small computer class. I will definitely look at those lesson plans thoroughly.  I like to see Scratch used as a media for learning in other subjects.  (Good examples of that would make for an interesting Scratch gallery or perhaps there already is one.) Bruce"

When their projects are completed, I save it to a thumbdrive and upload to the central account at home. (Our firewall doesn't permit us to upload to the Scratch site in school). I see your point about  their being able to work on it at home. There is a way to get around that as well.  They can work on it at home, save it to a thumbdrive and update it in class. I think all of these issues are easy to work out.  As the saying goes ""Where there is a will, there is a way!"" Nancy"

Also, do you have the feeling that they go and check the comments people have posted on their projects posted on the central account? What do you think students get out of the online community when using a central account?"
3770,Negative Comments within the Scratch community,4/27/10 19:02,"Hi Andres I do not give the students the password to the account. They do not post comments, create galleries, tag, etc.  They do check the comments people have posted on their projects and I  let them know when there are comments if they haven't checked.  I do think that as my students are only 10-11 years old, it is best that there be some limits on their participation with the online community. As their teacher, I am the responsible party after all. I think a little common sense goes a long way  to ensuring that their participation on the site is always safe and a positive experience. Nancy"
3770,Negative Comments within the Scratch community,5/2/10 9:51,"I also use a central account and suggest to kids that they make a personal one at home under parent supervision.  Posting to the school account comes with permission.  I didn't think much about the limiting  impact this has on communication about each other's projects until seeing the online chat that erupted in a different setting, when we made a wiki to share math concepts. For that, I gave each student their own log-in as a trial.  They quickly discovered the message feature, which I was monitoring.  Some mornings I came in to find 30 messages, mostly random  one-line kid chat but often enough about the math that it positively impacted the quality of the pages.  (Then, a couple kids realized they could use the wiki log-in from school to make their own wikis, unmonitored and public.  So, alas, I'm not sure if I'll do this the same way another time.) Anyway, the point is that in the restricted Scratch web environment I allow, I'm not seeing anywhere close to the same level of authentic kid commenting as for the wiki project.  That seems a shame, and worth addressing."
3770,Negative Comments within the Scratch community,5/2/10 21:54,"Nancy, I liked your Aesop Fables project quite a bit.  I may do that as a closing project with my 2nd-3rd grade and maybe 4th-5th as well (provided I get to continue with Scratch). --- Regarding the comments, accounts and Wiki discussion, I think it is either clever or a lucky accident that Scratch seems to only allow communication between users as part of project comments.  (Maybe there is another way, but I haven't found it.)   I think that helps to keep things on topic and also makes it relatively easy to cut down on flack by simply turning off project comments (or so it would seem)."

2383,New here. Scratch in 2nd-5th,1/22/10 11:32,"Hi! I'm new here. I'm teaching Scratch in computer classes to my 2nd-3rd grade class (8 students) and my 4th-5th grade class.  I started teaching Scratch about two weeks ago and I have to say that Scratch is the most exciting thing that I've ever taught.  The enthusiasm is amazing and I can't believe some of the projects that they have posted in such a short time. I don't have many specific requirements in curriculum from the school other than getting in some typing and newsletter writing somewhere, so I'm here to get whatever suggestions I can. Although I've taught a fair amount of private music lessons and done a bit of corporate education classes in technology, this sort of classroom teaching is new to me this school year.  I teach computers to K-5 two days a week.  My full time gig is as a smart phone developer with Nokia, who I see is mentioned as having a connection to Lifelong Kindergarten.

2383,New here. Scratch in 2nd-5th,1/22/10 19:33,Hi Bruce -- and welcome! It's wonderful to hear that the kids are so enthusiastic about creating with Scratch. Could you share a link to the projects they've been making? What approach(es) to introducing Scratch have you already been using?
2383,New here. Scratch in 2nd-5th,1/24/10 0:00,"Approaches?  They are pretty ""ad hoc"".  I realize there is guidance in some of the Scratch material.  I was introduced to Scratch mostly at a Media Lab open house when I worked for France Telecom/Orange Labs.  I had tried a small amount of Scratch with my son Noah at home when he was seven.  It was sort of an alternate activity to bedtime reading. But now, on sort of a volunteer basis, I am the computer teacher at Wayland Academy of Framingham ( http://waylandacademy.org ) and have also inherited care of the website, which needs help.  Since I work at several other jobs and have five older children as well, my time is really limited.  So each of the two days I teach in a week seems to come up suddenly.  I have three classes:  K-1 (10 students), 2-3 (8 students), 4-5 (6 students).  No one else at the school had heard of Scratch (except for one other student, it turned out), but they trust me a fair amount to create the computer curriculum as needed, so for 2010 I deceided to do Scratch perhaps about half the time with 2-3 and 4-5.  (K-1 seemed a bit young, but I figured they might later be an interesting audience for the other classes.) Each class is only 30 minutes, so I did: 1st class) Talk in general about Scratch and get everyone signed in.  (That's still not quite done due to some absentees, but I am straightening it out myself as needed.)  Considering the anonymity and my need to be able to easily work interactively with everyone, I had everyone use their real first name and ""Waof"" (for Wayland Academy of Framingham) for their last name.  Thus, I am ""Bruce Waof"". We all have different first names fortunately.  We all are set up initially with the same password.  I let them change certain details if they were still nervous about security.  Some wanted to live in Africa, but I thought that was a bit much. 2nd class)  I used my overhead projector.  (Just using that in the lab creates a bit of mystique fortunately.)  For the 2-3 class, I did Scratch myself for the whole session.  It was fun.  I pointed out the cat and the eight groups of commands on the left.  I took requests.  ""What should the cat do next?""  I did a lot in immediate mode.  Then I put things in a loop with the ""forever"" construct and soon the cat was bouncing off the walls and making noise.  We added a few more sprites.  I did some weird vocalization. We ended up with this (Hey): http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/BruceWaof/854937 With the 4-5 group, I did similar for the first 15 minutes and let them do their own stuff for the last 15 minutes because they were raring to go. In fact, some were trying to duplicate on their own computers what I was doing overhead though I had asked them to just watch. (Normally they are trying to play games or do other things, but this was very different.) At one point, I was showing the recording feature. This time, I asked them all to make a sound, but nothing that would upset the parents. Somewhere along the line, we had this (CrazyAnimals): http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/BruceWaof/857170 As you can see, they asked to play with images more. Then they were off doing their own things. A few finished a simple project that day and uploaded it. It was a very exhilarating day for me, as have been all the sessions so far with Scratch. It felt like one of the sessions in ""Glee"", if you have watched that show. It went so well, you almost wondered if it was choreographed. 3rd class) I had the students explore Scratch or do projects as they chose. Here are some of the projects that resulted: http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/AlexWaof/844717 (dictionary ball by Alex Waof) http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/Adamwaof/844730 (B, O and B by Adam Waof) http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/mahimawaof/844721 (dragon torture kitty by Mahima Waof) http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/JonnyWaof/844718 (running player by Jonny Waof) http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/TessWaof/857484 (Tess Project by Tess Waof) http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/Artemiswaof/844724 ( aaaahhhhcocococococ!!!!!!! By Artemis Waof) 4th class) I've had a fourth class with 2-3, in which I showed these demo projects I had made: http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/BruceWaof/854603 (Spinning Cat And Fish) http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/BruceWaof/854780 (CatAndButterfly) http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/BruceWaof/854782 (CatAndButterflyAndStar) http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/BruceWaof/854784 (Drawing Cat) I showed them how one could download someone else's project and do their own version by modifying this one from the 4-5 class using the 2-3 class's suggestions: http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/AlexWaof/845522 (costume changer by Alex Waof, a student) http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/BruceWaof/854881 (changing colors, my slightly modified version) I also showed them this one, which I had found from the 4-5 class. (It's a bit like the Flash game hit ""Red Ball 2"". It has four levels, obstacles, etc. I really didn't know what to say.): http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/AlexWaof/849618 (ball game by Alex Waof) Then we did more independent exploration, but 4-5 was scheduled for a field trip. However, one of the 4-5 graders asked if he could meet with me at 9am to talk about Scratch before he went on the field trip. Unfortunately, that is right in the middle of my K-1 class. And that's the story up to now.  Not too much detail, I hope.  I'd like to hear more of the experience of others in the classroom. Where I teach is a pretty neat school to begin with, but it has still been a surprise to see how the students have taken to Scratch so far. Bruce"

1256,New Scratch Tutorial Needs Your Feedback,10/25/09 14:10,"I like the way you were able to zoom in and out and the spyglass effect to focus attention on the mouse movements. Some students might benefit from a visual label of each step.  The preview was too fast for me to follow and would definitely be a confusing blur to students unfamiliar with Scratch.  Perhaps replacing the preview with a bulletted list of the steps could solve both of these issues.   Taken out of context,  I'm not sure what you mean when you say  ""In Rainbow Fish you will. . ."" The tutorial never reffers to ""Rainbow Fish,"" after first line, so I'm left with an unresolved expectation. I'm guessing that you are tageting a very young audience with this tutorial.  Perhaps 2nd or 3rd grade students? I  think a more conversational ""think-aloud"" style might be helpful.  Something like, ""I'm creating a game that happens underwater, so I want to get rid of the cat. First I'll delete the Scratch cat by. . . ""  or, ""I want to make the fish change color with my keyboard so here's what I'll do. . ."" I think it would be helpful if you demonstrated what the number box in the block does. I was overstimulated by the audio in this tutorial.  To me, the sound effects in the SFX version were mildly distracting rather than helfpul.  The music track was very distracting to me.  The narration is very clear, but my 9 and 11 year old daughters both commented that the enthusiasm in your voice sounded a bit forced.  My 11 year old would also commented that the ""change effect"" block changes the appearance of the sprite but does not actually change its color (wich according to her would be done by repainting its costume).   I"

However, it is Windows 7 only (MS restriction, not mine). I was interviewed about Scratch & Kinect last week, here is the writeup and video: http://newtechpost.com/2011/07/11/stephen-howell-using-scratch-with-kinect-for-education I said there was a need for more Scratch evangelism! I am looking for beta testers, so if you have a USB Kinect and Windows 7, please reply and I'll send you everything. My site is here: http://scratch.saorog.com with contact details. Update:  I am rather excited (and delighted) to be presenting a talk and workshop at the awesome Art && Code conference in Carnegie Mellon University October 21st – 23rd in Pittsburgh. My workshop will be on Scratch and Kinect hacking. Hope to see you there. 2C: Teaching Kids Programming with Scratch & Kinect Regards, Stephen Howell (Computer Science Lecturer, Institute of Technology Tallaght, Ireland)"
10136,New Version of Scratch & Kinect,10/8/11 10:56,"Hi all, A new version of my software which lets you program for the XBox Kinect with Scratch is now freely available on http://scratch.saorog.com You will also find some instructions and new sample Scratch files there as well. This version is based on the MS Kinect Software Development Kit (SDK) so you must have a USB Kinect and Windows 7 to use the software. I hope some of you can use the software and have fun with the Kinect. Regards, Stephen"

54278,"New Year, New Classes",1/24/18 18:16,"I am starting the new year in Australia with new classes (but same students) so I need to end my current classes and place students into new classes. I don't, however, want to close any of the student accounts and I don't want the students to lose any of their work of which they are so proud. Can someone advise how best to do this?  From what I understand if I close the current classes, the students lose their work.....  Any teachers out there able to help me with this??"
54278,"New Year, New Classes",2/9/18 11:51,"Hi Rebecca! This is a great question, and quite a tricky one! If you close a current class, the studio itself will still be visible on Scratch, but the students will no longer be able to log into their previous accounts. When students make new accounts for the new classroom, it is possible for them to then remix their old projects and save them onto their new class studio, it will just take some time to 'transfer' the files from the old studio into the new one. Here is the info from the teacher FAQ, if you haven't seen it: What happens when I ""end"" my class? When you end a class, your class profile page will be hidden and your students will no longer be able to log in (but their projects and the class studios will still be visible on the site). You may re-open the class at any time. I'd also recommend hopping onto the Teaching with Scratch Facebook group, an extension of the ScratchEd discussion boards, to gather insight from more educators about the topic. I hope this is helpful! Best, Alexa"

13757,Notes from Final Reflections,8/11/12 18:34,"Brief notes from our ""circle share."" -encourages inclusion -links to art-we can totally use art, design, on compupters -took us from where we were and moved us forward -the tour of the media lab-hi-lo tech gave us a broad scope for our kids' futures -Scratch on the Web-got to see ""under the hood."" Something for everyone. MIT provides the vehicle but we make it come alive. Learning is social-these workshops are so important for learning! Teacher Development idea: have teachers and students work together to learn Scratch. Both come away with different concepts and knowledge and can help each other. Social Studies idea: have Washington crossing the Delaware. ""Blended Deliveries""-tech and teaching. Adults shut down...""I don't do tech."" But, Scratch is easy and fun! Tools-harpsichord, pens.... Scratch is not a resource hog, so nice to use in labs. Since PPT is becoming passe, Scratch might be a viable presentation tool. Walking into a painting... The Creative Process Some kids are not grade-motivated. We still need to tap into their interests. Need tools and framework in which to work. Freedom without anarchy! Advisory: put the kids and teachers in learning teams. Intrinsic motivation. Do activity with teachers first and then with kids if nervous! Teachers don't know everything! Let kids know that! Tech teacher teaches all teachers how to use Scratch, then let kids work and learn and use computers in all curricula areas! Teach mini-lessons and as other kids see others working on Scratch they might ""catch"" it! 2.0 Logo maybe make one that appeals to older kids? -You don't screw around with Coke Classic!- mres: might set up ways to choose a default character for classes Looking into other image libraries, says that the characters do appeal to younger kids. Would love posters Would love  more time in Media Lab-insanely amazing place! Wide variety of people here, some needed prerequisites, prep for newbies. Would love a path to suggestions as to what to learn/do first, then next...What resources do I begin with? Identify this at the beginning. Work on Scratch cards in order. No one path for everyone but doesn't mean we shouldn't have a path for anyone! Want next set of cards! :) Can't export Scratch projects. Could use Jing or other similar software.

12671,odd development with group work...,5/8/12 8:27,"An interesting problem is developing in my class and I'm just wondering if anyone might have some ideas. As the students (high school) are getting better with Scratch, their programming problems are getting more complex but not the creativity of the projects. The class is becoming fragmented as fewer and fewer can help with the programming problems. Those who are natural programmers are getting impatient when they are not able to solve more advanced problems and those who are not, finding the problems too complex to follow, are dropping out of what was a very collaborative environment earlier! Any thoughts or ideas????"
12671,odd development with group work...,5/9/12 7:27,"Perhaps you could introduce some collaborative scaffolding? Like, build in explicit opportunities for your students to talk with each other and give each other feedback?"
12671,odd development with group work...,5/9/12 8:03,"Yes, the opportunities to talk need to not be abandoned! I can't believe how easy it is to give in to the ""we just want time to work and learn and not keep talking"" line from students!  I've been so happy that everyone is so engaged with Scratch that sometimes it seems even odd to me to take away from a chunk of experimenting time to sit and talk together. Yet of course there's more to it than just that... I think we need to keep articulating the importance of when you work and when you talk and the relationship - especially with ""computer"" courses and with large classes in school. Maybe this is less of an issue for afterschool programs. We're at the point of making games. We are launching this ""unit"" - although I have a feeling it will be the rest of the year... by visiting the collection at the Museum of the Moving Image and in fact our tour will have an emphasis on the history of the moving image and early video games. When we return, I plan to do some game theory. One activity is a box filled with odd objects and groups make ""games."" I'm hoping this will help bring us back to our good sharing environment. It seems natural that Scratch would lead to more complex programming issues. I'd like to also know how other teachers keep the interative thinking going with more advanced users. I don't think we're at a point where Scratch will no longer meet our needs so how have others done troubleshooting when a few students are really stuck? I've directed some to the open Scratch community but it's too late in the game for them to have patience for looking how to find help. I'm thinking that next year, the use of the community needs to have a much greater place in the curriculum from the start. What have you found?"

33541,one day crash course method for 8th graders.,4/7/15 13:02,Hello everyone! I am a teacher in training and volunteer to help at a middle school montessori math class. The math teacher who I help gave me  a day (one fifty minute class) to introduce scratch to his students. I really want them to make some small program that they think is neat and is show-offable to the class near the end of the period. The goal is to get them interested in programming. None of them have any programming experience nor have they ever heard of scratch before. However I don't want to spend fifty minutes walking them through all of the cool things they can do with scratch because I want them to use the majority of the time discovering/creating their own thing. Ideally I'd like to give the class a 5 to 10 minute introduction to the interface of scratch and then let them have at it.  Does anyone have any suggestions on what I should go over in that 5 to 10 minute intro in order to maximize both what they can do and the time they have to work with? Please help me!

When introducing Scratch for the first time, I intentionally avoid the traditional overview approach, which can drain precious minutes.  Instead, I lead students through creating their accounts (or opening the offline version, which does not require logging in), then introduce the objective(s) for the starter project, showing a finished version, then perhaps doing the first step or two on the projector/smart board, before setting them loose."

39044,Performance indicators and outcomes for scratch programs,12/18/15 11:43,"The organization I work for (the Urban League of Essex County) was awarded a small grant to run a demonstration program designed to introduce 30 students ages 10 -13 to the fundamentals of Scratch. The program deigned was relatively simple (students met every Saturday from 9am - 4pm), and were taught by a fourth-year college student majoring in Compute Science. The instructor was assisted by 6 Technology Mentors (also Computer Science majors). The program started on October 3, 2015, and will be ending on December 19, 2015. The program has been so successful that my organization has been invited to apply for a much larger grant. However, this grant application is asking for specific performance indicators and outcomes for the program. Has anyone had experience mapping the performance indicators and outcomes to the creative curriculum, or any other curriculum for that matter. My email address is: dsharif@ulec.org. Thank you. P.S.: Our grant proposal is due today, 5pm EST. They did say this is the season for miracles, didn’t they?"
1582,Perimeter,11/16/09 15:34,"As part of one of my math classes we are learning about scratch.  I was asked to write a scratch procedure that would allow me to produe a regular polygons that have a fixed perimeter of ""420 sprite steps."" I was wondering if anyone can help me get started on this. Thank you in advance  for any help you can give!"
1582,Perimeter,11/17/09 11:38,"If you know the perimeter (420) and the number of sides (taken as input), then you can calculate the length of each side and the interior angle (http://www.coolmath.com/lesson-interior-angles-of-polygons-1.htm), which is all you need to draw the polygon. Does that help?"
1582,Perimeter,11/17/09 15:23,A little. I guess I just don't understand how you can set your perimeter where it has to be 420 and will not change on scratch. If that makes any sense!
1582,Perimeter,11/17/09 23:02,"In my program, I used variables. I created a variable called perimeter and set it to 420. I then used an ask block to get the number of sides from the user, so that the answer block stores the number of sides. Using that and perimeter, I can figure out the length of each side. (E.g. if the perimeter is 420, a triangle will have sides of length 420/3=140 and a square will have sides of length 420/4=105). Using the number of sides (in the answer block), I can determine the interior angle (the link from my earlier post). Next, I draw the polygon using pen down, repeat, turn, and move blocks. Does that make more sense?"

Is it possible to hook up a Picoboard AND a Wedo kit to the same computer/Scratch program and get the motor to react to changes detected by the Picoboards light sensor for example? Would really like to know before ordering. Thanks! IrisSophia
8032,Picoboard and Wedo with Scratch,11/9/10 13:00,"Hi Yes. I tried it now. And it works, but you could only use two of the inputs/output from the WeDo. It´s not possible to get all three working (tilt-, distance-sensors and motor). I haven´t tried to plug in two WeDo usb-units though. But you could use the picoboard lightsensor to control the WeDo-motor. My board is an older USB-Serial Scratchboard, but it should work with the USB Picoboard. Win XP... haven´t tried with Mac or Win 7. (Win Vista is a total disaster so I don´t even get near a Vista computer... ;)) /Anders The first snowy day today...."

Vista.LOL Lots of chuckles from  that salesman :))) Since the Picoboard works on them and on my Win 7 laptop, I'll cross my fingers.  I was even considering  Mesh which allows computers on a local network to view each other's variables and see broadcasts.Theoretically, if you place sensor inputs in variables all computers could see them and one ""Master"" computer could control motors on other computers based on inputs from a Picoboard or whatever.

By the way mercury... not a primary/secondary school...? ;) And I am willing to trade our 10-15 cm snow - 5 C Swedish weather with a 15+ C Portugese weather... :) And today I tried to connect two WeDo-usbhubs to Scratch.

Best, Claudia"
8032,Picoboard and Wedo with Scratch,11/22/10 6:29,"Replies to Claudia and Anders: I'm glad to have found this forum. Although Scratch isn't new here I don't know  anyone who has worked with the Picoboard or external Sensors.I love Math and know a bit about programming . Claudia , thanks for your answer! From below you can see I had already seen your name somewhere!I am very sad to say my laptop was stolen last year but its still all in my head and will be happy, if you're interested and given time to share code examples. Anyway I hope to redo some projects this year as well as try new ones. Wow,the idea you shared has everything to do with my views on the use of Scratch and I actually did that last year except for the humidity sensor! We saved data ( for example pairs of numbers  , time and temperature )in lists , exported as text,  then opened with Excel and did all kinds of graphs. Found out about Scratch before it was actually introduced in my country, loved it, tried  to learn as much as I could when I could ( time's always scarce...) and am still doing so. Portugal actually has its own Scratch site  only very  recently updated with Scratch 1.4. There is a very comendable organization of teachers here around Scratch.However, although Scratch is great for story telling and getting little kids to learn basic programming skills , here I haven't really seen its use advised for older kids. It has been mostly ""promoted"" for use in Math with 5th and 6th graders and before I prove them wrong some of my pupils say its "" kiddy stuff"",which is a pity when you can also create  interesting programs using more advanced concepts  with grades 7 all the  way up to 12 ( get kids to create ""missing operators"" with exponential and logarithmic functions...) Hope to hear from you Claudia! Here are  some ideas I used : Turned a bycycle upside down, taped a magnetic sensor to one part of the bike and  a little magnet to the wheel.The idea was to get the wheel to spin for a bit and calculate things  like:distance ""travelled"", speed and rotations per minute. Got the idea from the gadget on my husband's mountain bike. With the Temperature sensor got it close to really hot  or cold things and with pre-recorded kids' voices you could hear "" It's soooo hot"" or ""It's sooo cold."" I had thought of a "" talking"" plant who would complain if its soil was too dry but didn't find a humidity sensor in Portugal ( resistive humidity sensor) . I'm going to order from Rhopoint but it's going to really cost me because of shipping. Do you know if can use this sensor to measure soil humidity as well as  air humidity? Another hare brained idea I didn't get to try was a doll with a humidity sensor on an adapted diaper. She would cry out ""Change me"" when water you put in her mouth trickled down to the diaper... With four mercury switches taped to a plate which was then covered with transparent hard case with holes as a precaution and we simulated a steering wheel which controlled a car on the screen. We were very, very careful but the Wedo tilt sensor is of course the way to go. We also filled the screen with flowers of various colours and with the light sensor placed on the screen there was this little bumble bee which flew to where the sensor was.There was only one flower of each colour and at any given time the Scratch program knew exactly what flower the light sensor was on. Anders, thanks for the info. I haven't tried Mesh but it seems to be the only way to control more than one Wedo kit. Of course you'd need more than one computer but with shared variables and broadcasts there are a lot of possibilities...Regarding  resistance, for example I used Temperature Sensor 10 K OHM, Light Sensor 5K to 20 H OHM. Electronics isn't my specialty but after finding the following info I ordered a Picoboard and later on managed to get the external sensors in Portugal except the humidity sensor. Hope  the following info answers some of your questions. Sorry for enormous post.Please excuse any errors! Very best regards, Ana Santos From Sensor Types and Sources: I knew your name was familiar Claudia! The following list shows different types of sensors that have been used in Scratch Sensor Board projects.

Humidity; Consists of a metal electrode on a humidity sensitive membrane mounted on a ceramic substrate; http://www.rhopointcomponents.com  SYH-1NC. Thanks to Claudia Urrea for the initial list. Note: When using resistive sensors with the XO microphone port, it appears that the interesting resistance range goes from around 2k to 5k. (Experimentally determined; your mileage may vary.) From http://scratch.mit.edu/forums/viewtopic.php?id=6403: 17. How do the sensors convert their input to values between 0-100? From the Technical Info document: ""Scratch maps the 10-bit sensor data onto a 0 – 100 scale using a mapping that is different for each sensor type. Users can access the “raw  10-bit values by shift-clicking on the Scratch Board Watcher and selecting “report raw data . Doing so will show sensor values in the range 0 - 1023. Most of the sensors use a generic linear conversion to report scaled values between 0 - 100. Light and sound sensors use piecewise linear functions that take into account the idiosyncrasies of those sensors. (Note that readings for light are reversed so that more light gives larger values.) Code for scaling functions [are]: Code: generic(n) return round ((100 * n) / 1023) light(n) if n < 25 return 100 - n else return round((1023 - n) * (75 / 998)) sound(n) //empirically tested noise sensor floor n = max(0, n - 18) if (n < 50) return n / 2 //noise ceiling return 25 + min(75, round((n - 50) * (75 / 580)) ) //noise floor and ceiling values might vary 18. Um. OK. But in reality, how do the resistance values relate to the sensor value? Is it linear? Nope. It's not linear. It's logarithmic. From experiments on our board, the resistance sensor value (0-100) that the PicoBoard produces is related to the actual resistance, R, (in KOhms) across the alligator clips by the something like the following equation: sensor value = a*ln(b*R+1) where, approximately: a=19.5 b=0.9 BUT, if you are only interested in low resistance values between 0-10 KOhm, the following simple relation works real well (and yep, it's linear): sensor value = a*x, where a is approximately 5.57"

Also- I have been developing a scratch project to teach about Arduino. It's definitely not nearly done, but the idea is there. I have been poking around a little and was unable to find anything like this on the site. I would love to share it with people in the hopes that they will take it, make it better, use it for their own classes, whatever.

8032,Picoboard and Wedo with Scratch,1/20/11 13:11,"Hi Lindsay Yes it´s interesting with the arduinoboard. If I use a photoresistor with Picoboard it´s easy to get started and understand what is happening (I will soon try the picoboard with kids aged 11-13, a small techproject). But the Picoboard is too expensive (escpecially if you live in Sweden and order 10 boards, I had to pay somekind of importtax nearly 100 §, puh :(....). So the arduinoboard would be perfect. But it´s not so easy to get going for kids. There is a little bit higher learningcurve before you are up and creating. I would be nice if you share your arduino-experiences with us. The S4A - scratchclone is interesting http://seaside.citilab.eu/scratch/arduino And the ModKit will be really promising...

22880,Platform Game Help,10/4/13 13:17,"A student of mine has ledges continually moving from one side of the screen to another. When the Monkey walks off of a high platform and floats downwards she wants it to hit the red ledge, stick to it and move with it back and forth and then be able to walk off of the ledge by using the cursor keys. Can anyone help?"

22880,Platform Game Help,10/5/13 21:01,"First off, you can change the monkey's ""if touching ledge"" from ""change y by 0"" to ""set y to"" a set value (i.e. while standing on a platform y should not change)--I found a y of 80 worked well, keeping the monkey touching the green ledge. But the student also needs a way to tell the monkey the direction the platform is moving in so the monkey can move along the X axis with the platform.  One way is to use ""set x to"" in the same if/then block, but instead of using a numerical value for x you want to use the x position of Green Ledge--fortunately there's a block in the SENSING group of blocks which ""senses"" the value of various parameters for each sprite in a project. [I remixed the orginal project and made these 2 code changes here: http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/12981133/] Depending on the student's learning style, it might be a good idea to just give them one of the above solutions, perhaps just the Y fix, then see if they can figure out how to adjust X on their own.  Then they can transfer those solutions to the other platform(s). Once mastered, you could challenge them to set a hotspot for the feet so the feet must touch the top of the platform for the monkey to land on it.  And/or a platform that hits a monkey in the chest might send them tumbling rather than pulling them up/onto it.  For an older student add a bit of physics in the form of acceleration as they are falling."
22880,Platform Game Help,10/5/13 21:05,"Also helps to increase the speed of falling, perhaps ""change y by -5,"" otherwise it's hard to get past the green platform once you've landed on it."

The congenial atmosphere that surrounds the conference does not just happen.  We are together because we share a vision of learning and sharing that fosters big dreams in each of us. Each time I enter the Media Lab, my thoughts return to a night in the early 80s.  I was working on a Masters Degree at the University of Massachusetts in Amherst, focusing on instructional applications of computers. One of my professors, Claus Schultz, drove a group of us to MIT to hear Seymour Papert speak.  We arrived a little late; the room was filled to capacity. (Mitch, I think I remember you being there, working with him in a way that reminds me of the way I see you and Karen working together.)

15494,problem with mixed up users!,12/19/12 15:23,"Ah - so we've since learned more info. Most people who experience this kind of problem are using a plugin called ""HTTPS Everywhere"" , which has a bug that lumped our site in with all others at MIT, and made browsers assume we support a common web protocol called ""HTTPS"" - which we emphatically do not. We've since contacted them and were told they'd resolve the problem in the next release. It would be good to pass this on to the folks you are working with in case it's helpful to them. Also - the entire Scratch website is being rebuilt, and once we release the new version, it's quite possible this problem may go away. So you migth just want to wait until then (early 2013 - still no firm date though.)"

For some reason, his account only works on a single computer, which at the moment is not working.  It's very strange. I tried clearing all browser data, but that didn't seem to work either. Any ideas of what to do?  The student is 1/2 way through a project, so creating a new account isn't really an option.  And he hasn't shared it yet, so I can't access it to download as an .sb2 file.

Also, how does Scratch respond to this issue? Without having an account the students will miss out on the ability to remix and request comments on their projects.

48372,Project Tags,3/28/17 7:09,"Hi Elizabeth, My name is Christan, I work on the MIT Scratch Team. We have a set of suggested tags (seen in the image below). These tags include: Animations, Art, Games, Music, Simulations, Stories. These are some of the most used tags on Scratch. While we offer these suggestions, you should feel free to use any tag you would like! For example, if you are making a project about dogs, you shouldn't feel limited by the options we provide, use a tag that makes the most sense for you and your project (in this example I would use the tag ""dogs""). You can include up to three tags. (No spaces are allowed within a tag, so if you want a tag with multiple words simply remove the spaces - for example, Scratch Cat would become ""ScratchCat""). Something else to note is that the search engine also takes into account the title of your project as well as what is written in the Instructions and Notes and Credits so the more detail you provide in these areas, the better the search results will be. I hope this helps! Christan"

We have now started to look at scratch programs from a software engineering point of view trying to see if it is possible to define quality metrics for scratch programs. See http://artentnu.wordpress.com/2010/12/17/how-can-we-assess-the-quality-of-scratch-projects/ At this stage I wonder if there exist a possibility, given a scratch program, to generate statistics about its code (like number of control statements, number of variables, number of sound pieces, etc.). I also wonder if there are related attempts to define the quality of scratch programs. I am aware that quality is a relative attribute that must be defined according to a goal, but given 1.5 M scratch programs available it would be great if we had a way to select the best ones for teaching purposes, the best for visual aestetics, etc. Regards, Ivete"

9514,Question regarding lists,7/13/12 14:31,"The practicle answer is that longer lists create longer wait times when opening or saving a Scratch project. How long do you or others want to wait? Usually, not very long at all. Here is a link to one of my projects that uses several large lists. Download it, then open it in Scratch to see what I mean about slow loading. I split the data into several big lists instead of one huge list to make it easier to deal with whenm coding."
9514,Question regarding lists,7/14/12 4:54,Never used squeak but imagine its memory management is similar to other languages in which case your limit is the memory limits of the machine. Modern machines have gigabytes of memory and 8300 numbers would only be kilobytes of space. The reason the memory allocation isn't increasing is becasue the memory manager would allocate blocks of memory. If you carried going you'd evenually see the memory usage increase but in large increments.

I was pleased to see that the projects I created during some of the sessions at the Scratch@MIT conference were still there! It seems such a long time ago now, but looking at the projects helped remind me about the new features. (As well as bringing back great memories!) Now, where's that webcam...?"
14768,Questions and Suggestions for the Scratch 2.0 Alpha,11/3/12 12:11,"Thanks for sharing this test link! I just created a test project ""Blumenwiese"" testing parameterized custom blocks. It worked!! Small things: - in IE, the ""see inside"" button doesn't work (when I click on a project thumbnail, I get to the project page, but then I can't get to the scripts). So I used Chrome, and that worked. - I was looking for a save button for some time until I realized that there is some autosave going on, and occasionally, I see ""projects needs saving"". Same with notes/credits. Fine with me, but it takes some getting used to. - when I clicked on Make block for the very first time, no define-block template appeared and I was stuck. Only when I accidentally clicked on costumes and then on scripts again, the template suddenly appeared. From then on, it always appeared after making a block. - when the project was ready, I clicked on share, but on the project page it still said ""not shared"" over the stage. Only when I got to the page next time through my stuff, it appeared as shared. - the button for ""my stuff"" is tiny, and I didn't recognize it as the ""my stuff"" button. I found it by try and error (tooltip would help). - when I changed the language from English to German, a custom block parameter named ""color"" was autotranslated to ""Farbe"". This kind of localization is a bit too much, I think. Also, when I changed back to English, the parameter itself went back to ""color"" but its use in the custom block definition remained ""Farbe"". That's it for now - I'll keep testing! Bernd."
14768,Questions and Suggestions for the Scratch 2.0 Alpha,11/3/12 13:48,"Yes I was Scratching, pardon the pun, my head last night for a while as I couldn't get back to the editor using IE 9 as ""See inside"" doesn't work. Chrome also has problems as  ""See Inside""doesn't work occasionally on that. It makes the whole process really hard to get into a project and edit it. ""Create"" confusingly for me just dumps you into presentation mode with the Scratch cat and a large green flag but not the editor."
14768,Questions and Suggestions for the Scratch 2.0 Alpha,11/3/12 15:13,"OK, I still don't understand how saving/editing works. I have this shared test project, and now I update it by deleting one script. I see ""Save needed"" but don't click on it. After some more clicking in the interface, I see ""Saved at 19:47:52"", and clicking on the green flag indeed shows the effect of the update. But when I click on ""my stuff"" and from there go back to the project, I'm still seeing the old version before the update. Which is good, since I don't want autosave to mess with my shared stuff. But how do I now share the update? And how do I store intermediate changes during the update process, for example when I need to logoff and want to continue later?"
14768,Questions and Suggestions for the Scratch 2.0 Alpha,11/4/12 8:06,"I'm enjoying trying out Scratch 2.0! Here are a few things I've noticed: The clone blocks are very useful - I can really see people making great use of these. I like the higher resolution of the graphics. The backpack is incredibly useful for sharing sprites bewteen projects. This used to be a laborious process before. I can see this being very useful in a classroom situation. The saving process is not obvious at the start. There is obviously some autosaving going on, but there is no prominent save button. Perhaps it's a bit old fashioned but I like the old style disc icon to click when I've got something to work after a while. It sort of marks the end of that bit of the project and, after clicking, I know I can move onto the next bit, secure that my work is saved! I also noticed (See Mark Willis post) that the Create button takes me straight to the full screen presentation mode. However, if I go to one of my projects and then click See Inside it works fine. Then I can click on New and I get the proper editor view with all the blocks etc. (This was using the up to date Google Chrome) I'll keep testing!"
14768,Questions and Suggestions for the Scratch 2.0 Alpha,11/4/12 12:10,"I tested recursion with custom blocks (Fibonacci numbers) - it works! The only unfortunate thing is that there are no custom reporters which makes the code a bit cumbersome. Also, have comments diappeared? I can't find them anywhere, and loading a Scratch 1.4 project from disk renders them as a red (obsolete?) blocks. I'll keep testing! Bernd."
14768,Questions and Suggestions for the Scratch 2.0 Alpha,11/4/12 16:24,"I noticed that the German translations of blocks and their categories are incomplete. For blocks / categories that have been present in Scratch 1.4, one should simply choose the old German names. For new blocks and categories, I don't know whether names have been discussed / decided yet. Here's the natural proposal for some of them: - Data -> Daten - More Blocks -> Mehr Blöcke - Events -> Ereignisse - create clone of ... -> erzeuge Klon von ... - delete this clone  ->  lösche diesen Klon - clone startup -> Klon-Aktivierung - stop all / this script / other scripts in sprite - > stoppe alles / dieses Skript / andere Skripte dieses Objekts I'm happy to help with translations of others, if needed. While going through all this, I noticed that the actual blocks shown in the alpha differ from what the ""How Do I Use the New Blocks?"" section says. Most notably, the backdrop capabilities seem more rstricted than what the scene blocks advertise (for example, there's no ...and wait feature). Are the alpha blocks supposed to be the Scratch 2.0 blocks, or are there still changes to be expected? Thanks and all the best, Bernd."
14768,Questions and Suggestions for the Scratch 2.0 Alpha,11/4/12 17:47,"Some intial thoughts: A / block would be very useful - I had to create confusing code to mimic it (http://alpha.scratch.mit.edu/projects/10005645) Paint Editor: this is a huge improvement, I especially like the line point manipulation If you duplicate a defined block (in trying to copy it elsewhere), you can't then delete the duplicate by dragging into the script block area. You get two identically named blocks in 'More Blocks' area (both of which call the first code you created). You can delete the duplicate by right-clicking. You can delete the definition of a block by right-clicking and pressing delete, even if it has been used in the script. You cannot delete it by dragging it into the script block area if it is in use. You don't seem to be able to drag code into the stage script area from a sprite Will it be possible to make a defined block available to all sprites: I have written a 'walk' block but can't let other sprites use it. This seems like a huge issue to me. Have code comments gone? It is looking great! I can't wait to show my students and teachers. More soon... Rebecca"

Went to draw a sprite, no undo button/clear/redo/zoom ????  - cirlce drawing seems a bit wrong - circle doesn't ""start"" from correct point - vector graphics great for me but I think younger scratchers still going to need a simple bit-mapped paint option. (Understand warnings that its buggy BTW) Could do with tool-tips. Can't see the much asked for x to the power y maths function or even x squared function - but surely it must be in there :) Drop down selection has issues if the dropdown list hits the bottom of the screen - can't cleanly select an item - have to click and hold instead of just clicking. regards Simon"

This saves having to double-click a sprite to get updated x/y co-ords and not requiring double-click skills which would (using Lightnin's phrase :) ) lower the floor for using Scratch as AFAIK nothing else requires it. regards Simon"

14768,Questions and Suggestions for the Scratch 2.0 Alpha,11/8/12 10:57,"1. Maybe it is just me, but sprites seem to move faster in 2.0. For a game, I used a loop with ""move 2 steps"" and ""wait 0.01 sec"". In 1.4 it takes the sprite about 6 seconds to move across the playing area but only 4 seconds in 2.0. Did anyone else experience this?? 2. I really like the ability to make the scripts larger and smaller, but how about the blocks themselves? It's not as critical but it would be nice. 3. In 1.4 it was possible to save scripts as images. This is essential because we use it to create learning materials by creating projects and then documenting them in various ways in an external document. Moti"

As far as I could see, Scratch does not support ""folding"" or ""hiding"" the code for new blocks. We have middle-school kids writing projects with dozens of scripts per sprite, some of them very long. It is often impossible to read and understand them and I dread to think what would happen if someone tried to maintain such a project after it wins a prize on Scratch Day. I was hoping that Scratch 2 would use ""Make block"" as a way of supporting the structuring of programs. PLEASE, please do something! 2. BYOB supports creating functions returning boolean <...> or number (...). Very nice to have but not essential. 3. BYOB supports remote call of a ""procedure"" in another sprite. There is an easy workaround by broadcasting a message and calling the block when it is received so I don't see this as necessary. 4. Something didn't look right and I tracked it down as resulting for my changing the center of rotation of a sprite. I guess that this is to be implemented in the future.

Changes are continuing to be made in the alpha version blocks and wording. Translation has not yet started-- the languages you see there are just temporary placeholders for working out the code. We will be reviewing all the feedback on Save and Autosave. Autosave is the way applications are moving online, so we want to figure out how to do it in a way that makes it as clear as possible. For saving to a local folder, for now you can go to the More menu and click ""Export to local file."" That wording will be changing very soon to  ""Download this file."" You can also open  projects (including 1.4 projects) from the More... menu  ""Open from local file."" There will be a downloadable version of 2.0. In that version, file opening and saving to a local disk will be much more prominent, like in 1.4.

Just drag and drop the code block icons on the stage, set the few paramenters, and your robot will come to life.  What I liked best about the Mindstorms is the ease of programming while teaching the basic fundamentals. Mesh is a network conduit for scratch based programs. It uses IP to allow scratch programs to communicate with each other. You could use this with your robotics, but the robot will need to have a scratch program, access to a network, and the ability to use the IP protocol."

46544,Random Team/Group Program,12/11/16 18:22,"I am the Technology Director at our small private school in Massachusetts.  We just launched a 1:1 Chromebook initiative and I am working with our teachers with some ""out of the box"" ideas to integrate into the Google Classroom and just tech things in general.  That brought me to this idea. What if I wrote a program that the teachers could use to take their class lists and split them into random teams/groups (teams of 2,3 or 4).  Study guides, subject reviews, etc, groups all randomly generated which will push kids to interact with the classmates they don't normally interact with and just to spice things up. I created 8 IMPORT lists (for now), those never get touched after you import your .txt file, they are just referred to by the Selection List.  That then randonly chooses the teams dependent on how many teams are chosen.  I plan to incorporate the whole school soon, prek-8, so those teachers and the Phys Ed teachers can use this random team/group generator.  In my tech class the demo for 7th grade was a hit, they loved the ""lottery"" of where they would end up and how teams/groups were so different every time. Feel free to use if you'd like. Directions: Create a .txt file for each of your homerooms import that to one of the IMPORT lists, just keep track of what sprite handles what list. probably create a new costume for each selection sprite so your class names are displayed properly The program does the rest. I do plan on offering an option for 1 team, or one randomized order. The teachers wanted that option for reading paragraphs, spelling bee, etc in class.  Looks to be a fun resource.  Hope this is something the Educational Community could use.  I had a lot of fun writing it. https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/135318800/"
14615,Raspberry Pi - The MagPi - The Scratch Patch,10/21/12 13:59,"Hi, I am the person responsible for ""The Scratch Patch"" - the articles on Scratch in the MagPi magazine for the Raspberry Pi. I am very grateful to some of the ScratchEd users who have helped me with comments and suggestions on another thread, but I thought I'd make a new one. If you haven't seen the MagPi, you can find it here: http://www.themagpi.com/ The projects that I have featured are all available in my area on the Scratch Forum (I am racypy): http://scratch.mit.edu/galleries/view/169901 The ""bases"" script will be featured in the November edition. Anyway, the reason I am posting this here is that if anyone has any suggestions for ways in which I can improve the Scratch Patch, or ideas for future projects ... I am all ears. mark"
14615,Raspberry Pi - The MagPi - The Scratch Patch,10/21/12 18:31,"Hi Mark, Most of my projects tend to start when I'm trying to think of ways to show how certain blocks or categories of blocks can be used. I'd like to see the Scratch patch move away from the ask, say routines and be a bit more graphical. How about doing some drawing with the Pen? Look at my patterns project. It's really simple as I guess you're pushed for space but the effext is quite nice and can lead to experimenting with different values to produce further patterns. In my favourites there's a project called snow which might be good for the December issue! If you need more help then let me know and I'll see what I can do, Mark"
14615,Raspberry Pi - The MagPi - The Scratch Patch,10/22/12 12:46,"Hi Mark, thanks for your comments. Yes, I should probably go for something more graphical next time. I'll check out your pattern project. I am rather short on space - they only give me 2 pages ... mark"
14615,Raspberry Pi - The MagPi - The Scratch Patch,10/22/12 13:42,Patterns is very short!  For bigger projects maybe you should serialise it?...leave some cliff hangers....coming next month etc!
14615,Raspberry Pi - The MagPi - The Scratch Patch,10/22/12 16:22,Have remixed the snow project and called it xmaspi. Project could be shortened by removing drifts and reducing number of snow sprites. Just an idea!
14615,Raspberry Pi - The MagPi - The Scratch Patch,10/22/12 17:31,"Just one caveat -  Make sure any projects run OK on the Pi e.g avoid displaying variables, don't use sensing key-presses and remember that you can't load any jpg background images.  Although there are some fixes for these issues - they've not been released and anyone just using the standard Raspbian image will have these bugs . Simon"

1209,Reading and Writing with Scratch,10/20/09 11:18,"I'm developing a workshop proposal for using Scratch in secondary English classes and hope I might be able to get some input and feedback. To begin with, I need to decide how to focus my presentation.  Here are a few strands of thought I've considered: Exploring the parallells between games and traditional narratives, particularly how most State Standards of learning for literature can be taught through video games. Using Scratch as an new approach to reader response theory. Developing cross curricular projects (and helping humanities teachers tap into STEM funding streams) Teaching the process of composition with an emphasis on how new collaboration platforms and the fluidity of digital media change the traditional ""Plan, Draft, Revise, Edit, Publish""  approach. Exploring ""Kenetic Text"" and how Timing, Location, Color, and Font have an impact on the meaning of a text (expanding the definition of literacy). Creating relevant writing projects- Reviewing projects, Publishing a Scratch Newspaper, Producing a Scratch series. Integrating Scratch with Moodle. What would you want to learn more about? Which ideas need more clarificatioin?"
1209,Reading and Writing with Scratch,10/20/09 14:43,"I don't have any input for you right now, but I am in total support of this idea, especially for ELS learners."
1209,Reading and Writing with Scratch,10/20/09 17:20,"This sounds great. I like the idea of using Scratch to blur the boundary between stories and games. Don't know if this will be helpful, but I put together a collection of stories (broadly conceived) constructed with Scratch for a Pixar demo. The collection is available at http://web.media.mit.edu/~kbrennan/pixar/"
1209,Reading and Writing with Scratch,10/21/09 20:55,"""Teaching the process of composition with an emphasis on how new collaboration platforms and the fluidity of digital media change the traditional ""Plan, Draft, Revise, Edit, Publish""  approach. "" has my vote.  It reflects the whole converstaion about how school changes to reflect kids' digital lives"
1209,Reading and Writing with Scratch,10/22/09 11:17,"Can you add to the list or thing of another frame to use? Both games and traditional narrative can, and typically do,  have: Common Structural Components Conflict Protagonist Antagonist Setting Plot- Cause and Effect, escalating stakes Exposition P.O.V. Variety of Genres Continum from abstract to concrete- Checkers is abstract; Grand Theft Auto is concrete.  Parrables are abstract; novels are concrete. Variety of Purposes- both can be theraputic, instructional, entertaining. Dynamic Characters Common Audience Experiences Make, test, and revise predictions Make choices Resopnd Emotionally Build Community Can be approached with multiple strategies Frequently require multiple passes to ""resolve."" Safely explore threatening experiences."
1209,Reading and Writing with Scratch,10/23/09 11:24,"Adding to the list of similarities above, writers and game makers must both have the abilitity to identify with their audiences.  They have to be able to imagine, on a moment by moment basis, how their audience will probably react to what has just happened. On to the next big question: Why Bother It's fun May be particularly interesting to boys who are commonly read to solve problems: Reading Don't Fix No Cheveys It's High Interest topic. Students have significant prior knowledge about playing games. Relevent themes/ Essential Questions: Interplay of Tech and Art, Quest for Mastery, Ethics of Art, Interplay of Culture and Personal Choice, Can be easily extended with Nonfiction readings:  The Scratch Manual, the scratch website, News Articles, Editorials 21st Century Literacy: Composition must be taught as a multimedia endevour, game production lends itself to collaboration. Designing and developing interactive presentations will be an essential skill. Writing Games and Training Simulations is a growing profession."
1209,Reading and Writing with Scratch,10/24/09 19:20,"I'm very concrete, so in addition to this framing, I'd love to hear more about particular activities you're thinking about..."
1209,Reading and Writing with Scratch,10/26/09 17:11,"I agree.  The next big question is HOW DO YOU DO IT? I think the best way to get people inspired by Scratch is to let them play with it.  After providing a quick introduction, I plan to let participants work through a project as if they were students. The trick that I have run into in class is creating an assignment that  provides the right balance structure and autonomy. It's all fun and games. . . even when somebody looses an eye My first idea is to base the lesson on a short familiar story, Odysseus' encounter with the cyclops. www.wsu.edu/~dee/MINOA/POLY.HTM After reading the story, particpants will work in triads to create a game inspired by the story.  Based on the technique of pairs programming, there will be a driver (sitting at the keyboard) and a navigator (reading the criteria and Scratch cards.  In addition, there will be a research and development role  will reffer to the original text and search or creating necessary resources (costumes & sound effects). Participants will then use a rubric and review template to give feedback to other projects. Finally, participants will be given reflection questions, a few general, and a few  taylored to the role they played in their production team. I'll be working on creating specific materials over then next few days."
1209,Reading and Writing with Scratch,10/26/09 21:26,"I like the idea of roles. I would like to suggest that the roles be interchangeable after a while eg. if the time allocated for the project is 40 minutes, will it be a good idea to change roles after 20 minutes so that students get to see from a different perspective. An idea to share: How about creating a scenario as in you paint a particular Scratch background and let your students put in their characters.  For example, using the desert background imported from Scratch, have the students discuss desert people, animal and plant life and things associated with the desert. Then form into groups and let them create a project. They must start in the desert but can choose to leave the desert  so  you can include means of transportation in your brainstorming session. Have fun!"
1209,Reading and Writing with Scratch,10/26/09 21:25,"The trick that I have run into in class is creating an assignment that  provides the right balance structure and autonomy. I couldn't agree more. Finding that ""just enough, but not too much"" spot is such a challenge! I thought your use of triads was interesting. Do people get a chance to rotate through the roles?"
1209,Reading and Writing with Scratch,10/26/09 21:37,"Hi. Loved the stories. Really wonderful. Thanks for highlighting them.  Just to let you know that I was able to view all except for Worst Day ever , the third story which did not open. You may want to check that out."
1209,Reading and Writing with Scratch,10/27/09 9:36,"It's interesting that I got two comments about changing roles.  This is a topic that I've discussed with colleagues before.  I tend to keep people in the same roles for much longer than other teachers I know.  When doing project work, my inclination is to keep students in the same role for at least two or three projects.  My day-to-day workgroups may keep the same roles for as long as six weeks.  I think that constantly changing roles creates a fragmented experience for students. It's better for them to master one skill-set than to dabble in all of them. In the context of a workshop for teachers, I'd offer the option of changing roles if there is time to produce more than one project. The problem with the format I originally described is that not everyone actually gets to put their hands on  Scratch.  So perhaps I need to schedule individual play time at the end of the session."
1209,Reading and Writing with Scratch,10/27/09 9:52,"I really like this idea.  Especially as it creates an opportunity for a cross curricular project.  From an English point of view you have an opportunity to reinforce the different types of conflict.  This project would probably be ""man vs. nature,"" unlike typical action games that tend to be ""man vs. man.""  From the science perspective, you have an opportunity to research ecosystems.  And concepts from social studies, such as wants/needs. and environmental factors that lead to the development of cities could be incorporated.   Also, from a programming/math perspective, I see a great opportunity to use variables to track hunger, thirst, and exertion which all contribute to a variable for overall health."
1209,Reading and Writing with Scratch,10/28/09 9:18,"To add to your flow of ideas, you can also look at it from the geography viewpoint and suggest that students in different groups place their characters in deserts in different countries/continents. You can also bring in the idea of desert wars for example,  for a history angle. For example, the character portrays a person who is fighting in the desert or a person who is living in the midst of a desert war, etc.  There is so much to choose from..."
1209,Reading and Writing with Scratch,10/29/09 5:52,"Hi. Moodle is new to me.  Can you explain how you can integrate Moodle with Scratch? By the way, I have another suggestion for you to try out - In the area of Writing, perhaps you may want to use the idea of oral presentations via Scratch pages to explore personal family history.  For example, I am trying to preserve some old Teochew rhymes which I learnt as a child.  Please see http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/aitan/736471 In this project and other similar projects which I will be creating, I hope to be able to publish these rhymes so that my children and grandchildren (if any) etc can benefit from it.  In Singapore, Chinese dialects are dying through non-usage as we speak mainly English or Mandarin, Malay, Tamil and other languages. Many of us live as nuclear families and our children are not exposed to the dialects which their grandparents speak.  I must confess that my knowledge of Teochew is limited and that of my children even less.  As the older generation dies out, we will lose our dialects eventually. I would appreciate any ideas you may have for my Preserving my Teochew heritage project.  Thanks. Best regards, Ai Boon"

26706,Real collaboration?,5/20/14 19:37,"Hi Bob, Unfortunately, there isn't a seamless way to collaborate on Scratch projects.

Attendees: Steven Connelly Janet Dee Ingrid Gustafson Nicole Hart Bobbi Kezirian Lorraine Leo Natalie Paine Ivan Rudnicki Adam Scharfenberger Rosemary Slattery Richard Smyth Daniel Watt Recap: Part 1: Networking and Scheduling: After an informal gathering around our “food table” with coffee, juice, fruit, blueberry cake and Smartfood (delicious anytime!), we introduced ourselves and shared one challenge that we had coming up in the near future around Scratch. Ivan offered his challenge to integrate Scratch into a K-8 curriculum at three Boston charter schools and Nicole shared her challenge to use Scratch in ninth grade math class learning linear equations.  For our first session, we decided to form groups around these two very different topics. Part 2: Collaborating and Generating Ideas In the K-8 curriculum discussion, we brainstormed teacher PD strategies, inquiry learning strategies and workflow for elementary students.  For PD, the group recommended providing strategies for cooperative learning such as “ask 3 and then ask me,” pair programming, assigning roles to students in team projects, and gallery walks. We also talked about the need to implement grade level appropriate computational literacies which can be found in the national CSTA standards. Other resources that were suggested were: ScratchEd website, Creative Computing Curriculum, and CCOW (for PD ideas). In the learning linear equations group, they brainstormed general math applications for Scratch with the intent to find a way to incorporate linear equations. Nicole had a specific idea which was to use the scenario of Lebron James dunking a basketball. Part 3: Our Mini Hackathon For the second session both groups took on the challenge of creating a Scratch project with a basketball theme to demonstrate linear equations. Janet added the challenge to use pair programming as an experience. Five teams accepted the challenge and worked for 45 minutes. During lunch every team shared their solutions. Here are two solutions that were shared on Scratch: Simple slope and intercept: http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/51239584/ Slope-2: http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/51238036/ Everyone agreed that the simple slope and intercept project with one sprite and 7 lines of code would be great for Nicole’s lesson (although it still needs Lebron and a hoop). Dan also shared an example of a simple function machine in Scratch that requires the player to guess the function based on the inputs and outputs. Our next meetup is scheduled for Saturday, April 4, 2015.  We want this to be a big reunion meetup so if you have joined us this year or are a veteran of MIT meetups please mark your calendar, sign up and join us at the Kennedy-Longfellow School in Cambridge."

There was an overwhelming consensus that people were excited about learning more about Scratch as well as learning how educators are using it in their classrooms and other venues. Others were just pleased that it was a beautiful day in Cambridge. All 25 of us then contributed a collection of post-it notes with topic requests. Adam and Barbara accepted the challenge of grouping the notes and created our agenda for the day. Breakout Sessions: Two sets of 45 minute sessions were planned. In the first session we held a Google Hangout with the ScratchEd Meetup concurrently being held in Lexington, KY. (Janet and Leanna had “planned” this ahead of time.)  A big thank you to Maheen for starting the hangout and providing the tech confidence.  We enjoyed hanging out on a Saturday morning with wonderful educators from Kentucky.  Rosemary and Adam led a hands-on introduction to Scratch with a maze project and a pen tool project.  Richard brought his Hangman project for help and inspiration.  The group had great discussions around computer science content. The Scratch projects were very popular and many continued to work on them through the second session.  Carmelo helped Barbara and Willa try out the Little Bits with Scratch. Lorraine led a group looking at ways Scratch can make global connections. Lunch Discussions: The enthusiastic conversations continued over lunch. We shared some projects and announcements (see below). Shout Outs: Our Harvard Interns who joined us today. Carmelo from the MIT Media Lab LLKG for his help with the Little Bits. Leanne Prater and all the educators from Lexington KY for joining us remotely.

The group circled up and everyone introduced themselves by answering questions: What's your name? Where are you from? What do you do? What is one thing/project, inside or outside of your day job, that you are proud of this year? Next, attendees wrote one or two ideas for session topics on post-it notes which were then gathered on the whiteboard. Adam and Ingrid helped group together the sessions into a total of three sessions instead of the usual four. Part 2: Exploring & Learning - Our group had two 45 minute blocks to fill with sessions. In the first block, there were two sessions: Introduction to Scratch and Teaching with Scratch. In the second block, there was a large interest in exploring extensions with Scratch as well as some of the other technology tools in the Kennedy-Longfellow Makerspace, so we created on session called Extensions. Part 3: Sharing & Reflecting - Keeping in the spirit of the Makerspace, we each made our own DIY deli sandwhiches at lunch time with a side of chips, veggies, and salad. During the Show & Tell we had three participants share their projects. Mike Condor shared how he uses Scratch to create designs that he then prints using a laser wood cutter. Richard shared a creative animation he worked on incorporating images and music. Dan shared a particle simluator he created using Scratch. As final words for the meetup, we went around the room and shared one thing we learned and if we achieved our goals for the day.

After a speed networking activity and a huge WELCOME BACK from Karen and Mitch, the group launched into morning breakout sessions. Four groups emerged: Intro to Scratch - During this session, led by Mitch, those who were new to Scratch or wanted a refresher course were able to gain hands-on experience building interactive collage in Scratch. Rubric Review - A group of educators from Suffern, NY are developing an assessment to accompany the Scratch curriculum guide draft and they organized this session to receive feedback on their rubric. Scratch/CS/Java Course Connections - Frank and Stacy led this session to discuss how to make connections between the learning that their students are experiencing with Scratch and Java programming. Scratch Activity Design - Ron, Michelle, and several other educators took this time to brainstorm activities and challenges that might help engage students who are stuck or are struggling to make personal connections with Scratch. After lunch, we had the pleasure of hearing a wide variety of presentations during Show & Tell: Frank discussed strategies for engaging both boys and girls in his class and shared some of the types of projects they created. Jennifer talked about how she uses the Scratch website during class with her 8th graders. Eleanor started a discussion around creating electronic design journals. Claire shared projects that were designed by her fourth graders while learning about lists and variables. Ron shared his experiences working to engage students about the coordinate graph using Scratch. Anne Marie presented games created by 7th and 8th graders during an enrichment course. Ernest shared a sample Scratch project that one of his students created during summer camp. David presented an assessment rubric that he and his colleagues are currently developing to complement their Scratch curriculum unit. Debbie showed a project she developed that creates melodies in Scratch. Julianne presented a draft project and requested feedback on behalf of one of her 5th grade students. Ryan presented student projects that were designed to use lists. Lorraine shared projects made by her K-6 students that illustrate creating, communicating, and collaborating with Scratch. After Show & Tell, we held two more breakout sessions, each lasting 30-minutes. During the first 30-minute period, sessions offered included: EDC/MIT Instrument Design - In this session, Francisco and Karen presented an assessment tool currently in development to evaluate the types of computational thinking skills that students develop while working with Scratch. Intro to Curriculum Guide - Aaron and Michelle invited educators to learn more about the Scratch Curriculum Guide draft and share their experiences from using the guide. The second set of breakout sessions covered: Scratch Website - Jennifer led a group discussion around what challenges and opportunities might arise from integrating the Scratch website as part of the curriculum.

9578,"Reflections on Scratch Educator Meetup @ MIT: Saturday, April 16, 2011",4/17/11 20:38,"Thanks to everyone who was able to join us at MIT for yesterday's Scratch educator meetup! Here are some notes, reflections, and next steps... 1. Things we saw in Show & Tell Videos of the Show & Tell presentations will be posted later this week. In the meantime, here are some notes: Tom Kowalczyk shared some of the work that he's doing in the domain of K-12 workforce development. Anushka Paul shared the project she developed during the meetup, based on the collision game from the Let's Play handouts. Abby Miller shared resources that she developed for her students (step-by-step and Scratch puzzles) and will hopefully share on ScratchEd! Jesse Raymond shared a space-themed project he created that models gravity. 2. For the beginners After showing various sample projects to demonstrate the possibilities of Scratch creation, we had an hour and a half of hands-on time with Scratch. The suggested activity was to create an interactive collage, but several different paths were explored including trying out the Scratch card activities and checking out the Scratch sample projects that come with Scratch (e.g. Simple Circuits). If yesterday was your first experience with Scratch (or you want a refresher), here are some other resources that you might want to check out, to support your further explorations with Scratch. Getting started guide - How to make a first Scratch project. Design studio activities - 16 suggestions for design activities, such as making a project that includes the ""random"" block or making a project that has an orange square and purple circle. Creative computing workshop - This is a sequence of activities for getting started with Scratch. Any feedback on the sequence and activities would be appreciated. How could it be changed to be more useful? 3. Intermediate breakout Those with more experience followed a few different tracks, but several people got together to explore Scratch's game-making potential, with some people using the Let's Play handouts as a reference and others pursuing their own challenges, such as implementing a version of Pac-Man. 4. Future events There are lots of ways to keep participating in ScratchEd professional development: Hang out on ScratchEd Come to the monthly meetups - Next month's meetup is a bit different, as it coincides with Scratch Day. Registration for Scratch Day MIT opens at the beginning of May. Attend the monthly webinars - The next webinar is all about computational practices and is taking place on Monday, April 25 at 7pm EST. Thanks again for attending yesterday's event. We look forward to seeing you at MIT for Scratch Day and on ScratchEd in the interim! K"

Some notes, reflections, and next steps... 1. Things we saw in Show & Tell I love Show & Tell because I'm always surprised and always learn something new. Here's what we heard in today's Show & Tell session: Lorraine Leo shared some of her students' projects, and details of her Scratch Day collaboration with Yoshiro Miyata of Japan. Vicki Gold shared some of the projects her students have been creating, including a challenging project by superzipzop! In the process, we learned how to save scripts as pictures (right-clicking or control-clicking on the Scripts area) and how to write summary of a project to a text file (shift-clicking the ""File"" menu and selecting the ""Write Project Summary"" menu item). Lisa Radden shared her experiences with the TechSperts program, including her blog where students are posting their Scratch reflections. Sandra Bleecker, Janet Dee, and Vicki Gold demonstrated a project they co-created during today's meetup - an interactive recording/playback drawing project. A nice collaboration that I hope they'll post and share a link to! 2. For the beginners I had a lot of fun working with the people who were having their very first Scratch experiences. Here are some resources that you might want to check out, to support your further explorations with Scratch. Getting started guide - How to make a first Scratch project. Scratch cards - Twelve cards that illustrate a basic Scratch technique (such as keeping score or playing with graphic effects). Design studio activities - 16 suggestions for design activities, such as making a project that includes the ""random"" block or making a project that has an orange square and purple circle. Creative computing workshop - This is something I just finished -- I haven't event posted the sum as a resource on ScratchEd yet! This is a sequence of activities for getting started with Scratch. Any feedback on the sequence and activities would be appreciated. How could it be changed to be more useful? 3. Future events There are lots of ways to keep participating in ScratchEd professional development: Hang out on ScratchEd Come to the monthly meetups - Register for next month's meetup and be notified about future events through the quarterly newsletter. Attend the monthly webinars - The next webinar is all about Scratch Day and is taking place on Monday, February 28 at 7pm EST. 4. What's next? We asked people to record their thoughts about what might be next for them and might be next for our next meetup. Here's what was shared on sticky notes: Experimenting! teaching my own kids Playing/learning more about Scratch, so I can teach to others More in-depth with PicoBoard Go home today and play; get lessons for ELA project I came in today knowing NOTHING about Scratch. I am excited now to brainstorm & look @ other people's projects to see how I can use it, specifically w/my young students. After this workshop I hope to learn how to further develop what I have learned and bring it into my curriculum. Recruit more teachers to attend next teacher meetup Going back and completing the online tutorial, then apply! Keep playing with Scratch, get more comfortable, so I can teach it. Collaborate with other classes. Get more knowledge, meet more new Scratchers Next meeting: learn more advanced skills Have Modkit creator as part of groupBring a friend to next meetup Modkit break out group Thanks again for attending today's event. We look forward to seeing you at MIT in March and on ScratchEd in the interim! K P.S. Video from Michelle..."

9361,"Reflections on Scratch Educator Meetup @ MIT: Saturday, March 19, 2011",3/20/11 10:16,"Thanks to everyone who was able to join us at MIT for yesterday's Scratch educator meetup! Here are some notes, reflections, and next steps... 1. Things we saw in Show & Tell Videos of the Show & Tell presentations will be posted later this week. In the meantime, here are some notes: Rosemary Slattery shared some great student work. First, she showed a project that one of her students made, based on the Orange Square, Purple Circle activity. This student took the orange square, purple circle activity in an unexpected direction by creating a musical guessing game, programming songs note-by-note. You can check out his project online at http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/BBoyRiser/1655816. Rosemary also shared the St. Patrick's Day themed mazes her students had created, such as http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/LucKy_LKY/1661821 Sandie Bleecker shared her ongoing explorations with the PicoBoard. She described how she turned to her own kids for ideas -- and how they co-developed a PicoBoard-based joystick. Janet Dee talked about the power of students sharing their work with each other and building on each other's work. She shared a particular example -- Jimmy's circus game -- and how that project evolved with different people's contributions Abby Miller shared handouts that she had developed to support her students getting started with Scratch -- and talked about her surprise when the students did everything other than what was on the handouts. :) I thought this led to a great discussion about structure and support. 2. For the beginners If yesterday was your first experience with Scratch (or you want a refresher), here are some resources that you might want to check out, to support your further explorations with Scratch. Getting started guide - How to make a first Scratch project. Scratch cards - Twelve cards that illustrate a basic Scratch technique (such as keeping score or playing with graphic effects). Design studio activities - 16 suggestions for design activities, such as making a project that includes the ""random"" block or making a project that has an orange square and purple circle. Creative computing workshop - This is a sequence of activities for getting started with Scratch. Any feedback on the sequence and activities would be appreciated. How could it be changed to be more useful? 3. Intermediate breakout I really enjoyed the intermediate breakout session. We sat around and discussed a wide range of topics: debugging, remixing, broadcasting, and more. For debugging, we spent some time discussing what debugging is and strategies for debugging. Here's a list of strategies that we developed in the course of our discussion (which involved looking at debugging activities, talking about our own experiences, and trying debug a student's project): use storyboards to think about the steps that would be involved talk through goals and approach explain to someone else what you want to have happen peer editing being incremental testing in a modular way examine how different stacks of code get started print out the scripts to see them side by side put ""markers"" in the code, debugging flag think about properties of the tool (e.g. rotation, costume center) annotate your work with comments single stepping (""Start single stepping"" under the Edit menu, which highlights what blocks are being run) For remixing (taking someone else's project, changing it, and sharing the modified -- or ""remixed"" -- version), we looked at remixes of a project ""For the people of Japan"". Under any remixed project, there's a count of the remixes, which is a link to a visualization of the remixes, like this one. 4. Future events There are lots of ways to keep participating in ScratchEd professional development: Hang out on ScratchEd Come to the monthly meetups - Register for next month's meetup and be notified about future events through the quarterly newsletter. Attend the monthly webinars - The next webinar is all about computational concepts and is taking place on Monday, March 28 at 7pm EST. More hands-on Scratch - I'll be facilitating a hands-on Scratch workshop this Thursday from 1pm to 5pm at the ICA, if you're interested in getting more Scratch practice. 5. What's next? We asked people to record their thoughts about what might be next for them and might be next for our next meetup. Here's what was shared on sticky notes: I'm going to make my own Scratch cards and a rubric (or several) for evaluating student projects. Next for me - learn through creating projects. Would love to see samples or examples of operators and sensing palettes. Next for me - to organize what I learned from leading the Scratch teacher professional development. Challenges - What's next! Next meetup: Try to create a new project with support, after playing on my own for a month. Exploring use of Scratch project remixes. Next for meetup: More of everything. Get colleagues on board. I would like to see other people's materials and ""trade"" projects, assignments, ideas, rubrics, handouts, etc. I'm interested in the incorporation of media elements. Also, understanding how to integrate procedures from small projects into programs. Thanks again for attending today's event. We look forward to seeing you at MIT in April and on ScratchEd in the interim! K"

9660,"Reflections on Scratch Educator Meetup in NYC: Thursday, April 28, 2011",5/3/11 6:11,"Thanks to everyone who was able to join us last Thursday for our first on-the-road Scratch educator meetup in NYC! Here are some notes, reflections, and next steps... 0. Summary video of the meetup 1. Things we saw in Show & Tell Videos of the Show & Tell presentations are available online in the resources section and include: Nancy Costa shared animated Aesop's Fables that were created in her 3rd-5th grade Technology Class. Lou Lahana aka Techbrarian presented his curriculum for helping elementary and middle school students express social issues through Scratch projects and blogging. LeRhonda Greats showed us the first sprite she ever created and animated in Scratch. She talked about what was challenging about the project and how she used a clever costume technique to make her sprite dance. Susan Ettenheim and Francisco Cervantes presented Public Service Announcements (PSA) created by students in Susan's HS Animation course. Susan asked the group for suggestions on sharing student work and collaborating with other educators on her Scratch Cards project. David Wells presented his very first Scratch project, which he created at the NYC Meetup during a hands-on session. The project was based on the Interactive Collage activity, following an architecture theme. Donald Dagen, a volunteer educator for an after-school program, presented a 5th grade girl's Pacman project. 2. For the beginners We had about an hour of hands-on time with Scratch. The suggested activity was to create an interactive collage, but several different paths were explored including trying out the Scratch card activities and checking out the Scratch website. If this was your first experience with Scratch (or you want a refresher), here are some other resources that you might want to check out, to support your further explorations with Scratch. Getting started guide - How to make a first Scratch project. Design studio activities - 16 suggestions for design activities, such as making a project that includes the ""random"" block or making a project that has an orange square and purple circle. Creative computing workshop - This is a sequence of activities for getting started with Scratch. Any feedback on the sequence and activities would be appreciated. How could it be changed to be more useful? 3. Breakouts Mitch wrote a brief description of the breakout session he led around ""challenges"" (check out the activity and a demonstration video): In the breakout group, which had about 10 people, we divided time between hands-on ""challenges"" and discussion. The challenges were designed to explore different ways of adding interactivity to a Scratch project. For example, one challenge was: ""Whenever a sprite hears a sound, it changes color."" Everyone in the breakout created scripts in response to the challenge, then compared the different approaches used by different people. We discussed how the challenges could be used in the classroom -- and, more broadly, what types of activities are best for connecting with students' interests, while also helping them learn important computational ideas. Cameron wrote a brief description of the breakout session he led around ""computational thinking"": We had an engaging discussion of the various concepts and principles that comprise CT. To guide our discussion, I utilized the Big Ideas of Computational Thinking outlined by the Scratch Team.  To shape our discussion and examine CT from both a theoretical and applied perspective, we addressed the first two of three CT Big Ideas, concepts, and practices. In terms of CT concepts, we examined how Scratch provides useful concepts that are directly applicable to computer programming and that these blocks (such as loop, event, operator, and variable blocks) generate an accessible entry point for thinking about CT with Scratch. Next, we discussed the various CT practices. These four practices, incremental/iterative, testing/debugging, reusing/remixing, and abstracting/modularizing, are ideas that can be both applied to computer programming and core content areas within the primary and secondary school setting. A third breakout session focused on a discussion of video games. 4.

Three of the teachers from Lexington had a chance to attend a fabulous Scratch Educator Meetup in NYC earlier this school year, so we were really excited to bring the meetups to our area. The Scratch Ed Meetup Guide was extremely helpful in organizing our event.  Thank you Scratch Ed team for putting together a fantastic resource! We had 26 attendees including teachers, school administrators, college professors and community partners. After a brief welcome, we began the morning with a overview of what a meetup is and how it is a great way to build and support a community of Scratch Educators in Kentucky.  Keeping in the unconference format, participants wrote two things they wanted to learn, disuss or share while at the meetup for building our sessions.  We completed the ""Meet Up with"" activity from the Scratch Ed Meetup Guide and then broke off into interest groups.  Since this was our first meetup, we had three session: Beginning Scratch, Elementary Integration Ideas and Middle/High Integration Ideas.  Groups met for an hour, with great discussion on everything from ways to introduce Scratch to students to connecting Scratch to content standards. We wrapped up our morning with a great lunch sponsered by our Kentucky Society for Technology Education (KySTE) and conversations of future meetups. We've created a Google + Community to continue conversations and post information regarding our meetups!"

In this project https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/107972743/ you'll find 23 sprites and 7 backdrops. Just let your children remix it, choose some of the sprites and backdrops (you can discard the rest) and create a story (or animation, art, game) about the refugee crisis. Of course you they can also add new sprites and backdrops!

32494,Remixing / stealing / ethics question.,2/20/15 17:18,"Hi Scratch Educators, I hope someone can give me some advice about a situation I've seen pop up often enough to worry me. I've had the conversation with my students often about giving credit for ideas they use online. I have one student that added a project to our class studio that is identical to a really popular featured program created by another user. The program is called ""Neon Ride"". The student of mine is claiming credit for it - that he made it under a different account a while ago, and moved it. There are some things going on in the comments of these programs that I'm not comfortable with, and I need to put a stop to it when I see the kids next week. My student's project: http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/48612296/ The other, more popular project: http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/30133706/ In a nutshell, a couple of users are using the comments to accuse my student of copying the program without remixing, and my student is using the comments to accuse the other user of copying. There is a little name-calling as well. After all of the discussions we've had in class about proper etiquette and plagiarism, I don't feel like I can just ignore it. Some of the comments are visible in the studio I set up for the kids to share their programs. I was wondering how you would handle this as a teacher, or if referring it to Scratch administrators is a more proper thing to do? Thanks Dawn"

12673,Remote Sensor Protocol?,5/24/12 7:44,"Oh... Scratch+WeDo is one of the main reasons why I'm interested in Scratch for my own kids and considering introducing it to their school: I can think of no better way to show kids that programming is also about the REAL (physical) world! It would definitely be a pity if children are either directed to use the old Scratch or the very limited WeDo software. Actually (...and now I almost feel rude for mentioning it) - I was in fact hoping that Scratch 2.0 would address not only Lego WeDo but also the ""next step"", namely Lego Mindstorms. Mindstorms is the closest there is to a de facto standard for robitics for kids out there. Dare I ask if Scratch+Mindstorms is even mentioned among the developers? (Note: I'm aware of the Enchanting modification for Mindstorms but this is not only based on Scratch). Thank you very much (...and I'm really hoping WeDo will be prioritized) /Mat"
12673,Remote Sensor Protocol?,5/24/12 9:23,"Thanks - something similar to the remote sensor protocol would be great, there are projects like ScratchConnect (yengawa.com/ScratchConnect) that use the existing remote sensor protocol to good end.  Hardware projects like WeDo, picoboards, SunSPOTs, Mindstorms, Arduino are all extremely useful if ther'es a way to hook into them using Scratch for workshops and various projects.  Thanks so much for keeping remote sensor protocol on the drawing board as a to do item for Scratch 2.0!  Best regards, -- DanG"
12673,Remote Sensor Protocol?,5/27/12 10:14,"Hi, Mat. We plan to support the WeDo and Scratch Sensor Board, as in Scratch 1.4. We also plan to extend the WeDo support over time to to support multiple WeDo hubs and control over multiple motors. And, in the long term, we'll make it possible others to connect Scratch to other sensors and devices (e.g. the Microsoft Kinect) with a mechanism similar to the current Remote Sensors Protocol. However, we want to get Scratch 2.0 lauched as soon as possible, so it may launch without some or all of these features and they will be introduced over time. As of now, we don't plan to do anything with Scratch and LEGO Mindstorms -- but thanks for the suggestion. Note that, unlike the WeDo, Mindstorms is npt designed to remain ""tethered"" to the user's computer, so once the Mindstorms was programmed it would not interact with Scratch. It would be nice to have Scratch-like tool for programming the Mindstorms, but such a tool would be better as it's own thing, rather than as an extension of Scratch. -- John"

Lego Mindstorms: Actually it features bluetooth so it can be interacting with the computer directly, as far as I understand. (see eg: http://mindstorms.lego.com/en-us/bluetooth/default.aspx ) Vaguely related: I found a very interesting project called ModKit Micro, which is a graphical programming language to program micro crontrollers (Arduinos) that is very much inspired by Scratch. Check out their kickstarter funding page: http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/modkit/modkit-micro-the-easiest-way-to-program-microcontr (BTW, I note both the Scratch team and the ModKit team are MIT based, so maybe you know eachothers ;-) Again, thank you for your kind answer John! /Mat"

Two channels are necessary for driving and steering the robot, then it would be lovely to connect sensors, additional motors etc., which is possible in regular WeDo software (up to 3 hubs).

Like only 4th graders can do, they found the few projects that were not Intro projects created by CCOW but random projects that were not entirely appropiate for viewing in a school setting.  One was a shooter game, and another was a project that shows an ax striking a character in the head.   Is there anyway that these projects can be removed from this studio?   Attached is a screenshot showing the projects.

4197,Removing the background on imported pictures?,5/23/10 14:39,"Hi Barb, I think this would be a task better suited for a 3rd party photo editing software like Photoshop or perhaps the Gimp. They include tools that make selecting and removing backgrounds easy, especially solid colors. The Paint Editor in Scratch has an eraser tool that you could use to remove the background, but it'll be tough following the silhouette of the portrait to cleanly remove the background. Mike"
4197,Removing the background on imported pictures?,5/23/10 18:45,"Hi Barb, This is really easy to do with Scratch. In the image editor, you can select the Fill tool, then the ""transparent"" color (the grey/white checkerboard pattern) in the color palette. Hope that helps! K"
4197,Removing the background on imported pictures?,5/23/10 21:50,It looks like we will have to use a combination of the transparency fill and the eraser in Scratch.  The greenscreen pictures don't give a perfect background and shadows near people are hard to erase.
4197,Removing the background on imported pictures?,5/23/10 22:33,How do you do it in GIMP?  I downloaded it but can't figure out a good way to do it.
4197,Removing the background on imported pictures?,5/24/10 14:48,"GIMP has something called the Fuzzy Select Tool (looks like a wand in the tool palette). When you touch the fuzzy select tool to a spot of color it selects all the entire area of color. You can then delete it, which will leave a white background in place of the deleted color. If you want a transparent background, add an alpha layer (from Layers > Transparency) before you use the fuzzy select tool. Then when you delete the block of color you'll have a checkerboard pattern, like Karen described with the transparency fill. Since you have shadows on your green background, using this tool will take out large chunks of the background at one time, but it won't get you as clean of an outline as you might want. GIMP also has a tool called the Free Select Tool (looks like a lasso). This lets you outline parts of your image so you can delete it. I don't have the patience to edit images like this, but you might :). The best advice I would give you is to find a graphic designer to do this for you. A more practical ti would be to zoom in on your image and work with small areas at one time. There's probably other ways to acomplish this. Best to experiment. Mike"

11800,resources for an afterschool Scratch club for 4th-5th graders,2/6/12 16:29,"Hi, I have been asked to teach Scratch in a once-a-week afterschool class for  4th and 5th graders. I am a computer science faculty member, so I am used to teaching undergrads. I have a little experience with Scratch, mainly from helping my 11 year old son who uses it. I also am teaching AppInventor this semester to undergrads who have never programmed before - AppInventor has a lot of similarities to Scratch.  I would like to do this  because our school district is badly lacking in computer science content at any level. However, I am also seriously time-slammed so I am hesitating about taking this on. So my questions are First, is this even realistic? Our school district is good, and the kids are sharp, but will they be able to do anything at all in Scratch given the constrained nature of the program? And, if I take this on, I only have 3 weeks to prepare, with little spare time due to my regular teaching and research commitments - are there resources out there aimed at this age group? I don't have any experience teaching kids except for working with my own. I know I would need appropriate projects and materials in order to do this since I don't have the expertise or time to develop anything. Is this a really Bad Idea, or is it a Good Idea to take this on? thanks, Bonnie MacKellar"
11800,resources for an afterschool Scratch club for 4th-5th graders,2/6/12 18:50,I think this is a really good idea. :) Have you seen the Scratch curriculum guide?
11800,resources for an afterschool Scratch club for 4th-5th graders,2/6/12 19:16,"Hi, Yes, that was one of the first things I looked at. It seems like it is aimed at college students, or advanced high school students though. It is definitely way too much and too serious for an elementary afterschool club.  Also, all I could find was a large Word document that refers to handouts. Am I missing something? thanks, Bonnie"
11800,resources for an afterschool Scratch club for 4th-5th graders,2/6/12 19:44,"I agree that there's additional structure that doesn't make sense for afterschool, but the activities (e.g. handouts that are located at the end of the guide) can work. I ran an afterschool program for 4th and 5th graders that use the activities in the guide -- Something Surprising, All About Me, Dance Party, etc. -- not as prescribed activities, but as potential activities for kids to work on. I'd show a small aspect of Scratch, then let people loose to work on their own projects. Something that has also worked well for me is to show a little each session, point kids to the Scratch online community or to the Scratch Cards. Hope that helps!"
11800,resources for an afterschool Scratch club for 4th-5th graders,2/6/12 20:21,We won't be able to use the online community unfortunately! That isn't allowed in our district. I will check out the Scratch cards. Thanks!

Unfortunately, the word just came down from the district IT office that we can't run this program because they won't allow Scratch to be installed on the school computers. I may try to meet with them to convince them that it would be OK, so we could do the club next year. However, it is now too late for this year. Very sad."
11800,resources for an afterschool Scratch club for 4th-5th graders,2/10/12 10:41,"Hi Bonnie - So sad! Do you think they don't understand what Scratch is? Is such an easy, small, FREE application to install. Best of luck getting Scratch in your district. If you get the chance to get this going, I agree with what others I have said. I have an afterschool Scratch Club with about 30 students grades 3-7. I rely heavily on the Scratch Cards (I have 20 sets), and the sample projects from the Curriculum Guide. I printed those out in color and laminated a bunch to have for project starters for students.  I've also done 3 minute challenges where we toss out an idea and everyone tries to do it in 3 minutes, sharing successful projects. An important thing to keep in mind is having a goal to build towards - we share our projects at the Math Carnival night in March as well as at Art Night in May. We've also had a Share Day where parents are invited to the Club to view student projects - we had half the students sharing at a time so the students had the chance to view each other's work."
11800,resources for an afterschool Scratch club for 4th-5th graders,2/10/12 10:46,"Hi Bonnie, that's too bad. I also ran into the same road block when I tried to get a Scratch Club started at my son's middle school (6-8th grades) one spring. It's very hard to get schools to change anything in the middle of the year, and I was asking them to install a 'beta' version too which was viewed with suspicion. However, at the end of that school year I recruited support from a teacher in the school, and over the summer we got them to install Scratch on the computers, and started the club the following fall. That was six years ago, and the Scratch Club is still going strong (and the principal promotes it to incoming 5th graders when they visit!). So my advice would be to start asking for Scratch to be put on computers at the end of this school year, and to keep asking over the summer. If you wait until August they will probably have already decided what updates they're doing and it may be too late. Good Luck! --Chris"

We intend the rubric to be used as a tool for both students and teachers to evaluate the major projects in the unit: Dance party, Storytelling, Art, Games, and a final project. You'll also notice that there are notes in the document, intended for teachers' eyes.

16564,Run control blocks until receiving broadcast message?,2/25/13 14:28,Will Scratch 2.0 support the ability to run control blocks (e.g. Repeat until) until receiving a broadcast message?
16564,Run control blocks until receiving broadcast message?,2/26/13 9:26,"Can't see a diffeence between 1.4 and 2 here. Can't you use a variable? e.g. Broadcast ""Something"", When I receive ""Something"" then set ""variable"" to ""true"" then just have Repeat Until ""variable"" = ""true"""
16564,Run control blocks until receiving broadcast message?,2/26/13 9:55,"Yes, you can use a variable, and that is what I have taught my students to do, but it is an extra step.  It seems like incorporating support for using the broadcast as a condition would be something many people would naturally want to use."
16564,Run control blocks until receiving broadcast message?,2/26/13 11:37,A broadcast is an event. Expecting to test for it as a condition is not natural as you can't guarantee that the condition would be executing when the event is broadcast hence the need for a variable to store the fact that an event has happened. I'd even go as far to say that the condition would always be false and so the repeat would never end without using a variable. It would be the ultimate race condition and so not something that would be implemented.

16272,Sacrificing aesthetics for the sake of learning to program,2/5/13 17:30,"HI! I am an artist and an art educator.  Within the past two years, I have become very interested in incorporating technology in my lessons for children.  Now I am teaching video game design with Scratch and the new course I am desiging is not very long in time.  I am thinking the children may not have time to draw their own original sprites and stages.  Ultimately they will have to use the already created sprites and stages which they will have to import from the files of images saved in Scratch.  This sacrifice of drawing their own sprite and stage upsets the artist side of me. Do you think it is a bad idea to have the chldren use the already created sprites and stages for the sake of saving time to learn the programming? The goal of the course is to teach children, whom have never used computers before, to confidently use computers and to problem solve with technology. Thank you for any advice you can give. Best, Tiffany"
16272,Sacrificing aesthetics for the sake of learning to program,2/10/13 7:10,"Perhaps I am NOT the best person to reply to this since I have a bias toward software engineering (More than 30 years working on the software development side.)  But here goes... I spend only one week teaching the kids to develop their own artwork.  It is enough time to become familiar with the tool and to give them a taste of exercising their artistic muscles.  BYOB/Scratch is not the right tool for learning this discipline.  If I were to devote more time, I would teach them to use Photoshop, Illustrator, and/or Gimp.  BYOB provides an interesting mechanism for using created graphics, but a poor tool for creating them. The course I teach is a course in software engineering.  I try to expose the kids to a wide variety of information which focuses on software engineering.  As I mentioned before, this includes a week of drawing sprites as I see this being an important part of development, but in addition to the basics, I dive into recursion, artificial intelligence, algorithmic complexity, software testing, etc.  In addition, I use other tools to dip into web development, database development, etc...  I also spend a week developing sound effects for which BYOB/Scratch has a record button but no editing/modification features so I have to introduce another tool there (Audacity). We spend a significant amount of time collaborating on projects with different teams developing pieces of programs which are consumed by the group.  I also have them develop code within frameworks that allow them to focus on the concepts we are trying to learn.  Leveraging the work of others is critical to developing software which exceeds human capability to develop in a reasonable time frame, if at all... How many man-hours are represented by any of the applications you run today? I introduce them to free resources on the web for sprites and sounds and recommend they use them/modify them as needed.  I want to expose them to a variety of concepts from which they can take more specialized courses in the future.  In the end my goal is for them to learn to write basic programs (which in BYOB thankfully is a lot of fun video games) and to become familiar with the tools needed should they wish to pursue other avenues for career interest. So I guess the short answer is (too late, I know) I do not think it is a bad idea to teach the kids to leverage the work of others for the sake of learning programming.  On the contrary, I think it is critical to their success."
16272,Sacrificing aesthetics for the sake of learning to program,2/12/13 11:20,Looking back at the goal of the course I now see how it is ok to use the already created sprites and stages.
16272,Sacrificing aesthetics for the sake of learning to program,2/12/13 11:21,"Dear Al, Thank you for your thoughtful reply.  Now looking back at my question, I feel that it is ok to allow my students to utilize the sprites and stages that others created because it gives them more time to program, which is the ultimate goal of the program.  I will follow your lead in using the beginning of the course to teach the ways to use the various drawing tools then after that we will mostly use our time to program. My students will be using computers for the first time and as a matter of fact it might be the first time that they have ever seen a computer so I want to keep my lessons focused and simple.  I need to be careful not to overwhelm them or intimidate them with my course. When teaching your course do you use a projector to demonstrate how to create a game?  The classrooms for this course will not have projectors so I am trying to think of other ways to help the teachers explain how to move blocks around without them having to go to each student individually.  Do you have any suggestions? Flash cards?  Felt boards with movable pieces? Do you have any of your students games posted on Scratch? I really appreciate your advice and I look forward to hearing from you! Best,"
16272,Sacrificing aesthetics for the sake of learning to program,6/5/13 8:31,"It can be fun to customise the existing sprites too, which provides a balance between getting rapid results and enabling students to express themselves."
16272,Sacrificing aesthetics for the sake of learning to program,6/5/13 11:18,That's a good point Sean.  I forgot about that option.  I will make some customized sprites to show my students the different options. Thank you! Tiffany
16272,Sacrificing aesthetics for the sake of learning to program,6/23/13 15:18,"As a first time Scratch teacher myself, I think it's OK to use canned sprites, get 'em going on the simple logic programming, then steer the kids to a more customized stage background. You didn't mention the student's grade & class size, do you feel they're mostly budding artist ? Or geeks &hackers to-be ? I think we're all guilty of teaching what we know.  Being a software developer myself, I naturally lean on the programming & logic side of teaching.  To be honest, Scratch drawing tools isn't that great ... Video game design is a field right-down-the-middle, Maybe you can guide them with story book outline, skeatch out the game board & sprite interactions, get small pieces working, then go back & pretty it up on asethics."

42312,"San Francisco Scratch Educator Meetup: Saturday, May 7, 2016",5/8/16 10:23,"In conversation Saturday, a woman told me that some of the others at her school are against bringing Scratch into the curriculum because they feel the additional task of learning Scratch themselves might overwhelm them. To counter that objection, she recalled this old Jewish fable: A farmer visits his rabbi and says ""Rabbi, my house is too small. There is my wife with all her furniture and the kids with their pets, and the walls are closing in!"". The rabbi replies: ""You're a farmer, yes? You have pigs? Goats? Cows?"" The fellow nods, and the rabbi says: ""Move the pigs into the house."" ""What!?"" ""Just do it."" The man goes home, and following instructions, he moves the pigs into the house. And the next time he visits the rabbi, he says: ""Rabbi, these pigs are mucking up the place, and there is less room than before!"" ""Move the goats and cows into the house."" ""Huh?!"" the man says, but he actually returns to his home with his wife and her furniture, the kids and their pets, plus the newly-resident pigs, and he manages to stuff the other farm animals into the house. Again he returns to the rabbi, now with an escalated tale of woe and insufficient living space. The rabbi says: ""OK, move the farm animals back outside."" And when he returns the cows and goats, the farmer sees much more space in his home, though the pigs are still in it. He realizes that things aren't as bad as they seem, they can always get worse. -30- To me, that seemed like a fine story to tell her teachers who thought adopting Scratch would be the proverbial straw on a camel's back. But they continue to decline, she said. Then she tells me a related episode about introducing Alice to her students, some of whom were uninspired because they thought the Alice environment was too much to handle. But when Scratch entered the picture, those kids were pleased to find Scratch's UI less intimidating, and worked happily in her classs for the remainder of the year. I said: That's like my story. When I thought to start teaching programming, I looked for a teaching language to learn, but I couldn't deal with Alice. Then Scratch showed up, and I'm running with it. Then I realized that by giving up on Alice before embracing the less-weighty Scratch, her students and I were also farmers moving animals in and out of the house."

Last year, just as school was ending I had a child come up against some--not obscene--but certainly rude comments about a posted project. His parents stepped in, deleted his wiki account, and nailed me with some highly critical accusations for putting their child at risk for negative comments. Realizing that helicopter parents exist, what are other educators doing? Currently I am posting only certain student projects in a school account, but that seems counter to the spirit of the wiki sharing...Just opening up the topic for discussion.

4248,School systems sharing a single IP / Network address....,5/24/10 14:04,"Greetings everyone.  I manage moderation on the Scratch website. We've run into a few problems having to do with schools using a single IP address, so I thought I'd post about them here. If anyone has thoughts or ideas for solutions, we'd love to hear them! As with all websites that allows sharing of user generated content, the Scratch website has to have a means of blocking sources of disrespectful or otherwise inappropriate material. We can do this by blocking accounts, but of course it's very easy to make a new one.  In cases where users make multiple accounts to troll or post disrespectful content (usually mean or unconstructive comments), we resort to blocking access from the offending account's network or IP address. In many cases this works well - the source is blocked, and the user is invited to send us an email to discuss the situation and ask to be unblocked.  However, when the source of the inappropriate comments or content is a student from a school that uses a single external IP address, we are often forced to block many more users than we would like to. Often schools use a single external IP address through which all requests to and from the internet are funneled. This means that if we are forced to block access from this IP address, the entire school gets blocked.  When entire school districts share a single IP address, the situation is even worse.  We end up having to block an entire school district's access because one student on one computer in one classroom was acting inappropriately. Unfortunately, it's hard to find a good solution to this problem from our end.  The centralized architecture of a school or schools sharing a single IP address leaves us with no alternative but to block the access of many classrooms to prevent access from a single user. If you have any ideas about ways to better address this issue, we'd love to hear them!  If this issue has affected your school in the past,  perhaps you can send a link to this post to your IT specialists, so they can consider this scenario."
4248,School systems sharing a single IP / Network address....,6/2/10 23:03,"Hey Amos, sounds like a head scratcher. First of all, assuming you have easy access to your IP logs, you can continue to block IP addresses that are only utilized by a single user. It's not an ideal solution to begin with but it's not out of the question. In the event that a problem user is utilizing an IP address shared among many Scratch members, you might consider waiting to inform the user that their account has been suspended until they attempt to login. At that point you can set a cookie on the machine that, when present, prevents the registration of new accounts and/or the use of existing accounts from that specific machine. This could be a traditional browser cookie or an Adobe Flash based cookie. A Flash cookie is going to be browser agnostic and a little more difficult to delete, if only because a lot of users don't know about them, but obviously requires the Flash plugin to be installed. It's not a bullet proof solution and it might prevent subsequent students on the same machine from being able to use Scratch until the cookie is deleted or expired but it's better than blocking an entire school and it might be enough to deter or stem repeated abuse."
4248,School systems sharing a single IP / Network address....,6/3/10 9:35,"Thanks for the ideas, Greg! Adding a cookie might be a good way of at least temporarily disabling access from a single computer - as long as the user doesn't know how to clear their cache. We may have to consider that for the future."
4248,School systems sharing a single IP / Network address....,6/6/10 21:13,"If you note the time of the offence, you might get the school district to look in their logs—if they have them—to see what computer was used and track down the student. Or perhaps you could enable a mode for troublesome IPs where all “contributions” have to be moderated."
4248,School systems sharing a single IP / Network address....,6/17/10 9:25,"Hi Dave - That's a good idea. Perhaps we could include the timestamp of the inappropriate comments in the message that is displayed when acccess is blocked. If the teacher who sees this information can connect with the IT person who has the logs, they might be able to locate the computer that was used to make the comments. Changing a school to 'highly moderated' mode or some kind of probationary status might help solve the problem as well. Unfortunately, this would be a very energy intensive process.  We've considered the possibility of giving teachers a different status on the website, and ccing reports of inappropriate content by associatied student accounts to them. But teachers are often quite busy! So we're not sure if that would be a good solution."
4248,School systems sharing a single IP / Network address....,3/13/15 5:37,"Bumping this post as I would like to ask if there has been any development on this? I am the sysadmin in a school that shares an IP with the rest of our county's schools, so we're a prime example of the situation the OP gave. We have been advised that there has been some form of non-guidline-compliant content from our IP.  This only happens when I set up a user account (any way to set these up in bulk and manage them in one place, by the way?). I'm concerned that we're going to get blocked as we have other schools on the same IP address and I have no control what they do. Any thoughts?"

I became interested in coding Processing to work with the Kinect, but soon became disheartened when it appeared that bone data (or joint positions) were not readily available, instead only 3D depth data (cool but not enough) was readable. Then I found the OpenNI drivers (see links below) and the OSC server from Sensebloom. They were able to send joint data encoded as OSC commands to Processing, and I wrote up my own little Processing receiver to test it. It worked so well, I delved into their C++ code to see if I could send the same data to Scratch. When I couldn’t see a way for Scratch to interpret the OSC code, I read about the remote sensing over the network that Scratch allows. This was perfect; I could send Scratch commands from a C program which was reading joint data from the Kinect. So after making a few Scratch proof-of-concept games to test it, I decided to release it all for you guys to test out. You will need: A standalone Kinect (one bought without a console) OR a Kinect that came in a console bundle and the separately available USB plug to connect it to your PC A Windows PC (other versions can be made by coders familiar with coding on OSX or Linux) The OpenNI.org drivers installed The OpenNI2Scratch program Scratch Some Kinect aware Scratch programs. Here are a few: Skeleton, Ball Bounce and Space Invaders (Links to all of these are available on the tumblr page mentioned above) Once you’ve set that up, you have to connect the Kinect to your PC and wait for the drivers to install. Then run the OpenNI2Scratch program. Run Scratch, execute the Scratch program you want to control. Calibrate the Kinect - this involves standing a fair bit back from it and standing in a ‘calibration pose’ for a few seconds - see picture on site. Once the program has detected you, it will send the joint positions to Scratch. After that, see the variables on the sample Scratch programs to see how to use the joint data. Enjoy. Stephen Howell"

Thank you for sharing. I teach a middle school Student Technology Leadership class. ""Your body as keyboard and mouse"", a UI project, lights my kids up. I'm trying to come up with a game concept, using Kinect for whole body interaction, that teaches addition and subtraction of positive and negative integers. What I keep running into is that treating the idea of positive and negative quantities ( debit and credit transactions in a bank account) is too abstracted. Movement, right/positive and left/negative, seems to be easier to grasp because it is spatial. Scratch2Kinect lends itself to this task. I thought I was going to have to work with FAAST."

Does anyone have any ""definitely avoid!"" or ""must-do"" suggestions??   Once we get through this, I'm sure we'll be better able to plan additional Scratch classes.   BUT,  I'd really like to avoid flat out novice disaster the first time through!    What could go wrong that I should be thinking about and planning for now?

Yes there are differences in what they may have produced but for enjoyment and learning still the same.

12940,Scratch 1 week summer class for middle schoolers,6/5/12 23:16,"Carol, Couple of things that have worked for me. 1) there are certain kids who ""get it"" quicker than others and when they finish early these kid can be used to help/teach others. Also, it doesn't always have to the ones who ""get it"" quicker, its especially gratifying if you can find one child of low self-esteem and find a way that they can teach other kids something new.  It is great when you can have the kids be the teachers.   The guiding principle I try (and often fail) to use is let the kids be the teachers.  This has its limits and you can't expect kids to learn everything themselves, but there are opportunities for it to happen and ideally you can help orchestrate it happening. 2) During my classes many kids will be working independently on different parts of their project and I need a way to get their attention when one of them does something ""cool"" that I want to point out (and name the behavior idea) for the rest of the class.  I generally hate to yell to get their attention, so I developed a technique where I simply clap (in some short rhythm).  At firs tthe kids may look then ignore it, but I repeat (NOT saying a word) until all the kids look at me and start to repeat the clap. I will visually (and in some cases verbally with as few words as possible) encourage them to repeat my rhthym.  They usually get it and when they repat I tell them what a great thing did and tell them why it was great and name the powerful idea. 3) At the beginning of a set of ""classes"" I will encourage them to make mistakes.  I think the culture of the class plays a very important role in learning.  One of the first things I do when teaching (school or sports) a new group of kids is to encourage them to make mistakes and how to handle them.  A couple of phrases I use are: If you aren't making mistakes, you aren't trying hard enough. Congratulations you made a mistake, now what can we learn from it? Learn from the mistakes of others, you don't have enough time to make them all yourself. I also tend to model mistake making (sometimes intentionally :) In dealing mistakes I use the bathroom analogy (stolen from PCA,  nytimes article here, on flushing mistakes and filling their emotional tanks, which is equally important). 4) I sometimes find kids doing something completly different from what I had intended.  In my bad moments I will try and correct them.  I had one kid who was laughing histically and doing something related to the task at hand, but far from the intended task.  At first I tried to ""nudge"" him back on task. This was a mistake, which I fortunately realized quickly and the kid fortunatly ignored me and did what was fun and motivating for him (and he was learning and doing cool new things which the other kids saw)."
12940,Scratch 1 week summer class for middle schoolers,6/7/12 22:49,"Hi Stephen, Thanks for your ideas, especially the point about making mistakes.  VERY important, but I hadn't thought about explicitly teaching that.  We will now! Carol"

I have used most features - except the video camera stuff. I teach programming to 6th graders and I can see Scratch 2.0 will be an excellent tool. The Make your own block was essential and it is finally here. I used to use Logo just for the Procedures/ defines and now I can stay with Scratch for the entire year. I will even be able to teach a little on recursion. BTW a longer recursion crashed - not sure if this is something that will be fixed later - a graceful exit perhaps for programs that have bugs/take too many resources? The Make block parameters is very nicely done, though not as obvious with different shapes for different data types. Also if you delete the block define by dragging it off by mistake, it does not come back! Love the cloning feature but needs some explanation. I was not sure what code must go into Clone startup and what can go into the main loop. A best practices lesson on this is important. Did you remove the commenting feature - my students do not write comments but am hoping they will one day! I hope that you will provide a class account - a local community so my students can safely share their early projects within a class but not the entire community. I am very excited about the vector graphics. My students have used Inkscape, open source vector graphics software and now they can create directly in Scratch. Vector graphics have a clear math connection and can be an integral part of the lesson, not just as a way to create graphics. I would like a way for you to add copyright/acknowledge images to a project - make students aware of what they get from Google images is not necessarily free and ok to use!   Thank you for Scratch 2.0 , it will be a big hit next school year...."

I'm hoping this is solid as I am planning for Scratch in the second semester. I just thought I'd advocate for web-based app only schools. We're really couting on this for the new year. Scratch on!"
14083,Scratch 2.0 on Chromebooks,9/27/12 22:08,"Hi, Peter. Yep, we're certainly working furiously and hoping to launch by the end of the year. But it's hard to predict how smoothly it will go. You'd be wise to have a backup plan in case the release is delayed. Are you an alpha tester? If not, would you like to become one? That would give you a chance to see how well Scratch 2.0 runs on a Chromebook. It should work well, since it works well in the Chrome browser, but we don't have any ChromeBooks to test it on.

12295,Scratch 2.0 Preview,3/30/12 13:31,"I just watched the recoding of the webinar, and I was really impressed with the preview! Thanks a lot for all the work that went/will go into this! The new feature that I like most is parameterized blocks; I always found it a bit embarassing that Scratch was lagging behind good old LOGO in this respect. This new feature will make teaching Scratch simpler for me, since I'm  always trying to make the point that a large task should be subdivided into many small ones. In Scratch 1.4 this procedural programming approach was not really supported. One question  though: can custom blocks be shared among sprites? For example, if I need two sprites to jump, do I need to copy the definition of the jump block?"
12295,Scratch 2.0 Preview,3/30/12 15:36,"Hi Bernd, Currently, custom blocks will only be for the sprite you create them under. However, once you define a block,  you could copy the procedure into your ""backpack"" to be used in another sprite or project. M"

8405,Scratch 2.0 Suggestions,11/18/10 17:16,"Indroduction to the concept of object instances. This is useful both in the educational sense as well as the practical one. For instance, when creating a ""Pong"" game with blocks- one would want to create a single ""block"" object, which can receive x and y location parameters. One would then create several identical ""block"" instances, with the same appearance and bahaviour, only different location on the screen. Thanks!"
8405,Scratch 2.0 Suggestions,11/18/10 18:04,"I'd love to see improved connection to the outside world. The ScratchBoard is a great start - but it would be nice to have connectivity to some of the established microcontroller families; PICAXE, Arduino, (mbed?).... Kids would would benefit hugely from the ability to engage with not only programming but hardware hacking as well - and all of these hardware families (Arduino especially) would be far more accessible if they had a Scratch programming interface. I can see that trying to implement all of the many (different) features of these hardware families would be many steps too far - but perhaps the ability to programme simple control sequences and respond to even just digital sensors (analogue would be nice too) would be a start. Once someone has been introduced through Scratch to one of these processors, and hooked on hardware hacking, they would have the motivation to jump to the native languages for these processors...."

As outlined in Agnes Chang's paper, a synchronous version of Scratch where the stage is shared, but people can work on sprites independently. Plus a chat window, etc. Probably not for v2, but in my opinion, a holy grail feature for the future. Can you imagine, three or four kids from different parts of the world working on a Scratch project sychronously? It kind of blows my mind thinking about it. Anyway, I know I'm going to love Scratch 2.0. Scratch is is the most fun I've had with a computer since....I owned an Amiga! Peter R."

8405,Scratch 2.0 Suggestions,12/3/10 9:41,"First of all, I'd like to reiterate Hadas' request concerning object instances.  It is annoying to make so many copies of a sprite when you want to have them all behave the same way, just in different locations. Also, it'd be great to have an easy way to create ""walls"" or ""floors"" - something that all typical sprites cannot pass through.  Perhaps this could be a stage-only function, where you highlight certain areas (or select all areas of a certain color on the stage) and click a button, designating it as a no-pass-thru zone. One thing that should not change, however - is the stability.  I have NEVER had Scratch 'crash'.  Microsoft's PowerPoint (on my Mac) is much less stable than Scratch.  I tried ""Alice"" on the Mac - crash city! Scratch is very well designed.  Keep it up!"
8405,Scratch 2.0 Suggestions,12/2/10 15:39,"Amiga LOL I worked at a computer store about 15 years ago that had some Amigas they never moved out... We kept them on display though.  MAN could they run a good ""Dragon's Lair""!"
8405,Scratch 2.0 Suggestions,12/4/10 17:05,"Here are some points which I think are important: 1. Commitment by installation: From the science of persuation, we know that people tend to act in consistency with their past actions and statements. Downloading and installing Scratch constitutes a clear commitment to use it, and the installed icons present a constant reminder. Visiting a website and running Scratch there does not create the same commitment, and does not leave the same kind of visible reminders. 2. Bad company: I told my 13 year old son, proficient in Scratch, that in the future it would run in his web browser. He replied ""You mean like those bad internet games?"". Scratch risks to be associated with a lot of simple and low-quality games that are out there. 3. System requirements: I have obtained a collection of old laptops that have become obsolete at my workpace, for use in promotion of Scratch. The laptops have more than sufficient performance for Scratch in its current version, and even have proper tall screens. (I often tell this one-line joke: ""'How wide would you like your screen to be?', asked the man with the chainsaw."") The local school has a good collection of even older computers. If performance requirements increase with the new version then it may not be possible to run Scratch on machines that run it today. 4. Documentation and translation: All Scratch documentation, and translations thereof, must be laboriously upgraded when the user interface changes. This should only be done for good reason, obviously. Considering these points, my suggestion would be to make the browser version of Scratch more or less exactly the same as the free-standing application, and to continue to provide an installation file. Obviously there is a need to also run Scratch on offline computers, so I assume that this is being taken care of. A suggestion was made earlier is to make language expansions available through a level setting. This appears to me as a good way to expand Scratch while also keeping what we already have, which is very good. Torbjorn S"
8405,Scratch 2.0 Suggestions,12/30/10 3:44,"Along with the new text formating and layout features, I would love to see  some sort of simple math type functionality.  As a math teacher,  the ability to write mathematical formulas in Scratch would greatly increase the the value of Scratch in the math classroom.  For instance,  I have been developing a math game in Scratch with my students for them to both learn and practice math concepts: http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/webstermath/1436268 We are limited, however, by our inablity to express concepts like fractions, square roots and exponents in an easily readable manner. A math type could be added to Scratch in many possible ways.  If Scratch 2.0 has some sort of text box feature, then one possible solution would be to include a simple form of LaTeX.  I began witing a text box program with LaTeX features already: http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/webstermath/1508149 Unfortunately,  the project above runs really slowly online and capatalize every letter as it seem the java applet is not case sensitive.  Furthermore, without recursion, it will be nearly impossible to allow imbedded uses of LaTeX such as a fraction containing numbers with exponents.

8405,Scratch 2.0 Suggestions,12/20/11 13:39,"I'd like a way to restrict what blocks are available, or how many of each can be used. I see a couple of uses for this: 1. As a teacher, I have a certain order that I want to present concepts in. It'd be nice if I could hide all the extra stuff, so it's easier to focus on what we're learning. I could un-hide more and more blocks as we progress, until finally we're at the full Scratch interface. 2. I often give challenges to my students that have a restriction on how many blocks they can use. Do a certain task with only a single green-flag-clicked block. Do something else without any while loops. Stuff like that. Being able to restrict the number of blocks used would make this sort of challenge easier to implement."

12563,Scratch 2.0 Update: Website Development,4/26/12 20:01,"From the Scratch Team blog: Scratch 2.0 is a collaboration, with different people working on different parts of the same project. Most of the Scratch Team's time and effort is spent thinking carefully about how to make Scratch 2.0 easy and intuitive for people who are new to programming. Developers help turn those ideas into working code. The movie below is a visualization that shows how one part of Scratch 2.0 - the website code - has grown and changed as we work on it. Each dot represents a file that's part of Scratch 2.0. The figures that dart in and out, making changes to existing files and adding new ones, are the developers. As you'll see, Champika Fernando, the lead developer of the Scratch 2.0 website, has changed a lot of files, along with John Maloney and Sayamindu Dasgupta. And of course, the entire Scratch Team has been thinking carefully about the design of things (something which this visualization does not show). Lots of Scratchers have been asking us when Scratch 2.0 will be ready. It's still too soon to name an exact date, but we're planning to launch Scratch 2.0 later this year. As soon as we have a timetable for release, we’ll post an announcement."

This, however will only work if someone from the area stands up and takes the lead. A lot of Europeans truly enjoyed the Barcelona conference and if a lot of people are in favour of another European edition I'm totally happy to take the lead. Another Citilab edition will benefit largely from the experience in 2013 and is a good option (I love the place!) Reaching out to Eastern parts of Europe is also a good idea.

Of course I would love to go to Berkeley CA, but it might be to expensive. Berlin is another fantastic town, but Citilab might be even better. I really want to go to Barcelona (why not 5 days ?:) it's all about collaboration and socialisation). Keep up the good work with bringing Scratchconference to Europe."
28696,Scratch 2015 conference,8/10/14 15:37,I agree that Barcelona was an amazing venue! I saw some mention of Tokyo on Twitter and thought that was a wonderful idea as well!

How do we go about chosing a venue (a country)?  Does someone just volunteer a venue and what does the venue have to provide in terms of rooms, exhibitions halls, IT infrastructure...?  Is is expected that the venue be offered free of charge? Sorry for the questions.  You can tell I'm a detail-oriented person. :) ~Vivian"

Although we think it'd be more interesting to spread the Scratch movement to other locations, we'll be happy to offer the Citilab to host the Scratch Conference again, if needed. The Citilab has a commitment with the Scratch family, and it will we a pleasure for us to help organize the Scratch Conference 2015."

Once again, you better share your thoughts here as it's not me who takes decisions I can take a decision like scratch2013bcn, but so can you emails to me don't work for community building scratch2013bcn was a community effort, see the organizers page scratch2013bcn depended strongly on private persons making donations (and for sure I don't want to ask these people again) I think on the possibillity of a conference daily. Was thinking of doing an opne invitation for organizers meeting in Amsterdam mid november or in Berlin during Wipsce 5-7  november. But first I want to have sponsorships for approx $25000, so I'm sure we can do without a deficit. I applied for Google RISE funding, pray your buddha. As for places I reduced my options to Barcelona, Amsterdam and Berlin. You need to know the town a little (and have strong local partners) to set up a conference in a friendly afforable sphere (i.e. oppostite of venet organizers / conference center kind of meeting). Once again, other cities may equally qualify but should bring their own lead organizer. There's no rule that says next conference is in Europe. There will be Asian Scratcher Forum at 8 November, Korea (info?) If the people present there manage to form a team for an Asian Scratch Conference next summer I'll happily postpone European initiative to 2017. Same goes for a Snap-Invites-Scratch-Fest on US west coast. Please make some noise here so people can see it's worth their time to start organizing. Joek"

We need external funding of € 25.000 That's dirt cheap if you remember what scratch2013bcn.org brought us for this kind of money. My experience learned me that most people prefer to spend their money on other things. E.g. yesterday I received a ""no"" from Google RISE Awards. If we don't secure funding before mid January I want to cancel the project (or hand over to someone else wanting to take the risk). I've funds to organize one preparation meeting.

25169,Scratch accounts for classroom use,2/12/14 14:21,"I recommend letting kids create their own username and email (if they have one), especially if you think anyone might want to use Scratch outside of class. If they are under age 13, educators might have students use the teacher's email or set up a class email to use. I've heard educators say that they prefer having students use the teacher's email because any notifications of inappropriate content will be sent to the email on file for the account. Another option is to have young students create profiles at home with a parent or guardian providing an email. This could be assigned for homework with a letter home about Scratch and a place to fill in the chosen username and password -- so teachers can keep a master list on hand just in case a student forgets their account info. NOTE: The MIT Scratch Team is developing ""educator accounts"" to help educators create and manage student/class acounts. They plan to release this feature later this year. Hope that helps! I'd love to hear other ideas. Michelle Chung, on behalf of the ScratchEd Team"

I think that rolling out Scratch accounts per class may be a little daunting from a child protection/internet safety perspective. I would want to have some element of control as to what my students 'share' with the rest of the world. I do hope that the educator's accounts do allow us to make a more 'closed-off' community whereby only specific members can view and comment, Ben Matthews"
25169,Scratch accounts for classroom use,3/19/14 15:37,"I look forward to having a Classroom Management system.  In the interim I created separate accounts and passwords for each of my students in grades 4 - 6. The usernames included the school initials, the grade level, and the students initials.(For example: GS4TM )  I typed the usernames and passwords that I created for students  into a google spreadsheet that we often refer to. I used my email address for all of the accounts. This account is for projects that we are doing in class. Some students have their own personal account for Scratch that they've set up with their families."

25169,Scratch accounts for classroom use,3/21/14 20:17,"Sandy, I logged into each of the students accounts  and created a 'placeholder project' with the project title and the students initials.

When I go to the studios I see all of the projects from that grade level . I haven't figured out a way to monitor the comments without clicking on each one of them.

Gmail - conveniently - ignores anything after a + For instance an email sent to me@gmail.com, me+student1@gmail.com, me+student2@gmail.com show up in me's inbox. Of course you will have to create an account in Scratch for each of your students. The students, on the other hand, will not be needing their own personal email accounts. You can further 'filter' your emails and direct them to folders set up as Student1, Student2, Student3, etc. I hope I didn't miss the mark on this post.

All of my students know how to save a file to their documents and retrieve them. It eliminates having to use a third party application. It would be nice if it was easy to create student accounts but I can't have each child have to use their parents' personal email account and then wait for parents to respond. I don't have to do that for any other subscription we have. Instead of a studio on the Scratch website, students will have a Scratch files folder on our network.

We understand your frustration with the registration process for students, and we’re sorry for the difficulties that it has caused for you and your students. We’re continuing to work on Teacher Accounts, which we hope will simplify the process of creating accounts for your students. Unfortunately, the development of the Teacher Accounts has taken much longer than we expected. We hope to have more news about the accounts soon. We’ll make sure to post messages on ScratchEd to keep you informed. In the meantime, we suggest using a single email address (e.g., a teacher’s email address) to register and approve all of your student accounts. (Multiple Scratch accounts can share the same address.) We realize that the confirmation process can be time-consuming for educators, but confirmation is just a one-time process when first registering an account. Sorry again for the current difficulties. We hope to have better solutions in the future. Please do feel free to reach out to me should you have more questions. Thanks!"

We have started a monthly Skype meeting to share ideas, successes, new agenda items, and build a common connection.   Everyone is invited to join. There is no pressure to actively participate you can just come and listen. This is Vicki Gold Computer Science teacher from Marshfield High school, and if any of you know me in the past I have had a very hard time introducing Scratch into my school.  I am happy to say this year, I have had some successes. This year we have a new Superintendent. He sends out weekly communications to the school district which includes a link of educational interest. I was able to include the scratch and scratched links to one week’s posting. In addition, there was an  mistake in the links, so Scratch was listed in two successive issues. I now have a physics teacher very interested making a Scratch Einstein game, and younger students wanting to create projects with children from other countries.  Later in the year the Special Education Department and I will apply for a grant to write an amazing app for android tablets. The application will be able to be customized by the students using app_inventor. I have a group of young talented programmers waiting in the background jumping for the chance to start. In my class I have been able to introduce the new Alice beta into my OO class. It is very good, and the students love 3D. Later in the year we will be using Scratch when we begin our Asteroid game. I know this is just a start of what the group envisions, but after five years of fighting I am very happy  with these small steps.

Looking online, it is hard to tell which is the best value and the easiest to interface with app-inventor. In addition, many grants are available. Any suggestions on which grant would be most interested in involving tablets, app_inventor/scratch, and special ed kids. At this time, I cannot pin down the amount of money the project will need. In addition to the hardware, we will need to pay the ABA/SPED person for his great app idea.  Personally, in the design I am more excited that the kids will get to customize the app for personal expression, fun and for their own needs. All suggestions are appreciated. Thanks, Vicki Gold"

34136,Scratch and creativity attitudinal assessment,5/5/15 22:38,"I have a particular interest in helping kids see computers as creative tools.  So, as part of the kickoff of a Scratch unit I'm helping my 5th-grade child's teachers deliver, we gave the 44 5th-graders a brief attitudinal survey as a pre-assessment.  The survey asked about their prior experience with Scratch, then asked them to what degree they agreed with the statements ""I can use computers to make things"" and ""I could be a computer programmer."" Of the kids who reported that they had ""a lot"" of prior experience with Scratch, 92% ""definitely"" agreed with the statement ""I can use computers to make things.""  Only 13% of the kids who reported no or little prior experience with Scratch felt this way.  (More data at http://www.jasoninnes.com/?p=150) Of course, we can't say that Scratch caused the kids to feel this way.  But in the minds of these 5th graders at least Scratch is strongly associated with a view of computers as creative tools.  This finding really made me happy and I just thought I'd share! Does anyone have any experience with or pointers to attitudinal surveys or other instruments specifically designed to gauge kids' feelings about creativity and computers?  (We will be conducting more assessments -- at least a final post-assessment -- so we could definitely use some ideas for improvements to the surveys.)"

910,Scratch and Lego,9/22/09 23:19,"Hi, has anyone created a curriculum that involves Lego's WeDo set with Scratch? Any possibilities of creating a curriculum out of this combination?"
910,Scratch and Lego,9/23/09 13:35,"I just introduced WeDo into our 5th grade classes for thier Simple Machines unit. Beyond that, I'm looking to find other ways to get the kits into curriculum."
910,Scratch and Lego,9/23/09 21:00,Are 5th Graders 11 year-olds? Are you using the WeDo software or Scratch?
910,Scratch and Lego,10/30/09 10:22,"I teach classes at a local museum using PicoBlocks along with the WeDo. PicoBlocks is a version of Scratch written specifically to interface the WeDo system along with the PicoCricket system. I have done both single day/ 3 hour classes and week long/ 4hour per day classes. So I have not established any set curriculum, especially that would apply to a long term class session however I would be happy to provide any help if desired. zac_ray@fastmail.fm I also have a Scratch projects gallery, some of which I have used in my classroom here."
910,Scratch and Lego,1/4/10 17:12,"Hello, I realize this is an older thread, but maybe folks will see it. Using the WeDo with Scratch 1.4 I have been very impressed with the control of the motors. Works quickly and well. However, the distance and tilt sensors are just awful. I've purchased a second one of each just to make sure I didn't have a dud, and they are both just as bad. Has anyone had better luck with controlling this using Scratch?"
910,Scratch and Lego,1/4/10 19:38,"When I first started experimenting with WeDo, I found the tilt sensor pretty unsatisfying. I was expecting something more like an accelerometer. :)  I adjusted my expectations -- so I'm more realistic about what I think I'm able to build with it. The distance sensor has been fine for me. (Or, at least, been enough for what I've been trying to build.) What sorts of things are you trying to do with the distance and tilt sensors that make them less-than-optimal?"
910,Scratch and Lego,1/4/10 22:57,"Hey Karen, For example, the distance sensor at 11cm from a wall might read ""20"". At 12 cm from the wall it read ""2"". At 15cm from the wall it reads ""74"". The tilt sensor seems about as accurate. Project example, just putting the tilt sensor on a large lego block. When it is tilted in direction ""1"" a sound would play. Direction ""2"" would play a different sound. Etc.  Idea was to make an instrument and then build on that. Trouble is that the direction the sensor is tilted seems to have no relation to its numerical output. Even in slow motion. Kids lost interest, which in my book gives Lego an F for these sensors. I'm sorry if I sound like I'm whining. The motor control in Scratch is wonderful. But so far I have found the tilt and distance sensors to be very disappointing."
910,Scratch and Lego,1/5/10 10:42,I don't think you're whining. :) Thanks for the examples. I agree that it's frustrating if kids are losing interest!

Cheers, Dennis"
910,Scratch and Lego,5/24/12 8:20,I'm curious - are the problems only when used with Scratch or also with the WeDo software?
910,Scratch and Lego,1/3/14 2:53,"I've been using WeDo, with the Activity Pack, as the main part of a middle-school Robotics elective. (http://www.elginisd.net/webpages/friedag/legorobotics.cfm?subpage=1322098) If kids advance through all the projects quickly and successfully enough, I usually let them ""graduate"" to the NXT kits. But I've also been introducing some kids to the Scratch-with-WeDo option, and it's equally engaging, especially when they are also given the WeDo Extension sets (with additional building ideas). Last year, for a local Mini Maker Faire, I challenged my Robotics Club (http://www.elginisd.net/webpages/friedag/elginbricks.cfm) to build ""circus rides"" (inspired by the ferris wheel project in the extension set), while programming with Scratch. They got very creative, using the Scratch on-screen interface to add music, visual effects, and ""customer"" interactions, and using the WeDo sensors to control the speed of the rides and/or visual effects, or to count out rotations as a method of timing the ride duration. If I had time to work on an ""open"" (free) Scratch-plus-WeDo curriculum, I'd start by mimicing/adapting the LEGO Education WeDo Activity Pack, and also adapt/borrow ideas from http://www.wedobots.com/ and http://www.damienkee.com/lego-wedo-coral-reef/. The main work needed would be coming up with all the sample programs, including the block-by-block explanations. But note also that LEGO Education did a good setting up a kid-stimulating storyline (with videos & graphics) for each of the Activity Pack projects. I think that this kind of thematic play is a key part of LEGO's concept of the WeDo system, and I think it would be key to making any WeDo+Scratch initiative into a ""hit""."
39806,Scratch and Lego WeDo 2.0,1/21/16 10:31,I actually have 2 questions. 1) Is the new Lego WeDo 2.0 set compatible with Scratch? I was recently awarded a grant to order Lego WeDo bots for my elementary technology classes and need to know if I should order the original WeDo kits or the newer 2.0. 2) Is it possible to use a Chromebook to use Scratch with Lego WeDo? I have a few Windows run laptops but I have a class set of Chromebooks and it would be easier to use those if at all possible. Thanks in advance.

Generally, I'm impressed with WeDo 2.0.  Lots of very useful parts, easy connection, and some good projects. I haven't yet worked with students on WeDo 2.0 but it looks like it is open-ended enough to invite improvisation and not just rote replication of pre-existing projects.

Since we rely on the on-line access - it would have been a much bigger problem if this had happened during our class time in which we only have 40 mintues of seat time.  The ability to access the Scratch Program from any computer in the school is well worth the risk, however.  Without the on-line version we would not be able to offer this class.

9385,Scratch Cards,3/25/11 21:08,"We would love to post them on Scratch! but could we do it on the open community - or both - but not just ScratchEd? Our idea is that people could leave comments so the cards could be improved as time went on or even remixed. So far we have a template and about 6. We are sharing them in our class this week and then after we proof them, we could post the first group. Here is a link to a first draft of one: https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=1xjPjPEQ1TCp4UXuugvtTmbdKi45B0Ax0QdHb1oqFrdw Let me know if this link doesn't work. We have also taken a screencast of the script on the card - not the whole project. Here is our dilemma: 1. We'd like to post the cards. 2. We'd like to post the .mov files and have the cards be clickable to see the .mov 3. We'd like users to be able to leave comments about the cards 4. We'd like to be able to share remixed cards. What do you think? All ideas are welcomed! We started today trying to figure out how to post a .mov uploaded to a Google Doc on our class ""Site"" BUT we'd like to open this to the whole Scratch community and hope others would like to ""trade cards"""

9385,Scratch Cards,3/27/11 11:13,"How can we start a blog that would be easily linked or available to the whole Scratch community? Is there anyone else doing anything similar? I wonder if it would be better to post them somehow as little scratch projects, put the link to a pdf in the project notes and put all these little projects in a gallery? There must be other ideas being shared with the whole community. How did Scratch resources start?"
9385,Scratch Cards,3/27/11 12:01,"All of the infrastructure for posting them as Scratch projects is already there, so that's pretty easy. As for a blog linked to the whole Scratch community, the linking part is easy. Creating the blog with all of the content is the labor-intensive part. :) Do you have access to blogging platforms through your district? Free services like WordPress could work as well."

14889,Scratch conference 2013 in Amsterdam?,11/7/12 18:13,"Update 23 december 2012: ""Amsterdam?"" should be read as ""Barcelona!"" as explained in my comment of december 23rd. Dear European Scratchers present at ScratchMIT2012 , dear Scratch team, dear others who I think want to hear about this, At ScratchMIT2012 it was suggested to ""use"" the odd years for Scarcth conferences outside MIT, that is on other continents with the suggestion of Barcelona  for 2013. With this mail I want to quickly check out if there's enough interest to start the dirty work. I'll explain why I'm interested in it and will end with a short questonniaire. People attending at ScratchMIT2012 are roughly in one of three categories Scratch professionals People doing amazing stuff with Scratch they want to share People ""just"" doing amazing things with Scratch who are curious to meet others engaged with Scratch It's for this third category that I want to bring the conference to Europe. Like the teachers and librarians form East Coast US find it affordable to visit Cambridge, the same kind of people from European countries may find a European conference ""worth a detour"". I realize that they are also  attracted by the presenters mentioned as 1 and 2. Last three months I tried to work things out with Frank Sabaté, Jordi Freixenet, Eduard Muntaner and Teresa Ferrer, the  Catalans present at ScratchMIT2012. It turned out that pretty soon there was a date, a venue and ... then things came to a halt as no funding was guaranteed. Talks with Barcelona government showed that they like to co-operate but not on the short term of less then one year. My two reasons in favor of Barcelona were the strong local Scratch community (see http://scratchcatala.com) and the fact that partnering with others makes the effort much more doable. Now Barcelona isn't an option anymore I rethought on a conference in The Netherlands andI like to do it. More precisely I'm prepared for 100s of hours of work, beginning with getting commitment from you (this mail) and local organizations. I just noticed that this weekend the Scarcth team is residing in London, UK see  http://lanyrd.com/2012/mozilla-festival/  I'm happy to come over and start working on this 2013 conference idea. Sundaynight, monday or whatever suits better. The questions I would want your ""first thought"" answer on are: Do you consider spending some days at ScracthAMS2013? Do you like to present something on this conference? Can you be of help organizing this conference (funding, communications, commitee, ...)? Looking forward hearing from you.

They show that once again there is strong interest to come together and share our adventures with Scratch. I spoke with Mitch Resnick at Mozilla Festival London. He wants me to secure a venue and some funding before going public with a date. I followed his advice to check with Karen Brennan about what to expect when organizing such a thing: lots of hours and something with funding :-) Karen told me about the Costa Rican Scratch conference in 2011, which means this odd-years-scratch-conference-outside-US is close to getting a tradition. In the mean time, Citilab of Barcelona is still happy to host the conference ... So Amsterdam may turn out to be Barcelona. Let's see if some competition between these two nice cities speed up things. In Amsterdam I secured a school built by the famous school architect Hertzberger. My first funding requests at Amsterdam Municipality and Dutch Education Department focus on getting assistance to get European funding. Europe likes us to co-operate especially if they think it's good for competing with the other powers in the world (which are invited to join). Once again, you're reactions keep me going, so keep sharing your thoughts. Thank you."

We definitely need to decide on date and venue soon. The Citylab is tempting but as I don't have local support for all the preparations (unlike my hometown, where I can mobilize some) I'm still not sure. Your opinion on this is appreciated. Early january, e.g. 11-13 weekend, I want to host a meeting where 4-6 people come together to set up the frame work for organizing.

And just curious how many people have registered so far and how many are expected total?  And in which languages will sessions be held.  I can do Spanish and English, but I'm fairly limited in other languages.  Will interpreters be available?"

So apart from your hotel you need something like € 9,80 for 10 rides on the public transport, meals or snacks in the evenening will be something like € 15 each. Most bars in Barcelona serve small sandwiches which cost you something like € 1,50 each. We're close to 200 people registered. I wouldn't mind if it goes up to 250 or sells out at 320. Conference language is English. People are free to use the self organized sessions for meetings in any language. We don't have translation services."

Over all, I am very pleased with the organization of the unit and how easily most of it is going into the unit. As far as I know, this is going to be the first programming unit, in our state, developed for middle schools to use as a blended course. If I can adapt the course to our state's online course standards, it could become available state-wide. So, again, I want to give my congrats to the ScratchEd Team - excellent work!

My middle school students meet for 40 minutes, three times weekly. I am finding that we need to spend a little more time on each session than I originally thought that we would-the students are interested in creating very ambitious projects already! We are using the resource cards, Susan's youtube channel, and projects from the Web site for guidance. I have been videotaping their sessions and then playing the films back to the other classes so different grades can view the projects being created in other classes. This is one way they are learning from each other and collaborating, even thouugh they may not all be meeting face-to-face. I also pull up specific projects in progress from other classes so students can see the scripts, etc. that other students are working out. The students in class are encouraged to travel around the room to offer help and view others' projects also. The reflection questions are something I really appreciate about this curriculum, and the maintenance of the design notebook. We usually close reflection time with a discussion/sharing session. My students struggled with the idea of sketching the arts- themed project. This was a good thing:They produced some great ideas! I had planned to integrate portions of the Calder curriculum into my plans with this, but so far I am sticking to the draft as written, and the students are learning so much with it. Thank you for providing this!"

We finished our Dance Parties but that made us want to spend some time on audio editing so we took a little sidetrack and we're making the interactive bands which everyone is loving! We have one more week to complete the bands and then a break for Presidents Week and then we're back. We'd love to share. Anyone up for a Skype conference? We had fun with Ms. Pickett's class! Anyone doing anything similar with audio and Scratch?

10945,Scratch Curriculum Guide Draft Feedback,2/17/12 10:46,"Our school uses Cornell Notes. So I have completed a Cornell Notes template for each ""Module"", (Intro, Arts, etc.). As we have shorter periods, I have had to limit the responses to one note taking per module. I have put all of the design questions and the vocabulary, (Cornell Notes calls them key words), on each template. So each student has to turn in the project for the module and then complete the notes. At the same time we are learning Scratch, students are learning to put their materials online in Blackboard, same ideas would apply to other online environments."

My students are thinking and learning, and I am so appreciative of the materials you have provided. The students are growing in self-confidence and many are getting turned on to computer science. My question is, will there be an extension of this curriculum guide? I have some ""eager beavers"" in 6th and 7th grade who want to keep delving more deeply with Scratch, and I have been so pleased with the implementation of this in our school that I want to continue challenging the students next year. I'm planning to introduce PICOboards as an extension, but am wondring if you could point me towards some additional curricular resources for teaching Scratch. Essentially, I am good at implementing, but not so great at creating my own materials :) Thanks for any feedback you can provide.-Betty P."
10945,Scratch Curriculum Guide Draft Feedback,3/6/12 15:29,"Thanks so much for the feedback! Currently, there isn't an extended version of the guide although there are hopes to develop strategies for this in the future. Exactly how to do this? We're not sure yet. Do you have any suggestions? For your 6th and 7th graders, I might suggest the Scratch Programming Challenges or Design Studio Activities that I could imagine being formatted for a classroom lesson plan. Every few weeks, the Scratch Team also posts a new Design Studio prompt on the Scratch website (see the 4th post on the right column), so if you are able to access the website, that might be a way to engage the students with a wider audience. If you're interested in physical computing like the PicoBoards, the LEGO WeDo Robotics Kit is another physical extension that works with Scratch. You could also look through the middle school resources on ScratchEd to see if there's anything of interest there. Hope that helps. Let us know how it goes! M"
10945,Scratch Curriculum Guide Draft Feedback,3/22/12 14:16,"Thanks so much for providing this outstanding curriculum guide to me and my students. We have had a few bumps along the way and I know you are interested in how this currculum is working out for students, so I thought I would share the few challenges we encountered: My groups have made it through to Session #12 so far. Things have gone extremely well until we attempted the Scrolling starter project. This one has proved the most challenging task for my students so far, and the one with which they have encountered the most difficulties. Many (6-8) students were not able to independently follow the the handout very well on their own, so I broke it down for them into sequential steps. The steps to creating the program were obvious to me, but they had a little trouble following the handout on their own, and envisioning the end result. I searched the Web site for some scrolling examples, which helped the students understand precisely what the goal of the project was and that helped them understand the four frames displayed at the top of the handout, as well as the other visuals on the handout. There was some confusion over the creation of the 2 sprites with identical costumes, and then some students incorrectly coded their scripts. These problems were easily solved. However, even when all scripts seemed perfectly written, the costumes duplicated exactly, etc..,   we found that on some programs, the scrolling was ""buggy."" On these buggy  programs,the students figured out  that the order in which the variables and operator blocks are added to the stage script impacts the operation of the program. The script can ""look"" correct but not be sequenced correctly, and this is not obvious to the students when visually scanning for errors. Having these students rebuild the last two blocks on the stage script precisely from left to right seems to solve the scrolling problem for most. With more experience with Scratch, I might have been better able to advise them on this issue, but I was equally stumped for a while trying to figure out why some programs scrolled perfectly and others did not... Again, thank you. The ""bumps"" are looked upon as learning opportunities and not frustrations. -BP"

The scrolling project can definitely be challenging although still popular, and I can see where the handout might be lacking in terms of trying to translate the process of scrolling.

10945,Scratch Curriculum Guide Draft Feedback,4/8/12 7:27,"Thank you for the great curriculum guide. I began a Project Based Inquiry Learning Project this semester with the 7th grade challenge class. Their final challenge was to create a video story or game that included Ecological principles we explored during the unit to be able to present to a panel as to further educate the younger generation. I took the curriculum guide and modified it a bit to be more of a self-paced packet. Can I say that it was great! The students who could move faster did so. They were required to complete all the different skill sets; however, I gave them the freedom to incorporate a few into one which they did with out me telling them. Their final projects are wonderful. In an effort to assist with the managing of the files, I use a free pbworks account where students could upload their works in progress and then post their final projects. This seemed to be a bit more focused arena for the students. Students viewed the other projects and collaborated online as well as did a gallery walk on the final day. They learned some valuable tools. I had MOST of my class staying daily to work on scratch. Additionally, I had others that weren't in my classes want to learn. Thank you for the incredible material that has really sparked learning for many!"
10945,Scratch Curriculum Guide Draft Feedback,4/8/12 15:26,Is there a public URL? I'd love to see your projects and I'm interested to know more about how you used the pbworks account for sharing works in progress.
10945,Scratch Curriculum Guide Draft Feedback,4/10/12 16:27,"I use Scratch as part of our middle school Innovation Lab design studio program. This curriculum document is a very useful tool and I greatly appreciate those who created it. Like many curriculum documents, however, I find it to be too much of a bottom up approach. I have found over the years that the non-intuitive approach of teaching top down works better in the development of creative and criticial thinking. That is, my students start by identifying a problem that they want to solve or a goal they want to achieve and then drill down to figure out what knowledge they need to learn and find or create the resources that they need. I found that if I introduce the features of Scratch from the bottom up that this limited the students' creativity. It locked them in to solutions that only used those features. I want them to learn to ask, ""What features do I need in this language and how can I create them,"" rather than, ""how can I build something on top of the features that I have been taught."" I am using the curriculum document starting from the end, with the final project, and then letting students identify features that they think they need, and knowledge that they need to learn. For instance, they figured out that they need to learn how an arrow flies through the air for a game they wanted to create so they first went off and taught themselves enough physics. When they figure out that they need to write a piece of a program that repeates a certain number of times or until some event happens, they go look up if that is possible in Scratch. This is how I did engineering for many years and I want the students to be innovators and the drivers who create new technologies."
10945,Scratch Curriculum Guide Draft Feedback,5/29/12 8:53,"I used Session #3 in my class with kids ages 10-16 When I first showed the ""Bosses"" the videos, the reaction was no way, this is going to be hard.  I must admit I had the same reaction.  I (and I think the kids) figured that the video with Mitch would be possible, but some of the later ones would be too challenging.  Well I was wrong (love when that happens, I learn something new :) The kids did great and were able to program each other in a relatively short time. One thing I changed from the Draft is I had the  bosses and bossed switch.  Show I would show the first video and A would program B, then I would have B program A.  So they all got an opportunity to see both sides. I asked the question, ""How is this like programming?""  Which is similar to ""How does this activity relate to Scratch?""   Below are some of the comments from the students: We didn't know what was in the mind of the programmer. We had no idea what they wanted us to do. We had no ""insight"" (Note: I also have them taking the Coursera CS101 course on their own in a ""flipped classroom"" type approach.  One of the early comments in the course was that the computer, unlike a human has know insight into what you mean). We can only use words. After class I realized one of the questions I should have asked is ""How is this NOT like programming?""  I will try this next time. For homework, I am having them create a ""Dance"" program, where they take pictures of themselves in different dance positions, ""green screen"" their bodies out of the pictures and then program each other to dance.  I am also using Scratch connect and Etoys so they can create a ""game controller"" in Etoys to control the Dancers and can have a dance party on one screen projected on the wall, each student controlling their own dancer using Etoys (via Remote Sensor Protocol).  Can't wait until Makey Makey comes out so I can try incorporating that. Note: I had a class before this where we did ""How to Train Your Robot""  using Dr. Techniko's hand out and having them program their parents.  Not sure how much this impacted how quickly/easily they were able to program each other. I really like your approach of having kids ""step away from the computer and no one gets hurt"" approach.  I try to do this a lot, partly so they can get in touch and reflect upon the knowledge they have in their own bodies and also to give them different context for experiening the same/similar concepts and ideas,"
10945,Scratch Curriculum Guide Draft Feedback,5/29/12 10:31,"Hi Stephen, Thanks for sharing your experiences! I love the idea of having the partners switch so they get a chance to experience what it's like to program and be programmed. :) I'd love to hear how the Dance programs turn out! M"
10945,Scratch Curriculum Guide Draft Feedback,6/24/12 22:22,"I taught Session 3 again to a different group of kids and noticed how some of the moves are symmetrical (especially in Dance1).  I pointed this out to the kids (tried to do so through questions) and asked how are these moves the same and different.  Which led to the realization that its the same basic move once with the right hand and once with the left hand.  This then lead to a short discussion on how we can have a common set of instructions used by different body parts/costumes/objects.  In a future version of the class I would like to try and point this out immediately after Dance 1 and see how many kids ""get the idea"" and use it for Dances 2 and 4. Dance 3 doesn't really lend itself to this idea. It would be nice if the third video also included ceratin moves like this so that I can use ""the same script"" with different body parts through all the Dances to help re-inforce this concept.  Of course, the videos are so well done (and the more I watch them I appreciate how well thought out) there may be a reason http://vimeo.com/28612800  does not have a similar pattern. One thing that I believe could be useful for teachers is a set of additional ""questions"" and/or short videos on ""how to use these sessions.""  That said you have to balance providing a quick to the point lesson plan for busy teachers with more in depth/additional materials.  Perhaps as an optional section or additional resources and ideas for each session in a way that is easy for teachers to find and use (ie: not just in discussion notes :)"
10945,Scratch Curriculum Guide Draft Feedback,1/30/13 11:45,"I have been using the Scratch Curriculum Guide for about one month now to advance my 6th graders' knowledge of Scratch.  I started my Scratch unit by having stduents complete the Scratch cards, the orange square purple circle project, a scratch design studio project of their own choosing, and a remix project.  I then had them start working on the Scratch Curriculum Guide projects.  I let the students work at their own pace since they all completed the scratch cards at different times. When I use the Scratch Curriculum Guide next time, I will have all of the students complete the same project on the same day.  I will also do the scratch design studio project and the remix after they have already completed the Scratch Curriculum Guide.  I will also add the space invaders project as a remix project and use the Scratch Diving Deeper Challenges to push their programming to the next level. I love giving my students a packet of projects to complete at their own pace, but I found that some students completed 10 projects in the time some of their classmastes created 2 or 3.  I would love to have them moving through the curriculum more as a group so they can collaborate, share their projects, give each other feedback, and discuss different methods for solving the same challenge."

10945,Scratch Curriculum Guide Draft Feedback,2/13/14 5:37,"Hi ScratchEd Team, First I want to thank you for this awesome work. Your curriculum has been a great help for me. I have used it as an inspiration to prepare my sessions, sometimes using it as-is, sometimes inventing my own activities. So I thought it was time to give feedback on what has worked well or not so well for me. It’s a lot of information that I tried to summarize, don’t hesitate to ask for more details if my point is not clear. In my sessions, I have 10 kids from 8 to 10 for an hour and a half every school week. We are are now getting to sessions 14. As a general rule, I have found that what works better is to show at the beginning of sessions examples of target projects to give them ideas of what they can do. The projects have to be simple enough that they will be able to do it, and generic enough that they leave room for personalization, personal creativity. I have sometimes used the curriculum project examples (for the art session #5 for example), or made/curated my own. It works better than trying to explain “how” to do things at the beginning of the sessions (a mistake I made at the beginning). Then I give them the paper handouts with project code example, and I explain “on demand” when they want to do something something and are wondering how. Examples that work well: -          Session #5 -          To invent stories creating their own sprites and background, I had this studio of examples : Session #4 and 5 were too much alike, kids had a repetition feeling, and were less motivated. Session #5 Art projects : I used your projects examples and handouts, and it worked great. Session #6 : I did not get the point of the 6-word story, so I did not try it. Instead, I replaced session 6 and 8  with a three sessions work on creating stories, that worked tremendously well: -          First workshop : I told kids that that would be creating a story but that they couldn’t use the image library in Scratch, and would have to create their own (drawing, drawing with scratch, modelling playdough, photographing persons and objects)  showed them examples I had created aor curated : http://scratch.mit.edu/studios/292530/ . I had kids pick up an image among 10 that made them feel like telling a story, creating groups with people having chosen the same image. Then they spent the sessions inventing the story and creating the sprites and background, and we took pictures. -          Second workshop : Work on notebook to remember the story outline. Import images in scratch and create project. A lot of time was spent in importing and clipping images, so one session was not enough to finish the project. -          Third workshop : finish project. Session #7 (Remix) was very valuable. For some kids, the second time changing computers was too much, and they dropped it. These were the less proficient kids. So next time might do only one swap. The session led to very interesting discussion with the kids on how you should save your work (some team made huge modification and previous versions were lost), on how it was great to enhance some one else program, and how hard it was to see your work modified. Session #9 debug and session #10 Maze: great. As I have an hour and a half, I mixed it with the maze, and I used a Makey Makey and big tinfoil arrows to play the maze, and this was a great session. #11 Maze extensions (variable) Works great, my only reserve is that the variable project example have different level of complexity, and it was harder for some kids as I distributed the projects randomly. Having the kid explain what they learn and show how they used it in their maze extension was very effective. #12 more games : I extended it on two sessions, as kids wanted to finish their projects. I used a leap motion for more fun on the collision project. The scrolling project is way too hard. I think I will replace it with a “change level when reaching  a door on the stage” kind of example. I will keep the scrolling example for older kids, or if a kid specifically asks for it. Design notebook : I have had difficulties in systematically use them.  I have been thinking of preparing specific design notebook with an entry for each session. Do you have best practices on how this topic? I would be very interested."

23940,Scratch Educator Meetup Breakout Session Notes: Life After Scratch,11/21/13 16:51,"Special thanks to LeeAnn Wells for sharing these notes taken during the ""Life After Scratch"" breakout session at the November 2013 Scratch Educator Meetup, held at MIT on November 2, 2013. Life After Scratch! After Scratch, or if students are getting a bit antsy with Scratch, what can we do? 1) Generative Art - Scratch has very advanced features for this! 2) Programming robotics using Scratch - a more “making” level - taking it out of the computer a) This can make everything even more collaborative 3) Rube Goldberg Machines - Elaborate cartoon machines (such as a machine for making toast) 4) Derek: Instructional Design - How to teach with Scratch 5) Block space programming is used in other applications as well. 6) Look at the more powerful aspects of Scratch in order to help students who are moving quickly through to require to reach! 7) Chris: Some students felt “too mature” for Scratch and had the notion that you couldn’t do much with it. Makey Makey: Then students were making mazes, etc., Multi-Level games with physical controllers - Students ended up making a game that they created with controls that they created. a.) Next: Paper Prototype of a controller Students know where they are and where they want to go. b) IDEO shopping cart video c) Film “Objectified” shows examples of Industrial Design d) Kevin Kelly book “What Technology Wants” “Virtually every technology that has been invented is still in use.” 8) Natalie - Advanced Kids Steve - Concrete Chris - Design Process - thinking outside of the box LeeAnn: Where are we going with Scratch and then…. 9) Hack a USB number pad to create a controller 10) Use Legos and Makey Makey to create a controller Break something down and build it back up again Students as hackers - modding 11) The Game “Portal” - Educational Version - Ships with tools - Students can create a maze that has gravity and friction - Portal is actually a nonviolent (shoot the wall, not people) modded version of Half-Life 2 12) Someone did create a Portal game in Scratch 13) If we look at things as a platform to be hacked, another dimension is opened. 14) God mode/Cheat codes are created to allow developers to get through to a level that they are working on! 15) Natalie: Robotics and other program suggestions are going 16) Snap: Developed at Berkley. Berkley built another layer on top of Scratch - Also runs on an Ipad. Has a full curriculum built around it at Berkley - Lectures are online. 17) Ipad Browser - Puffin - allows Scratch programs 18) How to EMBED a project within a website. a) Full screen is great to share with kids b) Vector Graphics - Scalable - Convert before creating sprites c) GoogleSites is great for this d) On Scratch project click “Share” e) Scroll down to “Share to” to see code f) Copy code g) go to Google Site h)  Insert code and click the “HTML” letters above right i) It will be converted to a gadget where you can go in and change things. j) Preview page as viewer k) You can go in and set the width at 100%. k) You can go in and set the width at 100%."

Project Ideas 1)  Project an object:  What do you see? 2) Scratch Cards – Checkoff  System a) See ScratchEd Discussion Thread – Derek has a long post there. b) Spreadsheet – Name at top – Complete activity and Checkoff c) *Kids can become experts on particular cards and teach others d) Kids can design their own cards that are not in there yet!  (Blocks are in, but cards are not) e) In the Scratch forums you can type in the block name and graphics come up for screencapture 3)  About Me Project - *Idea – don’t share names and have students guess! 4)  Younger – bring up a project and have them make changes 5)  Design Notebook in GoogleDocs is used for documentation a) Also, audio recording via a sprite within their project can be documentation b) Pointed questions for them to answer 6)  Help Ideas a) Try again b) Try again harder c) Help Engine within Scratch 2.0 d) Google It e) Ask a partner f) Name on board asking for help 7)  In the curriculum guides there are one pagers a) Print them in color b) Put them in Screen Protectors c) PDF them? d) Great for kids who are moving faster 8)  Ingrid’s rule is that she does NOT touch the mouse 9)  Kids can work in pairs – Most want to work independently 10)  Even the youngest should have a non identifying screen name so that they can 11)  Search Gmail Aliases (G+) off of one email 12)  Also, kids can hop on and NOT create any account – They just cannot save it 13)  Ingrid has kids working in the online environment 14)  Usernames – Add them to ONE STUDIO as CURATORS – they can add projects to the studio 15)  After the enrichment program is over – can change the email account that it is connected to 16)  Math night – Use scratch to explain the project (which explains the math within a project) 17)  1st year Ingrid had 8 participants – Next year 35 kids – PR Math connection 18)  Debug Its – Use them and have them make up their own. a) Also – Debug with cards – 7 cards such as “fix this” or “why is the score not working” etc. 19)  Sprites from a Webcam – Stop Animation – Several Costumes 20)  Shared Aquarium Project – Every kids make a fish to go in one aquarium project 21)  Biofeedback – Creature needs to find it’s food – sniff – as it gets closer to the food the behavior changes.  You need to decide what to do with the feedback. 22)  Real World Rollercoaster in Scratch – Derek’s idea – Break down a rollercoaster and put it back together (everyone gets a piece). 23)  Draw a rectangle and cut it – Other geometrical shapes 24)  Lego We-Do:  Motor, Distance Sensor, etc., to control legos – Only work for Scratch 1.4 right now. 25)  Matthew:  Create puzzles similar to those from The Incredible Machine  Derek:  Scratch has recently looked at that.  Game:  Portal, Portal Ed – Requires intense hardware. 26) Challenge - Fill the space with a thin pen line - (random movement?) 27)  Check ScratchEd Thread for questions you have"
23958,Scratch Educator Meetup Breakout Session Notes: Scratch Assessment Strategies,11/22/13 11:30,"Special thanks to Josh Tappan for taking these notes during the ""Scratch Assessment Strategies"" breakout session at the November 2013 Scratch educator meetup, help at MIT on November 2, 2013. Scratch Assessment Strategies Purpose of assessment? 1. Know what someone is able to do 2. Feedback about what was learned. 3. Understanding knowledge kids are using 4. Judgment about performance 5. A way of seeing how well teacher’s teach and students learn 6. Demonstration of knowledge or skills 7. Giving learners an opportunity to make learning visible Challenges of assessment 1. What does it mean to assess Scratch? 2. How to evaluate a project in a rigorous manner? 3. What would the rubric look like? 4. Two approaches to assessment: a. Looking at an artifact and understanding the process b. Having students explaining their own process and arrival at final result c. How to do this in Scratch? 5. How to separate the task and creative process from the assessment? 6. What standards are being met through a project? 7. Assessment related to medium vs. assessment related to message. What does it mean to assess Scratch projects or computer science projects in general? Strategies for assessment 1. Tie projects into “Habits of Mind” standards 2. Scratch rubric example: http://scratched.media.mit.edu/resources/rubric-assessing-scratch-projects-draft-0 3. Ramapo School district rubric: https://docs.google.com/file/d/14bbr5_UQNeWHpSi9ni1PK6qZmF3OmfyZGkeslX0XsIw/edit?usp=drive_web&pli=1 4. ScratchEd curriculum guide: http://scratched.media.mit.edu/resources/scratch-curriculum-guide-draft 5. Prioritize teacher communities to discuss assessment to deepen understanding of computer science skills. 6. Use examples of projects for typical levels of understanding for comparison 7. Columns: “I need to learn how to use this” “I can use this” “I can teach someone else how to use this” to assess what students know. 8.

I'm just about to begin folding Scratch into my classroom, and I'd love to hear how that went for other people who teach in Canada's north. I'm a little nervous about the whole project because I'll be learning right alongside the kids, but I think there's some greta potential there. I'd be especially interested to hear about anyone's experiences using Scratch as a motivating tool for ELL students, of which I have many.

36402,Scratch for autistic children,8/31/15 22:34,"Hi, I was recently approached by a learning center to teach an autistic child programming. The mother and school approached me having read that computer science is a suitable knowledge/ skill for the child. I started off with showing the child some simple scratch animations ( e.g. how to make the fish swim in an aquarium), but I'm not sure if I was getting through to him. I do understand autistic kids have different learning capabilities, and have read up as much as I could to prepare myself for the lesson. Does anybody else have such an experience with autistic kids, and have any ideas of what are suitable projects to start them off with? Any help would be much appreciated. Thanks, David"
36402,Scratch for autistic children,9/1/15 17:02,"Hi David, These are great questions. I think your approach of experimenting with different entry points and checking in often with the student to see what works for them is a good one. I've worked in inclusive classrooms with several students with autism and one thing I've found helpful to keep in mind is that each student with autism is as variable as any other learner (in terms of likes, dislikes, strengths and weaknesses). I wonder if some of the activities from the Creative Computing Curriculum Guide could be useful in this case. For example, you could sit with the student and let them click around the Scratch interface, seeing what happens as they click? Maybe you could look at a variety of projects (of their choosing) together and let them point out something they would like to be able to create or remix? For many students with autism, abundant choice and lack of structure is overwhelming, so perhaps an activity with constraints - like Ten Blocks (also from the CC guide) - would be a helpful place to start? A few other resources I found that might be helpful: Here is a brief discussion of the ways in which the Scratch online community can be helpful for some students with autism. Here is a ScratchEd Discussion about working with students with disabilities. Here is an article about programming and students with autism. Here is a list of tips for teachers working with students on the autism spectrum. I hope some of this is useful. I hope we can continue this conversation and keep sharing resources. Thanks, Willa"

Thank you very much for the links, I will try out some of the suggestions and will share again on my experience with the child. Cheers! David"
36402,Scratch for autistic children,3/19/16 12:35,"Hi David. I teach Scratch children with intellectual disability. In the past when work with autism didn't know about Scratch. But based on my experience, think that if you asked mother about special interest of her child. And create individual activity, it  can help. For example if he like pirates make the Scratch activities with use of pirates images."

13005,Scratch for iPad,6/13/12 12:25,"Let me caution people not too expect too much. The iPad version of Scratch will be limited by both the hardware and by Apple's policies. It may not support all the features of Scratch 2.0, some projects may run slowly, and, due to Apple's policies, it might not be allowed to download and run projects from the Scratch website. There are two basic approaches to iPad Scratch (HTML5 vs. native iPad App), and each approach has strenghts and weaknesses. We will explore both approaches. However, as Karen wrote, our hightest priority at the moment is to release Scratch 2.0. Nevertheless, I do agree with general feeling that, even with some limitiations, Scratch on the iPad would be lovely. -- John P.S.

11048,Scratch hogs my CPU,11/15/11 19:40,How come scratch takes up well over 10% of my CPU even when I'm not running any programs in Scratch? Has anyone else observed this or come up with an explanation? It seems excessive.
11048,Scratch hogs my CPU,11/16/11 6:33,"I asked John Maloney (the lead developer of Scratch) about this, and here's what he had to say: It's a combination of several things -- first, Scratch tries to keep thumbnails of sprites updated as the sprites change. Although there are optimizations that save most of the work when nothing changes, it still takes some processing time just to check. When I first open Scratch viewing the default project, Scratch consumes about 2.5% of the CPU on my MacBook Pro. If I open a project with many sprites, it goes up to 4.3% However, there a more significant cycle consumer. The sound player seems to use about 11% of my CPU even when no sounds are playing. The sound player is started the first time any sound is played and it is never shut down after that. So Scratch burns about 13.5% of the CPU time on my computer after playing a sound. Finally, if you use the ""loudness"" or ""loud"" blocks, that opens the sound input channel, which seems to burn another 5%. I agree, this seems excessive for ""doing nothing"". Scratch should probably turn off the sound input and output channels when they haven't been used for a while."

I work in a French immersion school and I know Scratch is promoted and used in France in schools because I saw trainings happening in France right now.

2442,Scratch in Low Bandwidth Environments,1/27/10 14:02,"Hi All, Unfortunately for us here in Afghanistan one of the normal desirable features to have for Scratching, a reasonable Internet connection for using scratch.mit.edu etc. isn't really accessible.  So thought I would share what we're doing here about it and see if anyone else around here has had similar experience. For our implementation of OLPC I have made an offline library system so that the library works over the school LAN. I have just written a scratch downloader program in Java that given the ID of a gallery will download all the projects in that Gallery, their thumbnail, and description.  Works pretty nice so far - downloaded over a thousand scratch programs to our external server in Germany in around 2 hrs, and can then download them overnight to Afghanistan.  I can then make that work with the Nutch search engine so that we can then search through the contents. I'm just digging into exelearning (www.exelearning.org) at the moment which is quite a nice framework for making curriculum e-learning material and I'm developing in Python an iDevice for this to make it easier to add Scratch projects to enhance curriculum materials. I'm also wondering about how we are going to share the localization work that we do on the projects that demonstrate the curriculum content.  Possibly we could upload the project as a remix and we could write a program to automatically do this in batch overnight. Regards, -Mike"
2442,Scratch in Low Bandwidth Environments,1/30/10 10:14,"Mike, I am working at OLPC and what you are doing sound very useful, specially to deployments. Are you registered to any of the OLPC lists? http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Community_mailing_lists The list of ""educators"" is interesting for the type of work you are doing, and for technical stuff ""devel"". I am not sure I understand what you mean by ""localization work we do on the projects"". Can you send an example? Best regards, Claudia"

16435,Scratch Language and Terms for a course for middle school aged children,2/16/13 16:46,"Hi! I'm writing a video game design course for middle school aged children.  The course will be broken up into three sections and logically they will be: Introduction to Programming & Video Game Design, Video Game Design I and Video Game Design II. The goal of the course is to teach the children to feel comfortable using technology, to have fun while problem solving with technology and to be expressive and creative with technology. In the Introduction part of the course the children will learn about the various terms used when programming and how to use Scratch.  My questions are as follows: 1.  Is coding or programming the best way to describe what they do with Scratch?  What is more commonly used?  Or more importantly what term is a better explanation of what they are doing? 2.  What should I tell the students they are called?  For example: Video Game Designers, Programmers, Developers.  Which description is the most appropirate for what they will be doing? 3.  What is the best way to describe Scratch?  I know in the Scratch videos created by Scratch it is referred to as a programming language.  Is it correct to always refer to it as the Scratch programming languge?  Is fine to say, "" Today you will learn how to use the Scratch program""? I taught with Scratch in the past but that course was a summer camp and there wasn't enough time to cover too much. The program I'm developing now is longer and much more involved in the terms and goes into the many types of projects that can be created with Scratch (the first projects will be animated stories and interactive art).

24712,scratch on chromebook,1/2/14 4:29,"I am planning to teach Scratch in a class where most students are on Chromebooks. I saw at least one post here that made it sound like there were problems on Chromebooks, but I have also seen posts saying there should be no problem. Do you have experiences with Scratch on particular Chromebook models that either did or did not turn out well?"
13198,Scratch on the Raspberry Pi,6/25/12 6:21,"Hi, I am a teacher and a Raspberry Pi owner. I wonder if any of you have seen the MagPi magazine - it had an article on Scratch (not by me) in thefirst issue. I am planning to write something for the next issue. You can have a look at what I have so far here. (pdf). It's very simple stuff. I am hoping to do more as I learn how to use Scratch more. I'm probably going to focus on learning fairly traditional programming skills (as in the examples in the article) rather than making games and animations. I'll have to see what the editorial team on the MagPi think! Anyway, if anyone has advice and feedback, I'd appreciate it. mark"
13198,Scratch on the Raspberry Pi,6/26/12 22:51,"Hi Mark, Thank you so much for sharing this information. I'm looking forward to buy a Raspberry Pi this year; first time hearing about the MagPi Magazine so I started to download the two (2) available issues. I think your focus it's unique and it's fair to have variety. Awesome examples with comments included and of course the ""Hello World!"" was necessary! Hope to see more coming. Carlos."
13198,Scratch on the Raspberry Pi,6/27/12 3:08,"Hi Carlos, Thanks so much for your comment. The Scratch article has been changed quite a bit (we're looking to release Issue 3 at the weekend). I am ""racypy""  on the Scratch forum, if you want to see what I am up to! mark"
13198,Scratch on the Raspberry Pi,6/28/12 5:23,"Hi Mark, I too am excited by the rpi but as yet just have it running in a virtual machine. For me the hardware add-ons will be key and would hope that things like Lego Wedo will be supported on the Scratch port for rpi. I liked your examples very much however am worried that you want to focus on traditional programming skills using Scratch. I don't believe Scratch is the correct tool for that. For me the whole point of Scratch is the lack of a command line and focus on multimedia to ease and engage the learning process for children. I think a Scratch ""Hello World!"" program should be spinning and whirling coloured letters shooting around the screen accompanied by a fanfare of trumpets! Good luck with the article, Mark"
13198,Scratch on the Raspberry Pi,6/28/12 6:10,"I just joined ScratchEd. I'd been looking at it for awhile, but wanting to reply to Mark T's post was what finally spurred me to join. I was going to write exactly what Mark W said. The jist of the your MagPi article is kind of ""how do you do traditional CS in Scratch"". Now there is a place for that (I'll tell you about some ideas I've had in a minute) but for only the second Scrach article in the MagPi, I feel that it might be a bit on the dry side. Jaseman's Dizzy Cat / Crazy Drums in Issue 1 is much more in keeping with the ... Scratch ethos (for lack of a better word). I've been giving some Scratch lessons in my daughter's Year 4 class. The lessons were as follows: 1. Intro to Scratch, sprites, scripts, costumes, the ""say"" and ""change costumes"" blocks. I created a tiny program where the cat says ""I wish I was a dinosaur"", then it changes into a dino courtesy of an imported sprite, then says ""Hooray!"" Then I got them to do their own thing. 2. Stroytelling with Scratch. How to use backgrounds, sound, motion, and ""say"" to tell stories. In this case it was a ghost story. The cat is in some dark woods, along comes a ghost with a scary noise, cat screams and runs away (well, ""glides"" away, we haven't done animation yet). The idea of this lesson was that you have 2 or more sprites, and you have to make sure that you put the code that you want the two different sprites to execute in the scripts for those different sprites. This is something that some of the kids in the first lesson were trying to do, but couldn't figure out. Again, they were let loose on the computers to do their own thing. I have two more lessons planned, as follows: 3. Animation. I'm going to show them how to use the repeat loop, custume change, and more instrcutions to make a bat fly across the screen. My daughter has already started playing with this sort of thing at home, for example making people dance while playing cool music. 4. Question & answer, making choices. I'm going to show them a little program where the cat asks them where they want to go on holiday and how much money they have. If they have enough money then the background will change according to the holiday destination selected. Only here do they meet variables, user input, if'/then/else, and operators (<). This is the sort of thing that I think makes a better intro to Scratch than how to do traditional CS things in Scratch. Where the traditional CS things are really useful is in cross curricular activities, combining science and maths. For example, the Year 6s learn about some basic stats: mean, mode, median. Showing them how to implement this in Scratch is a good way to help them understand the stats themselves and how computers handle data. It's also cool to have real data that you yourself have harvested, for example using the Picoboard to record niose levels in your classroom. At least, I think... This is definitely an untested lesson plan!"
13198,Scratch on the Raspberry Pi,6/28/12 6:49,"Thanks Myra, for your detailed replies. It certainly sounds like you have some great ideas for teaching with Scratch. Just to give a bit of context for my ""article"" (by the way, the latest draft is a bit different, but still probably rather dry. It does have a game on it now!), I am a teacher in a UK high-school. Most of the kids I teach (and I am an English teacher, not an ICT specialist!) already have some experience of Scratch and what they've done is mainly the making of stories, animations and games. My agenda was always to use Scratch to explore basic programming ideas that might be useful to the students when they begin to learn Python (or whatever). The MagPi is written by volunteers, so the content depends pretty much on the interests of the contributor. I agree that there are lots of things that one can do with Scratch that are more ""Scratchy"" than my scripts (and more fun). I am stil a beginner at using Scratch. I'm sure the editorial team would be happy to publish material with a focus like the one you have taken, if you (or anyone else!) approached them. The idea about environmental data / input sounds amazing, by the way. I've certainly taken your comments on board. thanks mark :)"
13198,Scratch on the Raspberry Pi,6/28/12 6:59,"Thanks Mark, for your comment. I don't know anything about Lego Wedo, but the idea of connecting the Pi to external devices is certainly key. So far I've experimented a bit with the GPIO pins using LEDs and a switch, but that's all. I'm interested to read your comments on the article. As I said in reply to Myra (who made similar points), I do accept the criticism. I know the team at the MagPi is keen to keep running articles on Scratch and this month I ""stepped up"" to offer some material. I'm not sure if the editors will want me to continue. If they do, I'll certainly try to make my next article more fun. It's only fair for me to admit that one reason for the approach I took is my lack of experience as a Scratcher! Thanks very much for your reply. I appreciate the time you've taken and the constructive criticism! :) mark By the way, since you are running a virtual Pi, I am interested in which release you are using."
13198,Scratch on the Raspberry Pi,6/28/12 18:25,"Hi Mark, I think your article goes well with Alex's later article in issue 3. You've bravely given your email address in the article but I wondered if your racypy Scratch ID might be better as the projects could also be downloaded? My intention was not to criticize but more as a warning. I develop software but have recently started a computer club at my son's primary school. They are very quick to see the possibilities when you show them Scratch can play sounds and the sprites move and animate. Having got that attention then adding in logic and loops to futher control things is much easier than the opposite direction which is; here is a loop, here is some logic etc.. Your article has given me some ideas. I think the dice simulator is crying out for 6 costumes representing each side of a die and that wonderful sound as dice bounce across a table top. That's why I didn't want to be negative as that is what the article should be doing. As for my virtual Pi it was a virtual box ovi file from February so probably a bit dated. Kind regards, Mark"
13198,Scratch on the Raspberry Pi,6/29/12 2:18,"Hi Mark, yes I was thinking about adding my Scratch ID - I just forgot to do that. I'll see if I can get that included before we publish. I don't think I have uploaded all the scripts I mentioned in the article yet. I will do that. I'll have a go at what you suggest for the dice program. Hope you are enjoying the RPi. It might be worth downloading the latest Arch release, if you have a chance. It runs faster than the Debian versions ;)"
13198,Scratch on the Raspberry Pi,6/30/12 2:45,This makes quite a nice die roll. Just need 6 costumes  that look like each face. Just needs some sound and perhaps a bit more bouncing! Note: Scratch can get addictive! I've created a project called dice roll that uses the above effects then plots the probablity distribution of the rolls. Find it under my Scratch user id drmcw if interested.
13198,Scratch on the Raspberry Pi,6/30/12 17:39,"Mark W, I love your die roll! Your project plotting the distribution of numbers you get from the die is exactly the sort of cross-curricular thing I was talking about... Nice link with maths there! Here's a Scratch science project I've done for myself that would be really cool to do with some kids sometime... I grabbed a thermistor from the shed (doesn't everyone have a collection of electronics in their shed? -- my hubby does electronics for a living and occasionally as a hobby), froze it into an ice cube, attached it to one of the analog inputs of a Picoboard, then plotted the restistance (which corresponds roughly to the temperature). This is the resulting graph: The horizontal blue line is about 0C; the ticks along that line are the hours. I love this graph. It shows clear as can be that the temperature remains pretty much constant while the ice is melting, and only then once it's all melted does the termperature climb again, asympotically approaching room temp. Yes, you can do real science with Scratch!"
13198,Scratch on the Raspberry Pi,6/30/12 17:42,"Ha, too much indentation in my post below, you can't see my lovely melting ice graph! Here it is, unindented..."
13198,Scratch on the Raspberry Pi,7/1/12 6:09,"Excellent! I'll have a look at your Scratch page! Yes, I do find Scratch strangely addictive ..."
13198,Scratch on the Raspberry Pi,7/1/12 6:11,This is a really great idea. I wonder if I could do something similar using the GPIO pins on the Raspberry Pi! mark
13198,Scratch on the Raspberry Pi,7/1/12 11:37,Agreed. Saw the post about the xbox kinect and Scratch which pointed me to the remote sensing protocol in Scratch. I'm sure that could be use ti access the GPIO pins with a small helper program. Might have to buy a rpi sooner rather than later. Would also  want to add a webcam with microphone. Have you tried any out to record pictures and sound in Scratch by any chance?
13198,Scratch on the Raspberry Pi,7/1/12 13:21,"Hi Folks, we have too much indentation below, so I've clicked the Post Reply button rather than replying to a specific post. Mark T wrote "" I wonder if I could do something similar using the GPIO pins on the Raspberry Pi!"" The answer is, yes you can. You would need an analog to digital converter. I have been working on the Gertboard, and conveniently, it has exactly such a device. I could easily solder up something that would allow me to connect a thermistor to the A/D inputs of the the Gertboard. So then I could collect the data using a C program. And then the question is how to plot it... It has been a long time since I did anything graphical in C, does anyone by any chance have any suggestions for a good library to use to allow me to plot a graph similar to the one I made in Scratch? I know how to do graphics in Python (well... I'm learning Python, and I know where to look to find out how to do graphics in Python), and I have a Python GPIO module, so I could do it in Python... except that the Python GPIO module code doesn't drive the SPI bus, and the A/D chip uses the SPI bus... So I'd have to figure out how to do SPI in Python. So I have to hand almost all the tools I need to duplicate this experiment on the Pi! Ah, I've just thought of a way I could do it: I could collect the data using a C program, then put it into a file, then in Scratch I could read the data from the file into a list, then I could plot the data in the same way I plotted the data collected by the Picoboard! Then I could do the whole thing on the Raspberry Pi. It would be more elegant to either (re)learn how to plot things in C, or how to drive the SPI bus in Python..."
13198,Scratch on the Raspberry Pi,7/2/12 14:18,Sounds great. Really like the thermistor stuff. Does the picoboard work with the raspbery pi? P.S. Mark's card shuffling demo and your mention of recording sound gave me the inspiration to write a SNAP card game using the microphone in Scratch. Uploaded the project earlier today if interested! (Unlikely to be useful in a noisy classroom though)
13198,Scratch on the Raspberry Pi,7/2/12 17:03,"Embarassingly, I haven't yet tried the Picoboard with the RPi. .... OK, I just did! It works beautifully. Just plugged it in, and it works. This is using the new Debian Wheezy OS. I haven't been able to make WeDo work with the RPi yet, but I do have some ideas I can pursue. I think that it's quite likely that I can make it work, with the help of my husband who is a systems and hardware expert."
13198,Scratch on the Raspberry Pi,7/4/12 16:18,Just seen your article in issue 3 of Magpi. Well done!
13198,Scratch on the Raspberry Pi,7/7/12 16:18,"Thanks, The good news is that the editorial team (I'm sort of on the fringe of it!) want me to do more on Scratch. I'll try to do something more fun next time."
13198,Scratch on the Raspberry Pi,7/7/12 16:21,"Wow - I am so impressed that you are using your Pi and Scratch like this! I am not much of a hardware person ... It'd be great to see more about these projects. Do you have a blog, Myra - or maybe you could do an article for the MagPi? mark"
13198,Scratch on the Raspberry Pi,7/7/12 16:26,"Hi Mark, I hope you do get an RPi soon - sounds like you have some great ideas for it. I don't know if anyone has done anything with recording audio on the Pi as yet - there's no analogue audio input (just a headphone jack). I don't know what happens if you plug in USB microphone / headset. These sorts of projects will certainly get the young people interested. :)"
13198,Scratch on the Raspberry Pi,7/7/12 19:47,"Hey Mark, bought my Raspberry Pi 2 days ago; just waiting to play with it!"
13198,Scratch on the Raspberry Pi,7/10/12 3:47,"We've slightly modified Scratch to allow it to use addon boards with the Raspberry Pi (through the SPI bus).  Using the PiFace board (http://piface.openlx.org.uk), we've also got interfaces for Scratch, Python and C http://pi.cs.man.ac.uk/interface.htm. Our idea is that people can mix and match and move between the languages as they learn more. We've got some local activities working with teachers developing worksheets, but when I saw this I wondered if people would be interested in some sort of online colaboration?"
13198,Scratch on the Raspberry Pi,7/10/12 5:00,"Yes, this sounds like something I would be interested in. I've done a fair bit of work on the Gertboard so I'm familiar with the idea of using the GPIO to do things in the real world."
13198,Scratch on the Raspberry Pi,7/10/12 13:15,There's a demo of it on youtube http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhaWDUAuajE including our emulator -- I'm looking at porting it to other boards like Gertboard.
13198,Scratch on the Raspberry Pi,7/11/12 6:12,"Yes, that would be a great idea. I am quite ignorant about Scratch and external devices (and I'm very much a beginner at Scratch anyway). Please feel free to email me at: antiloquax@sky.com thanks, mark"
13198,Scratch on the Raspberry Pi,7/11/12 7:25,"Breaking news! As of last night, I have got Lego WeDo working with the Raspberry Pi, with the help of Alex Bradbury. This is with the Debian wheezy SD card image. At the moment, wheezy is still in the testing phase with the Raspberry Pi, but feedback on it is so positive that after this weekend it's going to be the recommended distro. Alex (who's organizing the release of wheezy on the RPi) will incorporate the changes that allow WeDo to work into the Scratch that's included with the wheezy SD card image, so WeDo will work straight out of the box! Hooray!"
13198,Scratch on the Raspberry Pi,7/11/12 15:00,"Excellent news. Things seem to be progressing at quite a pace. Feel rather out of the loop so maybe should order one..... Have bitten the bullet and am in the queue, so no idea when I'll actually get it. Just wondering what they intend to do for schools as at the moment you can only order one per person?"
13198,Scratch on the Raspberry Pi,7/12/12 1:44,"I just thought I'd give you a preview of what I am working on for next Month's Scratch Patch. Like I have said, I am a beginner. This is actually the first Scratch project I've made that uses animation and sound. I would appreciate some feedback. On issue is that we are quite short of space in the Magazine (I only get 2 pages) so I will have to keep the project quite small. Anyway ... it's a (simple!) version of Frogger: EDIT - I've added some project notes. Thanks! mark"
13198,Scratch on the Raspberry Pi,7/11/12 12:10,I run a computer club at my son's primary school and the lego wedo proved a hit. Using external hardware would certanly be of interest. I need to order an rpi for myself and see if I can get the school interested in using it too. Any collaboration could well be of interest.
13198,Scratch on the Raspberry Pi,7/11/12 12:10,"This is excellent news Myra. I've mentioned the great stuff that the Scratch community are doing to the MagPi team. They are very impressed. I've posted a link to something I am working on for next month's magazine, I'll repost it here. If I can get my act together to do something that shows Scratch interacting with the outside world, I will definitely write about it in the magazine. Frogger clone."
13198,Scratch on the Raspberry Pi,7/12/12 5:34,"I just had a lesson with some Y8 students in which I showed them my frogger game and told them about the RPi foundation's competition. Then I let them choose to improve my game or make their own. I was impressed with what they did. I'm an English teacher so I don't often get the chance to do this. They had done some Scratching before, but I'm not sure how much. Anyway , most of them seemed to get the idea pretty quickly (quicker that I did!) :)"
13198,Scratch on the Raspberry Pi,7/12/12 6:17,"Just had a go with your Frogger. It's good! The sound effects are excellent. Just a few suggestions: Arrow keys are easier to use than letter keys (maybe use left arrow for left, right arrow for right). The frog sometimes ends up under the log rather than on top of it. Under looks there is a ""go to front"" block which would probably sort the program. Maybe a better picture of a frog? But then I'm so not an artist that I feel I really have no right to complain about this!! Anyway, it's nice. It's basic, but this is a good thing: it sets them thinking ""hey, it would be better if..."" and then they start to look into how they can make it better."
13198,Scratch on the Raspberry Pi,7/12/12 10:27,"Thanks Myra, I'll change the keys. I'll have a look for that ""go to front"" block, I haven't used it before. I have had a go a re-drawing the frog. I'm not much good at art ... I do need to keep it simple as anything that looks much nicer would take up quite a bit more room in the magazine. Although I have realised how to use a background instead of sprites for the ""water"" and ""river-bank""!! mark"
13198,Scratch on the Raspberry Pi,7/16/12 16:51,"Instead of drawing a frog, why not use  the 2 scratch cat sprites? Changing the costume makes it look like he's waliking. You can call it Scratcher instead of Frogger! Well ordered the raspberry pi and now have to wait 11 weeks! So should get it for halloween!"
13198,Scratch on the Raspberry Pi,7/12/12 16:45,Just downloaded to look at the scripts and yes you need to use the stage background and just have sprites for the logs and frog.
13198,Scratch on the Raspberry Pi,7/16/12 10:21,"Hi Mark, Yes, I realised that I should use a background. I had not got around to updating my Scratch file. Like I said, I'm a beginner ..."
13198,Scratch on the Raspberry Pi,8/2/12 9:13,Issue 4 of Magpi out now. Well done with the Frogger game.
13198,Scratch on the Raspberry Pi,9/16/12 4:11,"I now have a raspberrypi! One thing that hasn't been mentioned here but is a topic on the raspberrypi forum is the performance of scratch on the raspberrypi or rather lack of. As it stands, its not a combination I could recommend. What are others thoughts?"
13198,Scratch on the Raspberry Pi,9/18/12 15:47,"Hi Mark, Sorry I haven't been on here and answered your posts. Glad to hear you have a Pi. As I guess you have seen if you go on the RPi forums, there is some discussion going on about the performance of Scratch. As far as I know, nothing major has been done yet. I did try to recompile Squeak from source, but I ran into a heap of problems and gave up. I will probably have another go at some point. But really it needs the Scratch developers to sort something out ..."
13198,Scratch on the Raspberry Pi,9/22/12 12:55,That's ok. Not sure Scratch is the problem I think the VM needs some work and JITing it would be just what's needed. Started looking at it myself but its not within my skillset...at the moment!
13198,Scratch on the Raspberry Pi,9/29/12 17:07,"Thanks Mark, sorry I haven't replied until now. The October issue will feature a little Bubble Sort program. I have also been having fun with Scratch with my GCSE computing group - we've done a program to convert denary to binary, and one that does Hex."
13198,Scratch on the Raspberry Pi,9/30/12 4:08,Look forward to that. Have checked out the convertors and you need to add a test for negative numbers and fractions!
13198,Scratch on the Raspberry Pi,10/4/12 1:13,"Hi Mark, Thanks for you feedback on the binary and hex converters. I don't think I know how to do that yet! I need to brush up on my understanding of two's complement and floating point numbers in binary! mark"
13198,Scratch on the Raspberry Pi,10/4/12 13:54,Was thinking more of defensive programming so detecting a negative number or fraction and asking user to re-enter a positive integer.
13198,Scratch on the Raspberry Pi,10/5/12 2:55,"Hi Mark - yes, I see what you mean. That would be sensible. However, I want to tackle the more complex side of binary representation at some point. I am teaching GCSE computing and I have been using Scratch to ease my Y11 students into programming.  Most of them had used it a bit to make animations etc, but not really to create more ""traditional"" programs. Thanks for your comment!"
13198,Scratch on the Raspberry Pi,1/3/14 3:06,"I'm about to ask for Raspberry Pi & Arduino kits as a DonorsChoose project. Anyone know if this particular kit (with ""Raspbian"") will be ""WeDo-ready"" out of the box? I'll be back!"
13198,Scratch on the Raspberry Pi,1/3/14 11:52,Looks a nice kit. Raspberry Pi only runs Scratch 1.4 which does support Wedo out of the box although I have only ever used it on a Windows machine and not the Raspberry Pi. So I'd expect it to work but am not 100% certain as haven't tried that.
13198,Scratch on the Raspberry Pi,4/6/14 17:13,"So, I finally got the R-pi and have confirmed that the Raspbian distribution works with the LEGO WeDo system just fine. Yay! However, not so much luck with the laptops I tried. Boo. (I installed the Ubermix [Ubuntu] distro on 2 old-ish Dell Latitude D610's, and the WeDo USB connection does NOT seem to be working/recognized on either laptop. The special blocks do not appear in Scratch, nor does any sensor or motor work, even if I make the blocks appear by using the menu, then put them in a program. And yes, I tried all of the USB ports.) I'd welcome any clues for trouble-shooting this -- or connections to folks who might know something abuut how/why the Raspbian distro DOES work with Scratch+WeDo. I'll also post separately..."

6327,Scratch Professional Learning Community Organizing,9/11/10 18:21,"Last spring, an international group of educators met monthly by Skype to share ideas about using Scratch with students and to try out a collaborative project between schools.  We are interested in continuing the project and welcome new participants. Two ideas behind this project are that adults learn by processing experiences and that to really implement change in classroom practice, it helps to have on-going support. The group keeps a private wikispaces site to record minutes of our conversations and keep in touch between meetings. The meeting format is generally an hour long conference call focused on a topic.  We start with check-ins from everyone and try to end with a reflection on the topic and the meeting from everyone. To deal with time zone challenges, last year we met on Sundays at 1:00 GMT, but this year's group could look for a different common time. For last year's collaborative project, students from five schools passed along a remix project about the foods they eat at special celebrations. ( http://scratch.mit.edu/galleries/view/74573) We've talked about trying a storytelling project this year, but nothing is decided yet. Here are links to the notes from a few of our conversations, posted on Scratch-Ed: http://scratched.media.mit.edu/resources/scratch-plc-conversation-1-lesson-design http://scratched.media.mit.edu/resources/scratch-plc-conversation-2-teaching-programming-concepts http://scratched.media.mit.edu/resources/scratch-plc-conversation-3-integrating-scratch-subject-areas If this sounds like fun to you or if you have questions, send me an e-mail: .  At the end of the month, we'll have a session on Skype to see how the group wants to organize this year.

Our MIT Scratch Team friends just shared an explanation... Hi Scratchers, As many of you may have noticed, we've been having trouble keeping Scratch running smoothly for the past day. Part of this is due to some updates to Scratch that were made on Wednesday night. In addition, on Thursday morning Scratch experienced a large growth in site traffic due to a number of articles linking to Scratch in the media. While all this attention is great (yay!) we haven't been able to deal with it as well as we would have liked (boo!). Here is what we are doing right now: We have put some small measures into place to help deal with the large influx of traffic We are working on resolving and rolling back some of the changes made on Wednesday night We are working on getting another server into production to help handle the additional load We are very sorry for the trouble that this is causing for many of you and hope to have Scratch back up and running normally soon!

Developing the Teacher Accounts has been more challenging than we expected -- and we know the delays have been frustrating for you. We now have a working prototype, and we will start alpha testing with a small group of teachers later this month. Based on feedback and requests we have received from educators using Scratch, we have focused on two main areas in this first version of Teacher Accounts: Account creation. Teachers will be able to create accounts for an entire class of students Classroom management. Teachers will be able to keep track of students’ work and participation on Scratch. Here’s a sneak peek at some screenshots from the current implementation of Teacher Accounts... A teacher can have multiple Classes: Each Class contains Students, Studios, and an Activity feed: Each Class also has a profile page on Scratch similar to a Member’s profile page: We are excited to share this update with you. If you have any questions or suggestions, please add them to this ScratchEd thread. -- Mitch Resnick and Christan Balch, for the MIT Scratch Team"

39598,Scratch Teacher Accounts,7/13/16 9:19,"In this student-teacher environment, will it be possible for the student to just share their work with just the teacher or, optionally, just with the class and not with the entire Scratch community?  Those of us who work with younger students have to go through a lot of paperwork with parents to allow them to create accounts that can be shared with the wider community.  If the student doesn't share with the whole community, I cannot see the project unless I log in as him/her.  With 200 students a term (middle school), that is a lot of tedious logging in work.  It would be so much easier if we could limit the people they can share their work with. Thank you so much for this enhancement, it will make things a lot easier and allow us to continue keeping our kids insulated on the web. Paula"

Looking forward to the release!  Let me know if you need any additional alpha/beta testers!"

39598,Scratch Teacher Accounts,8/5/16 16:27,"Where is the date on the post that says the alpha will be tested ""later this month""? What month? And please let us know if there is some type of formal process to apply to be part of the testing. I, for one, would like to participate if possible. Please be sensitive to educator needs and give us as much information about timing as possible. I can't afford to wait around before buidling my curriculum blocks for this year and if it sounds like this is not going to be available by the time school begins the first week of September, I wish we would be informed of that. I have turn in my topics list soon and do not want to include something that is not going to work out. Adding or substituting units during the year is something I try to avoid."

Scratch Teacher Accounts enable educators to create and manage classes, student accounts, and class studios. If you are interested in learning more about or registering a new Teacher Account, you can do this on the Educators page on the Scratch website: https://scratch.mit.edu/educators/ We look forward to continuing to improve the site to support you and your students’ participation on Scratch.

43921,Scratch Teacher Accounts now Available,8/12/16 21:39,So excited about the teacher accounts! Is there a limit to the number of students that can be assigned to a class? I noticed that the csv file upload has a limit of 50. Thank you Scratch Team! You are all heroes!

43921,Scratch Teacher Accounts now Available,8/17/16 9:00,"So excited about teacher accounts!  Yay!  I have a quick question...once I've set up each class, and added my students, how do they log in?  Do they sign in with my teacher username and password? Also, I set up a test student to try to figure this out myself...how can I delete that test student?  Thank you!"
43921,Scratch Teacher Accounts now Available,8/17/16 10:12,"Hi Karen. Good questions! The password for student accounts depends on how you created their accounts. Did you use a CSV, email link, or create the accounts one at a time? If you used a CSV then you predetermined their password when you created the accounts. If you used the email link, then students create their own password by following the link. If you created the accounts one by one, then the password is your Teacher Account username (they will be prompted to change this after logging in for the first time). In order to delete the test account, you will need to sign into that account and delete it through the Account Settings menu. We have created a Teacher Account FAQ page as well as a video about Teacher Accounts that I think might be helpful in answering some of your questions :) I hope this helps!"

43921,Scratch Teacher Accounts now Available,8/21/16 20:57,"I've been trying to test adding in a student account from the email link, but any username I try using has already been taken according to the error message that gets generated. The only thing that's worked is the CSV import. I'm also unclear about the accessibility of the Student account: If I close a class, does the Student account that is created become unusable to the student? Is the workflow to get them to create a personal scratch account and transfer the work done from the teacher created Student account, to their new personal account?"

HOWEVER, is there a way for me to see their work easily?  Is this what the studio function is for?  Am I missing a help file or video on this topic.  I watched the intro video which was helpful, but when he created the sample ""Studio"" he really didn't explain its function. I appologize if I have missed this post or instruction. Thank you!"
43921,Scratch Teacher Accounts now Available,9/5/16 18:38,"Setting up the student accounts for my classrooms.  I just accidently added a group of students with a .csv upload to the wrong classroom.  There appears to be no way to manually move them across to their correct classroom and I am unable to delete their accounts. Any suggestions to get the moved into their correct classroom and out of the ""test"" classroom?  I'm probably just going to rename test to Grade 8 but for my own information is there a way to move a student or do they have the option to Leave a classroom and then join another?"
43921,Scratch Teacher Accounts now Available,9/12/16 15:29,"I am having trouble figuring out how these teacher accounts work. I added a student to a test class using a generated link and it says that student in the class. If I heard right, I have to make all of the kids in my class curators in order to see all of their work in one place. I don't really understand what that means, but I tried to do that with my test student by clicking Invite Curators and selecting that student and clicking Add but a message shows up saying that only members of the class can be curators. This person is already in the class but can't be added as a curator. I'm trying to figure out what the benefit is to using a Teacher Account versus just having the kids make accounts and share links with me. I thought these accounts would be easier to navigate and allow a teacher to give a course code or link to students who would then enroll in the class and all projects that students created would appear in that classroom. It seems there is an awful lot of set up required to get this working and I'm having trouble figuring it all out. I have many new students to Scratch and they are not happy about being forced to share their very beginner work with the universe. I get the whole Share with All thing but there should be occasions that teachers (especially of younger students) should be afforded the option to wall off their classes so kids are free to learn and experiment without doing it in public."
43921,Scratch Teacher Accounts now Available,9/13/16 14:25,"Hi Ann! Thanks for the post. Scratch Teacher Accounts are new, and our team is still working out the kinks - thanks to comments from people like yourself! Regarding your question about studios, all Student Accounts created within a class will automatically be added as curators for any studios created in that class. We have noticed a 10-15 minute delay in seeing these Student Accounts appear in the “curator” section of the class; perhaps this is what happened during your test? When we built Student Accounts, we made the decision to align these accounts with regular Scratcher accounts in many ways, including their relationship to the greater community. This was because we have seen time and again the importance of the community in supporting and encouraging Scratchers to keep coding. That said, we also understand your concerns about sharing publicly on Scratch. Keep in mind that you can always choose to use the offline version of Scratch instead, which removes the online community entirely from the equation. Thank you again for sharing your thoughts. Hopefully I have provided a bit of insight into how these accounts work, and why we built them that way. We welcome any other feedback you may have."
43921,Scratch Teacher Accounts now Available,9/16/16 12:37,"Hi I think the Teacher Accounts are great and have set up my class. Although I used a csv file to set up username and passwords, the students still had to complete their personal info (age, gender, country etc) themselves. Is it possible for me to include this in the csv so that they skip this step? Thank you!"
43921,Scratch Teacher Accounts now Available,9/18/16 17:57,"I have the same issue in that I don't want my students' work to be visible to the entire community due to their age, lack of parental approval, and privacy.  I also have an additional constraint that students are using Chromebooks and therefore cannot use the offline version.  I have found a potential solution.  I came across a Scatch X version of Scratch that is not supported by Scratch but has been working so far.  It has the same look and all of the features of the on-line Scratch account with the addition of an extension for the Finch robot. The benefits are that 1) It can be used on-line without an account, 2) the students can use it on a chromebook 3) the students can save their work directly to Google Drive.  They can then submit their work to me via Google Classroom or, if you are not using Google classroom, they could share the file with you.  I have not yet tested having to grade all of these but I think it might not be a problem if I download the off-line editor on my Mac. If a student wants to share their work with the community, and gets their parents' permission to create an online Scratch account, they can always upload their Scratch program to that account. Good luck!"
43921,Scratch Teacher Accounts now Available,10/1/16 3:05,"If you go to https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/editor/ you can use the File / Download to Your Computer to save work without an account and File / Upload from Your Computer to load saved work from your computer.

No, there are no tools in Scratch that would allow you to track changes on a project.

43921,Scratch Teacher Accounts now Available,7/17/17 13:55,Hi there! There are a couple ways your students might migrate their projects from a regular account to a student account. The first way would be to download their projects from the regular account and then re-upload them into their newly created student account. Alternatively – and perhaps easier – they can make use of Scratch's remix feature and remix their projects from their regular account to the new student account. Remixes will be saved even if the original project is deleted. I hope this helps!

I have the same problem as George - I want to move students from one class to another. I don't want to have to go through the tedious process of deleting students' accounts, then creating new accounts, with new usernames, for every student, just so I can re-organize the classes that they are all in. From now on, I plan to only create Scratch classes that will be named according to graduation year, so students will just stay in that same class as they move from one year level to the next. But that doesn't solve the problem of those students who are still enrolled in last year's class. I want to tidy things up, but don't want to have to spend lots of time deleting and re-creating student accounts, and confusing students who already have enough trouble remembering current usernames and passwords, without giving them a new one, or chasing up student to get them to delete their own accounts etc. etc. I've used a number of different online platforms for students over the years, and have never encountered one where account management is as cumbersome as it is on Scratch. I'm tempted to just go back to using the offline version of Scratch, which is what I did for years before Scratch teacher accounts became available. But the kids love being able to explore other Scratchers creations, getting inspiration, re-mixing and so on. PLEASE, is there anything that can be done about this??"

The teacher have to make so many global username, or usual ""school-year-class-numbering"" name. How was the architecture for the identification by the special delimiter? (ex. name.class) 3.

11285,"Scratch Team needs help finding ""instruments"" for Scratch 2.0",12/16/11 10:12,"Scratch 1.4 allows Scratchers to create musical projects using the ""set instrument"", ""play note"", and ""play drum"" blocks. These blocks make use of  music synthesizers built into the OS or Java. Unfortunately, for various reasons, Scratch 2.0 can't use those synthesizers, so we have to build our own synthesizer and musical instrument library. We've made a start. To hear the results so far, you can run musical projects  using the Flash-based player on the Scratch website. You'll probably notice that most of our instruments don't sound great. We want to improve both the number and quality of the instruments in Scratch 2.0, and we could use help.

Future considerations for a Tablet?  It currently works on the Android but is not good Next big design effort is to have Scratch work on tablets. Add a Scrolling background - multiple requests v1.4: Currently Scratch works locally on my PC and projects can be uploaded to the Scratch website but I cannot modify a website project’s code dynamically. v2.0:  There is a new “See code” button and a Backpack area See code: Displays code: displays a website project sprite and the code for it’s blocks (methods) in a script area Modify code:  Allow me to dynamically change the the sprite’s code and test it. Backpack Save blocks:  drag the sprite or the code blocks to my backpack area Use blocks: drag the new sprite or code blocks into my project to use Sprite (Object) Custom Blocks (Methods with parameters): Sprites can now create reusable code blocks that can be shared among sprites.  For example a Jump block Make Block : creates a custom block or method that is reuseable Click on Make Block - creates a new Brown custom block Name it Jump Up 10 wait 1 second Down 10 wait 1 second Can drag and drop it Parameter:  To add parameters, Right click on top bar of block New brown Jump block can be dragged to the script area. Share Block between sprites Drag the new Brown Jump block into the backpack click on new sprite drag up to the new sprite’s script section Camera Interface - Video Motion blocks Using the PC camera, the video is full screen covering the entire stage Local motion: Sprite can act up the info and use it to make decisions.  Ex: a balloon senses a hand waving motion and moves to the left or right or “pops”. Global motion - balloon reacts to the general global motion of a person swaying back and forth across the entire screen Cloning Create a clone of a sprite ( Instance) - create a copy of a sprite on the screen (eg. fireworks explode at the same x and y position where you click on a screen or a cat plants a tree and moves 10 steps forward. Clone is created and positioned at the same x and y position  on the stage based on the center of the calling sprite’s or the mouse. Example:  A Cat plants trees that grow and move 10 steps Cat block - Plant a tree repeat create clone of tree move 50 steps wait Tree Clone command: Grow a tree Clone startup block set size to 10% repeat 90 change size by 1 wait 0.1 seconds Create multiple instance of the Tree object on the stage Paint Editor for Vector Graphics - This is difficult to make it “easy to use” and it is currently buggy manipulates vector and bitmap graphics create objects Layers: objects are on separate layers move objects with arrow pointer import vector and bitmap graphics Cloud Variables write and remember a global variable on a website, which can be used for a group survey or the highest score Every user who visits the site is given and anonymous ID number and the system keeps track of who visits the site so you can limit everyone to vote only once.  The ID number was implemented for privacy issues. Note: Scratch website is an open environment and doesn’t allow “private groups” to avoid “unacceptable behavior” so private groups are not allowed.

With Scratch, this is how I aproached it. If the students have a personal email, I encouraged them to get their own Scratch account (with their parents'/guardians' permission), but for those who do not yet have their own email, I am uploading their projects for them through my account. (Some of my 8th grade students do have their own accounts, but most of the younger students do not.) The students are saving their work to the school network. From there, I display projects on the SMARTboard for group discussion and as a class we share(upload) them online through my computer. We also have downloaded some projects from the website to the school network through my account and the students are beginning to learn about remixing. When posting information to be shared publicly, I cautioned the students to be mindful of revealing personal information.

26530,Scratch with WeDo on Linux -- distro-specific issues,4/6/14 20:30,"Hello folks, I am a middle-school teacher working on integrating ?Scratch with LEGO WeDo systems, on Linux. (I have previously used Scratch+WeDo on Windows, but I'm hoping to start using Linux so that I can re-purpose old computers, plus encourage more educators and parents to try Linux with kids.) BUT...I am having trouble, I think, getting the LEGO WeDo USB connection to be recognized consistently through Linux. I have recently obtained a Raspberry Pi, which came with a Raspbian distro (Debian Wheezy) , and the included Scratch 1.4 version worked right away with the WeDo USB connection. Yay! However, not so much luck with another version of Linux on some laptops that I tried. Boo. As you may know, in Scratch, there are some special functions (program blocks) that interact with the WeDo motor and sensors through the special WeDo USB hub. The documentation that I can find says that Scratch will show these special function blocks only when the WeDo USB hub is active/recognized. (One can force-display the blocks through a menu option, but that doesn't necessarily mean they'll work). I installed the Ubermix (Ubuntu) distro on 2 old-ish Dell Latitude D610's, and the WeDo USB connection does NOT seem to be working/recognized on either laptop. (The special blocks do not appear in Scratch 1.4, nor does any sensor or motor work, even if I make the blocks appear by using the menu, then put them in a program. And yes, I tried both motor and sensors, & all of the USB ports.) Anyone got clues to help me? Maybe I should just try another kid-friendly distro? (Anyone tried Edubuntu or DoudouLinux?) I figure it's  USB drivers or hardware config or permissions or something, but I am NOT at all an expert with Linux and I don't have that much time. I can edit config files, etc, if I have instructions. I also have a few Linux-loving friends who I can call upon if needed, but I'd like to have first done whatever research I can. (*see below)  Also, I cannot really ?advocate ?for other teachers to try this if it's not fairly easy. but if there is a fairly simple fix, I'd be happy to help make sure it gets spread around.

(Maybe there's something you already know or did or take for granted if you're familiar with Ubuntu? I recall there perhaps being some issue with the ""plugdev"" group in some other part of system settings?) I can't justify spending the time on new installs just to see if it works right now (plus I don't have access to the aformentioned Dell laptops over the summer; they are checked in at school). On a related note, however, I had a student who wanted to install Linux on a small hand-me-down ""netbook"" or ""notebook"" type of computer (Acer something). We decided to try out Linux Mint (MATE desktop). It turned out to be pretty popular among the kids, super easy & quick to install from USB, worked on a number of devices and -- guess what -- the WeDo integration with Scratch JUST WORKED right away, with no tweaking whatsoever! So here's the conclusion for anyone wading through this thread, hoping to get WeDo - Scratch integration working on a new Linux install, plus a recommendation for a good starter distro for middle-school education: Try Linux Mint! BTW Kevin, I agree that Scratch is preferable for a number of reasons. If I was not using (and our school hadn't already paid for) the ""Activity Pack"" that runs within the WeDo software interface, I might try doing a whole class from Scratch."

26530,Scratch with WeDo on Linux -- distro-specific issues,7/28/14 10:55,"wrt to your last paragraph, I am in a similar situation.  I am somewhat locked-in at the moment with the Lego software + Win7.  The Lego software isn't that bad and actually warming up to it.  I just find the Scratch learning curve to have a more natural flow to it.  I also prefer Linux, whenever possible, on PC hardware with low performance. You've discovered one of the major annoyances between the different flavors of Linux-based OSes: udev, aka Linux Dynamic Device Management.  For some details from the Debian site: https://wiki.debian.org/udev Out of the box, each Linux flavor seems to have different security policies regarding what a typical user can plug in to the PC and immediately operate without Admin privs.  Strict security is general a good thing but it tends to get in the way when tinkering with hardware.  It's good you found Mint. FYI, I recently tried a community update to Scratch 1.4 for operating two motors on Linux.  Works great so far."

Good luck with that. Sounds like you just have to use Scratch, not teach them how to use it? I hope so because you don't have enough time to teach ""how to"" You could demo it but even that takes time, space, etc. Without a clear definition of what ""word language"" means, it is an exercise in futility. On the other hand, if you have been given this task by someone who is faking Scratch knowledge, it shouldn't be too hard to get creative and come up with something that looks good. I Google ""word language"" but didn't see anything remotely helpful but only looked at one page of results. Sorry."

Luego, usando las piezas de Lego WeDo y los recursos tomados de la caja recreábamos la historia usando Scratch, y finalmente pasabamos frente al grupo y mostrabamos el producto programado mientras contábamos nuestra historia. De esa manera hacíamos la conexión entre el mundo físico y el virtual, pues lo que sucedía fuera de la máquina con los personajes había sido programado y se generaba dentro de ella. Saludos, Oscar"

We're huge fans of Scratch, and are running a number of Scratch programming classes this fall. We're currently working on an educational software tool called BlocksCAD, a drag-and-drop 3D CAD and modeling tool designed for elementary schoolers, partly inspired by the success we've seen kids have with Scratch. We've already had great success teaching math and programming skills to elementary students in grades 3 and above, while motivating them with the ability to design 3D printable objects. We want to make it freely available so kids will be able to use it in the classroom or at home. To that end, we recently launched a Kickstarter campaign to fund open sourcing BlocksCAD and further development. Here is a link to our page: http://www.einsteinsworkshop.com/blockscad We'd love to get feedback from the Scratch community, and are looking for ways to help spread the word. Thanks!"

We met in the brand new Makerspace and spacious adjoining rooms. We kicked off the day with informal networking over coffee, bagels and fruit.  Sue Cusack of the Lesley University/Kennedy-Longfellow Tech Project welcomed us to the space. Who are you? : Each attendee filled out a “who am I” poster with a self-portrait and three things about themselves. These were posted to a wall for all to see.  We then organized into lines and did 3 minute one-on-one introductions with people we hadn’t met. Agenda co-creating: The participants were challenged to co-create the schedule for the day by first, brainstorming ideas on idea stickies in small groups.  Ingrid and Janet then rapidly grouped all the ideas and came up with our session topics for the day. Breakout Sessions: We had time for two 45 minute sessions with three topics in each.  Rosemary led a game project for those interested in getting started with Scratch.  Another group met around Math and Science ideas for Scratch and used Muazzez’s project  to look into how we can implement tallies using a counting variable. A third group worked with the WeDo kits building their own chain reaction based on the Scratch + Lego WeDo Chain Reaction video. Lunch Discussion: Ingrid shared the Creative Computing Curriculum Website. Janet shared some resources on ScratchEd including the Student Handbook for Scratch and ECS. Adam shared a WeDo demonstration from his breakout session. Announcements and Resources: Our Google+ Community is launched.

I've always wanted a way to make quick ""galleries"" of student work, for reviewing at the end of a project together, or for assessing their learning on my own time. I put together a simple website that anyone with a Google account can use to create a gallery.  Share the link with your students, and they can add their own Scratch projects to the gallery.  You'll see their full names, but everyone else sees just their initials. The website is free and published under a CC license.  Right now, it's in an alpha state, but I'd welcome feedback from anyone who cares to use it.

26182,ScratchJr: Coding for Young Kids,3/19/14 4:41,Thank you so much for making this announcement! I'll make sure to spread the word in my workshop at the Big bang-konference this week in Denmark. Perfect timing:)
26182,ScratchJr: Coding for Young Kids,3/19/14 13:59,This is great news!! I cannot wait to see it in action!
26182,ScratchJr: Coding for Young Kids,3/20/14 22:47,"Congrats on successful funding with kickstart.  I am a backer.  I am wondering if there will be a desktop version of Scratch Jr.  I understand why you are making Scratch Jr first for the ipad and I see you looking to extended it to Androids, however In my lab I do not have tablets.  I have been campaining to get lab tablets but without success.  I am hoping you will consider making Scratch Jr accessiable to all platforms. Thanks!"
26182,ScratchJr: Coding for Young Kids,3/20/14 23:00,"Thanks for your support of ScratchJr! After iPad and Android, we hope to work on a web-based version (but I'm not sure of timetable)."
26182,ScratchJr: Coding for Young Kids,5/14/14 1:32,Are you launching ScratchJr on Scratch Day this year? I am looking forward to coding with ScratchJr. Keep up the great work!
26182,ScratchJr: Coding for Young Kids,5/24/14 21:18,We plan to launch the iPad version of ScratchJr sometime this summer. Thanks for your interest!
26182,ScratchJr: Coding for Young Kids,7/2/14 6:40,"hello, Will Scratch Jr be released at the scratch@MIT conference this year?"
26182,ScratchJr: Coding for Young Kids,7/3/14 9:01,We are hoping to release ScratchJr (for the iPad) sometime in July -- so it will be available before the Scratch@MIT conference in August. Thanks for your interest in ScratchJr!
26182,ScratchJr: Coding for Young Kids,7/4/14 19:31,Sounds great!  Looking forward to it. Will we get a notification that it has been released?
26182,ScratchJr: Coding for Young Kids,7/6/14 10:06,Could/should Scratch Jr be translated multilingual? Or maybe it´s not necessary...
26182,ScratchJr: Coding for Young Kids,7/6/14 13:01,"The ScratchJr programming blocks do not have any text, so they do not need any translation. But the help and information screens are currently only in English. We hope to translate them eventually, but not in time for the initial release. Also, the user-generated text (e.g., for ""talk balloons"" and titles) does not support multiple language character sets at this time. We hope to support other language character sets in the future."
26182,ScratchJr: Coding for Young Kids,7/9/14 6:01,"Hi Mitch ! Congrats! I think that starting with a simple, graphic and  almst intuitive version version of scratch casn help young learners to familiarize with scratch and the thinking processes that later will be developed at a higher level with full scratch . But the most important thing will be that teachers (not just IT teachers or geeks like me ) will be introduced to scratch in a playful way and learn about coding  without being afraid. Once we , common teachers, realize of what happens inside our student's little heads  while they ""play"" with scratch and how this will improve their learning in other areas, then coding will take the role in deserves in the school curriculum. Thank You!"

26182,ScratchJr: Coding for Young Kids,1/8/15 11:59,"New to ScratchJr., Scratch and ScratchEd.  Teaching ScratchJr. starting next week to my students.  Would appreciated any tips but mostly I wanted to know why you cannot import images as characters or backgrounds. Also there is no eraser in the Paint Editor. Help!"
26182,ScratchJr: Coding for Young Kids,7/9/16 18:05,"Colour me in the same camp as Lori.  I've just started working with Scratch Jr and the kids want to add their own characters to their narratives.  Is this doable?  How? Love the program, but I can see me migrating my kids to Scratch proper pretty soon as they bump up against the limitations of Scratch jr."
26182,ScratchJr: Coding for Young Kids,7/9/16 19:54,"In ScratchJr, you can create characters in the paint editor -- which includes the ability to grab images from the camera. So you can take a photo of the classroom or the playground, and use it as the background for your ScratchJr story. Or you can take a photo of someone's face and put it inside the head of a ScratchJr character. But if you want to import an image from the web or another app, you'll need to switch to Scratch."

It's a pity we can't stay at MIT Dorms this year (at least I found no refernece to the option). Cambridge / Boston hotels are heavy priced so I followed the suggestion of Derek Breen to book with a youth hostel  Six nights (August 1-7) are much cheaper than a single night at the Kendall Marriot.

26890,ScratchNYC Meetup Notes,4/28/14 12:49,"Hi everyone, Here is an example of what I was talking about when I said I need other teachers for collaboration! Right now this is a drawing project with a finger and Leap Motion. We are using the offline Scratch 2.0. It draws and draws then all of sudden it starts making sharp straight lines when you move the finger instead of what the finger is doing. We are baffled. Has anyone else had similar trouble? One of my students figured out that a hand keeps a connection with the Leap Motion better than a finger but in another game being built, two fingers work to move two characters in a game but two hands cause confusion as they overlap too easily. All thoughts, collaborations will be appreciated!"

I created the site scratchprogramming.org (An educators guide to scratch programming) as a project for my Masters Degree in Educational technology. I need some people to fill out a survey on the usefullness and functionality of the site I have up now. www.scratchprogramming.org The survey is the system usability scale (SUS) , which is a simple, ten-item attitude, multiple choice question scale.(Strongly Agree to Strongly Disagree). Access to the survey is available on the homepage. I hope the site is helpful to those wanting to use Scratch as a tool for teaching. Thanks Julian."

Since I have worked with Scratch for 8 months now - I could not really use your web site, but I like the idea that you share thoughts about how to teach Scratch. If you have the time and skills maybe you should think about incorporating some social system, maybe a blog or something where others can contribute to your site."

314,"Screencasts, publish on YouTube?",7/13/09 13:07,"Hi all. It’s great to see this Web site. I am considering using YouTube to host a series of Scratch tutorial screencasts (created from ScreenFlow on a Mac). I have one video there now which gives a quick overview of my teaching with Scratch, Alice, Python and Pygame. How do you publish your tutorial videos? Care to share any details such as software, screen resolution, video codecs used, etc.? I find so far that the quality on YouTube (even at “HD”) is not as good as the QuickTime mov file I produce from ScreenFlow, but I can read the Scratch blocks pretty well. Dave Briccetti Lafayette, California"

He posted them on YouTube, if you'd like to check them out: http://www.youtube.com/user/SHEAH909 I'm pretty sure he used Adobe Captivate to do the recordings... I recently purchased ScreenFlow. What do you think of it? Thanks, K"
314,"Screencasts, publish on YouTube?",7/13/09 23:55,"I just watched a few. Very good. I’ll tell my students about them. So far I think ScreenFlow is excellent. I haven’t done much fancy zooming in and out and things. I tend to make large videos, and do it in one take."
314,"Screencasts, publish on YouTube?",7/27/09 5:25,"As the Young Programmers podcast is getting more popular, I’m starting to make the ScreenFlow screencasts smaller, but zooming in on the relevant bits. Video files are much smaller now. I’ve also learned the right QuickTime encoding settings (framerate, keyframes, etc.) for these types of screencasts, and that makes a huge differencet too."
314,"Screencasts, publish on YouTube?",7/27/09 19:38,"Ah, that's great! Would you be willing to share the encoding settings? :)"
314,"Screencasts, publish on YouTube?",8/1/09 14:09,"Sure. I use H.264, unless I am supporting an older version of QuickTime (I didn’t anticipate making the videos this summer and so didn’t upgrade the QuickTime in our lab), in which case I use MPEG-4. If there is no video (a talking head, for example) in the screencast, then a frame rate of 10–15 is good enough. Key Frames: Automatic. Frame Reordering: True. Data Rate: Automatic. Compressor Quality Medium to High, and Encoding: Best (Multi-pass). Audio: Mono. I sometimes lower the sample rate to 22.05 kHz (especially if it’s just human voices). Mono, unless there is other than a single person talking on one channel. I look forward to seeing your results. Dave"

9436,Second year of Scratch in Moodle,3/31/11 2:34,"Just finished my second year working with my Scratch unit in Moodle. Our session this year ran a full nine weeks. I had some pretty good projects and a lot of ... well, unfinished projects, (lack of completion of work in all subjects seems to be school-wide, so I wouldn't blame Scratch). Because of Scratch and Moodle abilities to enable students to work together, I had my first cooperative project that two boys were able to complete despite being in two different classes. I posted what I thought were our best projects on my class pages. As I have emptied all student data/work out of my class, I have created a user that members of ScratchED can use to log on and look at the course. My course is not perfect, it needs updating and reconfiguring, changes I made this year helped the flow of the course, but I know I can do better. It is also structured for a course that can be posted on our Blackboard portal, (all schools in NM have access to a Blackboard portal), hopefully I can put it on Blackboard next year, (I love Moodle, but I would rather teach than maintain a server when I don't have to). Moodle Site: http://www.chaparralmiddle.us/moodle/login/index.php ID: tempuser Password: tempuser1 I am open to any suggestions for improving the unit.

19465,"Seeking a Scratch ""expert"" to help with staff training",6/15/13 20:11,"Hello ScratchEd members! My name is Joe Young, I am a Teen Services Library Assistant at Hercules Public Library in Hercules, CA.  I am currently working on a grant proposal to fund a Creative Computing class at my library; one aspect of the program I am proposing would be staff training by a Scratch expert to help other library staff in my organization develop Creative Computing classes at their community libraries.  Does this project sound like something you would like to participate in?  We would, of course, provide a fee for the staff training session and take care of any travel arrangements that would be necessary. A little information about my library:  Contra Costa County Library is a public library system that provides services to residents of California state.  There are 26 community libraries and patrons can access a variety of resources and materials online as well.  The county itself is a primarily suburban county in the San Francisco Bay area, with slightly over one million residents as of the 2010 census. Regarding the proposed training:  We would be aiming for a Winter 2013 or Spring 2014 date for the training.  We would like to host the training in a centralized location in the county to allow for interested staff from all branches to be able to attend.  Depending on the cost associated with the training, we may be interested in scheduling multiple training sessions.  The purpose of the training would be for staff to develop enough skill with Scratch to be able to use the program, either in conjunction with the Scratch Curricululm Guide or independantly, to implement a Creative Computing class at their community library.  We are looking for an individual with a high level of proficiency using the Scratch program in an educational setting who would feel comfortable providing instruction to a group of 15-20. If you are interested in this opportunity please feel free to contact me at jyoung@ccclib.org; please title your email ""scratch expert for staff training"" and be sure to include, in the body of the email, the fee you would ask to provide training sessions and what travel arrangements would be necessary to accomadate you (if any).

46759,"Seeking pilot schools for CSJumpstartr, a Scratch ""content templates"" offering",1/10/17 12:22,"Hi ScratchEd folks: We're looking for help from teachers of grades 4-6 in the greater Boston area, to pilot a Scratch-related curriculum product. (http://www.csjumpstartr.com/schools) More info: A collaborator and I - both Scratch enthusiasts in informal-ed settings - have been working on a Scratch-based product we call CSJumpstartr. The driving purpose is to make it easier for teachers (and homeschool parents) use Scratch for ""show what you know"" projects in existing curriculum units, without themselves needing to teach coding. CSJumpstartr is a self-contained build of the open-source Scratch 2.0 editor and a collection of templates for content projects (slideshows, quizzes, poster-boards, etc.) with integrated step-by-step guidance delivered in the browser. Each template is supported by PDF worksheets, documentation, and ""take it further"" challenges. Kids can work through completing a template independently, so the teacher can integrate the project into an existing curriculum without needing to teach coding too. Using our templates, kids with no Scratch experience can create a finished project; and kids with more experience and/or a penchant for tinkering can expand on the template. We know there are a lot of teachers who would like to integrate creative coding, but they face barriers like lack of curricular flexibility, or lack of expertise, or lack of IT support. We think our approach can help, by supporting teachers to use Scratch to deliver traditional end-of-unit summary projects.  We'd love it if our product resulted in Scratch getting used in more schools by more teachers. In that vein, we are looking for teachers and schools - ideally in the Boston area - who are interested in piloting CSJumpstartr with 4th to 6th graders. We'd get you set up and advise you on implementation, and in return we'd ask for feedback and ideas for improvement. If you're interested, please get in touch with me here on ScratchEd or via our website (http://www.csjumpstartr.com/schools).

9791,Sensors,5/23/11 21:10,I'm looking for advice about how to get started with sensors for a high school class. Which ones - what context?
9791,Sensors,5/24/11 11:49,"Susan, I think you should start by using the existing sensors in the Scratch board (light, sound, slider and button). I wrote a few one-page documents to get people started with sensors. You may find the useful: - http://scratched.media.mit.edu/resources/make-car-go-faster - http://scratched.media.mit.edu/resources/make-your-own-puppet I also recommend the getting started with Pico Boards document (available in this link http://www.picocricket.com/pdfs/Getting_Started_With_PicoBoards.pdf) Best of luck!

I have two classes of 5th graders who created individual scratch projects to animate diagrams of plant and animal cells. They drew sprites for each part of the cell and created scripts so a label will appear and voice read aloud the name of each part as it is clicked. They were really excited about the project and I would like to let students share it with a larger audience, but to add their projects individually on the Scratch site would require me to get get permission from 48 parents.

Has anyone developed a solution for this? Pam"

Then I created a Scratch account for any classroom.  I named them   ""rayschool23"" for Room 23. Before they came in to class to post their completed projects as a final step; I changed the password to 232323.  They can then post their projects, and when they leave, I change it back to my patterned password  (23xxxxxx, say, put what you want instead of xxxxxx) I encourage them to get individual accts. at home with their parents' help.  I was working with 5th graders. For 2nd and 3rd graders, I just posted their projects and put up links to them. see: http://rayschool.org/pinksheet/2010/03/25/third-grade-haiku/ http://rayschool.org/room15 for example Let me know if you have any questions"

I’m Christan Balch, the Online Community Coordinator on the Scratch Team at MIT. We understand your frustration with the registration process for students, and we’re sorry for the difficulties that it has caused for you and your students. We’re continuing to work on Teacher Accounts, which we hope will simplify the process of creating accounts for your students. Unfortunately, the development of the Teacher Accounts has taken much longer than we expected. We hope to have more news about the accounts soon. We’ll make sure to post messages on ScratchEd to keep you informed. In the meantime, we suggest using a single email address (e.g., a teacher’s email address) to register and approve all of your student accounts. (Multiple Scratch accounts can share the same address.) We realize that the confirmation process can be time-consuming for educators, but confirmation is just a one-time process when first registering an account. Sorry again for the current difficulties. We hope to have better solutions in the future. Please do feel free to reach out to me should you have more questions."" Best, Willa, on behalf of the ScratchEd Team"

I am now starting my phd which will be in the area of games based learning.  I am interested in how Scratch fits in with the new Scottish curriculum for excellence and want to explore this more as it can be used for a variety of learning outcomes other than computing - maths/english/art to name some. I am also interested in the affective impact of Scratch - my honours project showed that Scratch was enjoyed week after week by the children in school and very rarely did anyone not enjoy a lesson.  It also showed that the children did make some small steps in learning about programming, given my timescale I felt it was a great achievement as i only had 8 hours of lessons with them.

My doctoral dissertation was supported by the Spencer Foundation to work with Dr. Yasmin Kafai at UCLA and focused on using Scratch as a platform for interactive media-art-making. We worked with the folks at the MIT Media Lab to develop and test the first versions of Scratch at an after-school center, called the Computer Clubhouse, in South Los Angeles. Originally, Scratch was designed for the Computer Clubhouse Network to engage youth in programming via media mixing. Much of the research is still ongoing but many of our  findings have been written up in conference proceedings and research articles. I thought I would list the references below for anyone that's interested. We also have a co-edited book that highlights some of our Scratch-related work titled, The Computer Clubhouse: Constructionism and Creativity in Youth Communities (Teachers College Press, 2009). Additionally, I did my post-doctoral work at UCIrvine with Dr. Mark Warschauer. During this time, I worked with 80 second-graders using Scratch in the classroom.

Currently I am examining middle schoolers' use of Scratch to tell stories.  In the past there have been a series of studies looking at how storytelling can offer kids an entrance into programming (most notably Caitlin Kelleher's work with the introductory language Alice, see http://www.alice.org/kelleher/storytelling/).  I am interested in how storytelling with Scratch can actually offer more than simply a ""ramp"" to get kids interested in programming but also speak back to the writing process itself, teaching kids how to develop a narrative, revise one's work, and put together the basic elements of a story grammar.  I am currently doing research in a middle school in West Philadelphia, using Scratch both inside a language arts classroom as well as in an afterschool club, exploring kids' creations and how they potentially tie into their development as writers. I am very interested in learning what kind of Scratch stories others are creating with kids and what success educators have experienced with introducing Scratch in terms of English/ language arts as well as storytelling.  I am also getting more and more interested in how kids share their stories online at the website and how fanfiction genres (e.g., Harry Potter stories/ Final Fantasy animations) can offer kids a scaffold not only in how to use the Scratch software but also as a means to navigate the website itself and make wider connections online."

For this purpose, I am coordinating a collaborative project involving members of many universities, schools and community organizations who are using Scratch as a tool to express themselves and their ideas.   We are now running a series of workshops with Toyota City Lifelong Learning Center in our local community in which small children, students, adults and elderies in the 70's are collaborating to create Scratch animations based on narrative stories using scanned hand drawings and recorded voice.  In the past years, we ran workshops in which many children and adults from local Brazilian community collaborated with Japanese participants.  We are excited by the possibilities of collaboration of such diverse age and culture groups. We are hoping to connect these local activities with activities around the world.  Right now, most partners are in Japan, except one school in the US and one in Inner-Mongolia in China, and I'm hoping to find more partners from around the world. We have set up a website for this project:  http://sns.or6.jp/school-news/school-news-english , which links to galleries of Scratch projects and activities at various schools (mostly in Japanese).   We are trying to design this website as a gateway for introducing Japanese Scratch users to the users around the world.   It would be wonderful if we can connect this project with similar attempts in other parts of the world. So, this is a research project trying to look at Scratch as embedded in the learning environments including the web, classrooms, people and communities, and to experiment how we can design such learning environment as a whole so that the people involved can learn from each other, because of, not in spite of, the differences in cultures and generations."

I am working with my childrens own school this year and teaching the P4/5 (age 7-9) with Scratch.  I think your project sounds very interesting and the class teacher I am working with has thought so too.  At the moment I am introducing the children to scratch but by after christmas the children will be working on other projects and we would love to join your project.  Sorry i should say we are from a primary school in Glasgow, Scotland. Could you send me some more details please awilson169@gmail.com Amanda"
5978,Share Your Research Interests,11/14/10 19:46,"Hello Amanda Thank you for your interest in our project.  You are of course welcome to join the project! Right now, students in four universities in Japan are collaboratively working to help elementary school children in Japan, USA, and China (Inner-Mongolia) in learning with Scratch.   It is exciting to have a new partner from Scotland!  (I've never been to Scotland although I've visited Nottingham and York in a study tour with my students.) I'll try to describe how we have been collaborating so far.   We usually start by exchanging Scratch projects to introduce our schools and team members to each other.   (Projects are in this gallery: http://scratch.mit.edu/galleries/view/99695)  One such project has recently been selected as a ""featured project"" on the Scratch site and received many interesting comments from all over the world. (http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/h309017/1340424) Then each class (or team in the class) proposes ideas for collaborative Scratch projects.   Other school members look at these ideas and try to team up to work on ideas of common interests.   For example, children in an elementary school in Japan have studied the environment around their school, such as living things in a nearby river, its water quality, the history of recycling in the community, etc.., and would try to express their observations with Scratch animations.  They are just beginning to learn Scratch, so they will first send their drawings of their animation ideas to the university students, who will try to help the children create the animations. Another example is an elementary school near Boston, which is described in this blog post: http://sns.or6.jp/scratch-network-forum/-collaboration-blog/ideas-from-jackson-school-1109?lang=en I think you might be aware of this school and the teacher. Amanda, if you can describe what you would like your students to learn with Scratch, and ideas for collaboration, we can start discussing how to collaborate. Please let me know if you have any questions or suggestions.  I prefer discussing on an open forum like this, but you can email me at mudpie446 at_mark mac.com Yoshiro"

I just tried it to see what would happen -- it creates a separate .txt file for each project, but in each file it does show author and history of saves, etc. It's not quick since you need to download each project to a folder, but once you have them all downloaded, you could generate the text files with that one command. Would that be helpful for what you need? --Sandie p.s. ...and then maybe if you combined the summary parts into one text file, you could use Scratch to read in the text, parse it, keep track of how many projects per author, etc....   Okay, I guess that's not a quick solution!"

I love the FlowGo Hardware (but can't afford a load of them at £99 each) and I don't love the GO software (compared to Scratch :) ) so I've taken the pi-face interface software (July 2012 edition) and modified it so that you can control the GPIO pins on a RaspberryPi and therefore start using Scratch to control external devices as cheaply as possible.

23315,simultaneous vs parallel,10/28/13 13:42,"Since this discussion is named How do I? I will ask, how do I explain, in the context of Scratch, the difference between simultaneous and parallel?"
23315,simultaneous vs parallel,10/31/13 8:10,Parallel processing is the dividing of an application into smaller units of work that can be executed simultaneously. Parallel processing can occur on the same machine or on different machines. You can explain that parallel processing is like a ballet. There is the corps and the principles. The performance begins and ends at the same time. Sometimes they dance at the same time executing their steps together sometimes as a reaction to what the others are doing (think of criss-crossing lines!) you can get some great video from youtube to demonstrate it.

34793,Six 3-hour sessions for 9-14 year olds,6/10/15 13:16,You can defiintely do a lot with SCRATCH - more than CODE.org. Code is good for basic introduction but for middle school students scratch has a lot more to offer. we teach scratch to students in grade 2-5 with our curriculum and there are many times that we wish we could do more advanced projects because scratch has the capability but the students are quite young and we don't have the time. Middle school students with a 3 hour block can ramp up faster and will be able to create more complex programs. Vrinda

7465,Slowness of Loops?,10/21/10 15:37,"I've got 19 kids working on game projects right now and this is a common quirk: Many of them have a ""score"" variable and want to increment the score until it gets to a certain number, like 10, and then have the game advance to the next level. But many of them are finding that the ""score"" variable increments to 12 or 13 before the script stops executing and/or sends a broadcast to trigger the next level. Why is that? Is there a fix?"
7465,Slowness of Loops?,10/21/10 15:39,"Also, what's the best way to do that: repeat until score > 10 {do whatever the game usually does} or forever if score < 11 { do whatever the game usually does} My eyes are bugging out from trying to debug these projects. Thanks!"

7465,Slowness of Loops?,7/14/11 21:10,"This is called a race condition. It's really easy to create them in Scratch, since it is easy to create loops. Multi-threaded programming used to be a ""hard"" topic for advanced programmers. Scratch makes it easy for kids to do it! But it doesn't provide vital tools like semaphores or locks, which other languages that do multi-threading have. The solution is to reduce the number of loops. Instead of three or four different loops, try to combine the actions into one big loop. It's possible to still ""subroutine"" out using broadcasts, but at least control the flow from one loop. Then you won't make yourself crazy trying to debug race conditions. One student was going crazy with debugging his program that had lots of independent loops and used ""on foo key pressed"". He combined his user interaction into one big loop checking ""if foo key pressed"", and got rid of some of the indepenent loops doing sensing stuff, combining them with his loop that checked for user interaction. The game ran MUCH faster and the race conditions stopped."

By that I mean, a lot of people use multiple When Green Flag Clicked blocks in the same sprite's code. This can create confusing errors and make long code hard to debug because you get confused over what part of the code is being executed at any given moment. This would be parallel coding. I encourage people to write all (or at least most) of their sprite's code into a single, long block. It is far easier to make long or complicated code work and to find errors. I call this serial coding. In fact, it is a good idea to use as few When Green Flag Clicked blocks a s possible because too many will confuse Scratch. Use broadcasts for everything except the main loop."

I am looking for a class of students that will collaborate with my class.   We are in Calgary, Canada and would like to do a cultural project with a class of any grade 1 to 12.   We are looking for a class that is in a different country than ours, or that are in eastern Canada (as this is a valuable difference as well). I have collaborated with classrooms around the world before and found it to be an amazing experience for all involved.  This project will be simple.  The project for my grade 5 students will have this is our  guiding question  'What makes us Canadian?""  and the international class would do the same for thier country.  Students in the class would create Scratch projects about significant historical events, people that have had an impact on their country, key ideas...  whtever is in your curriculum. If you are in grade 4 to 12, each student could make a project.  Younger grades may make a project together as a class. A really exciting part is that we would share a Scratch Studio.  The students would communicate to each other through their projects and through comments.   Knowing that there is a groups of studetns from another part of the world that they are working with is tremendously exciting for the students.  They love to show off their own countries.  They also love to make Scratch projects!

I see a few planned Scratch Day events in my region, but nothing close by yet. I would be interested in co-organizing a Scratch Day as well as collaboration on individual Scratch projects. I would also be interested in simply connecting with any ScratchED users in my area. I am just now getting into Scratch as a student and parent. I have previous experience with QBasic in high school, and spent most of my youth running dial-up and telnet BBSs, programming and building MUDs and BBS Door games, and creating/downloading MOD and MIDI songs. I have been exploring technology over the years at an informal pace and am formally switching to an IT track in futures soon. A favorite pasttime lately has been integrating Scratch with MaKey MaKey. I am learning the basics about Arduino, Python, RaspberryPi, 3D printing, a variety of other exciting experiences at my local Makerspace/Hackerspace. I place a lot of value in kinesthetic learning and visual programming languages like Scratch. I like that the spirit of programming and coding is very much a part of Scratch just as the spirit of innovation is captured in MaKey MaKey's open versatility in simplicity. Tools such as Scratch are very positive and fertile atmospheres for both transitioning into more sophisticated and traditional text-based syntax-centric languages while teaching the important basics in a fun way. I have toyed around with remixing, and am looking at picking up pace to delve into more of what Scratch has to offer. I would be interested in collaborating on advanced Scratch projects with others, especially anything that can be turned into a ScratchED resource or has useful academic value. I am currently working on a series of educational curriculum-based games that parody different genres of popular games and could definitely use creative and multi-talented co-conspirators. Also looking for insight and feedback."

1851,Special Education,12/7/09 12:37,"Students with developmental disabilities and emotional/behavioral disorders have few options to develop 21st century skills. I have an 18 year old son who can search for cheat codes on line, sort through the hits, copy the codes and enter them into his game console to change the parameters of his games (zelda, pokemon, final fantasy).  With a game controller in his hands, he can focus for hours.  In class, he can focus for minutes.  The reason he finally learned to read was in order to understand game dialog and walk through game guides.   His game skills have not transferred to any other aspect of his life. I think Scratch (and video gaming) could be doorways into computer literacy for students like my son who populate classrooms/schools separated from the mainstream because of unacceptable behaviors.  His future employment is likely to be cleaning offices or washing windows or shredding paper.  If he worked online, his behaviors would not be an issue.  His fine motor skills are impressive.  He wants to design video games but expects his first effort to look like something from Square Enix or Nintendo. Is anybody teaching Scratch to these students?  (My suspect credibility as Mom makes it hard for me to teach him Scratch --or anything else--at home.)  In a structured setting I think he would really enjoy using Scratch and uploading his projects for feedback would support his interest in becoming a video game designer.  How can we introduce Scratch to Special Education?"

1851,Special Education,12/9/09 11:09,"I have been able to introduce game programming to these kids through  tutoring, and after school programs. I have worked successfully with Scratch and Game Maker. I've had  success with girls using Scratch, but boys  prefer Game Maker . Game Maker is intuitive and looks more like a shooter up video game. On the other hand Scratch really teaches the kids how to program. If you use Scratch, my advice, is to have prepackaged cool Scratch tricks up your sleeve to start. These tricks can demonstrate how cools Scratch is, so no one gets frustrated with how difficult it is. Both communities have great online presence. Scratch's presence is a more appropriate and kid friendly environment. Game Maker is more graphic, but still Jacob Hapgood does a great job with keeping his program free and updated. I work a lot with Asperger kids, who love computing and I have found that whatever programming environment you put in front of them, they will do great things, without much guidance. Last but not least, the one trick that has been tremendously successful is to have the more advanced students tutor the less advanced students. Everyone likes this. In general, I teach Computer Science in High School using Game Maker, REALBasic, and java. I'm still trying to get Scratch to be taught in the lower grades. It's an uphill battle."

We can not get their project to start back at the beginning when they open the document. I'll use the Tamika example to try to explain what I mean. When you open the file, it always starts with the letters in a line, with a solid black background. Once you click on the green flag, each letter moves leaving a color trail. When you stop or restart it always continues with the colors over the black; however if you close the file and reopen it, you start over -- letters in a line with the black stage. Every time my students close and then reopen their file, they get exactly what they had when they stopped. What needs to be done so that it always starts at the beginning the file is first opened.

16001,Starting at the beginning?,1/23/13 16:53,If I am understanding you correctly... The Tamika script has two scripts for each letter sprite both of which are activated when the green flag is clicked. One sets the intial position (go to x:  y:  ) in a line at the top.

54452,Sticky Notes in Scratch,2/7/18 10:56,"I saw in someone's Three Little Pigs project that they had added sticky notes next to their code writing notes about what that code was supposed to do.  I think that's a great idea, but I don't see how to add them to my project.  Where do you find sticky notes?"
54452,Sticky Notes in Scratch,2/9/18 9:53,"Hi Kerry! I believe this will teach you how to post the stickey notes! Here is the transcribed information from Scratch Wiki: Comments in the Scratch program are adjustable textboxes that can be attached to blocks, or left floating. The comment boxes can be adjusted both horizontally and vertically, dragged around the Scripts Area, and deleted. In a survey conducted by the Scratch Team, which tried to identify the top scripts used by Scratchers, the comment block (which was accidentally found by the survey engine due to technical reasons) ranked 10th, is 0.68% of all scripts on the website. To add a comment to a block, right-click it, and in the drop-down menu choose ""add comment"". This will add a yellow box in which you can type your comment. Comments can be added anywhere in the Scripts Area the same way. In 2.0, comments are created by right-clicking. If you right-click on a block, the comment will be connected by a (very) thin line to that block. If you right-click on the stage, the comment will not be connected to anything. You can edit or delete a comment by right-clicking on it. Mini comments are one line long and hold the amount of characters that will fit on one width of the comment. Change from Mini to Full by clicking the triangle at the top left of the comment. Full comments display all text entered into it, which can extend infinitely. The width (size) of comments can be altered by clicking (the parallel lines at) the bottom right-hand corner of the comment and dragging to the desired width (size). This can also be extended infinitely and is particularly useful if the mini comment is too narrow to display a sufficient amount of characters. I hope this is helpful! Best, Alexa"

Right(string, n) - Allows you to return the right most n characters of a string, e.g. Right(""Scratch"",3) will return tch. Mid(string, start, n) - Allows you to return a specific part of a string, e.g. Mid(""Scratch Programming"", 9, 7) will return Program from the string. ToUpperCase(string) - Allows you to convert a string to upper case. e.g. ToUpperCase(""scratch"") will return SCRATCH and ToLowerCase(""SCRATCH"") will return scratch.

I’m Christan Balch, the Online Community Coordinator on the Scratch Team at MIT. We understand your frustration with the registration process for students, and we’re sorry for the difficulties that it has caused for you and your students. We’re continuing to work on Teacher Accounts, which we hope will simplify the process of creating accounts for your students. Unfortunately, the development of the Teacher Accounts has taken much longer than we expected. We hope to have more news about the accounts soon. We’ll make sure to post messages on ScratchEd to keep you informed. In the meantime, we suggest using a single email address (e.g., a teacher’s email address) to register and approve all of your student accounts. (Multiple Scratch accounts can share the same address.) We realize that the confirmation process can be time-consuming for educators, but confirmation is just a one-time process when first registering an account. Sorry again for the current difficulties. We hope to have better solutions in the future. Please do feel free to reach out to me should you have more questions."" I hope this helps! Best, Willa"

18473,Student Accounts?,5/14/13 11:43,I teach 7th grade so my students are 12 (some 13). I'm wondering what other teachers are doing for their students at this age--are they letting them set up an online account in the Scratch community? Are there any safeguards so that random people can't contact them privately? I'd like my students to be able to remix but I have reservations about letting them sign up for accounts. Thanks for any suggestions.
18473,Student Accounts?,5/14/13 15:05,"You might be interested in this earlier discussion. Also, there will be ""teacher account"" features available later this year (as described in the recent Scratch 2.0 webinar)."
18473,Student Accounts?,5/20/13 21:21,"What I do is so simple you could call it naive, but it has worked well for several years for my 2nd-6th graders.  We use each student's first name followed by a fake short last name similar to our school name.  So if you teach at George Washington Elementary School, your students could be BettyWash, RobertWash, etc.  I also compounded three simple but unrelated words to make a ten-character password that is easy to remember.  I encourage students not to change the password so that I can access their account if I need to, but I don't insist on that. So far, there have not been any real problems doing that. especially with Scratch 2.0 . I suppose that students could hack one another's accounts and disrupt things in other ways, but it has not happened and I'll cross that bridge when I come to it.  Meanwhile, life is easy doing this. When we first started doing Scratch, some parents did express some concerns.  That was a bit tense, but I ended up making up a permission slip and giving each parent and child the option of opting out or just using special one-time accounts within the classroom.  However, at that point, all of the parents gave permission to do things as I had outlined and we've just gone on from there. I think the really big factor that makes this work is the amount of thought and effort the Scratch team has done to make this a safe constructive environment for kids.  The recent additions to make sure credit is given for remixing projects is just one more step in that directions.  Kudos.

2477,Student Learning,1/29/10 17:04,"I have seen many Scratch projects recently in which students are doing great work, but I am not convinced that the students deeply know the underlying programming concepts. I am afraid that students may ""do"" but may not really ""know."" What should students ""know"" as a result of playing with and learning Scratch? How do we know that they know besides looking at a program that they create? Are there other ways to assess their learning? What questions should we be asking/investigating? I really want students to internalize the powerful programming elements that are available with Scratch and am looking for ways to make that happen. Any ideas or suggestions are welcome!"
2477,Student Learning,1/30/10 19:20,"Considering your question of when or how to introduce/go deeper with programming ideas, as an elementary teacher without programming background, I appreciate Scratch specifically because it gives me and my students access without requiring the deep knowledge you reference.   In a game-making elective with 4-6th graders last fall, I did go to the Design Team's handout of concepts embedded in Scratch and tried out referencing some of them every so often.  I have to say, I expected the kids to feel cool about using a term like ""sequencing,""  or ""conditional statment"" but instead they weren't terribly interested in the big words, this group any way.  They could do the processes, as shown by their projects and their ability to help others when stuck, and that was what was interesting to them.  You have me thinking more about how naming what they are doing and helping them categorize their processes fits in. This topic is close to one a group of us is meeting on-line to discuss on February 7.  If you are interested in joining in, send me a message."
2477,Student Learning,2/1/10 7:45,"Hi David, I share your approach; I want the students to understand the concepts. That doesn't mean knowing the ""big words"", as Karen puts it, but being able to apply the concepts in new situations. Some minimal terminology is still necessary, I think, in order to enable students to help others and explain what they have been doing. Terms such as ""conditional statement"" are for the teacher, the students could be taught to simply call it ""if-block"". Now, how to make sure that they have understood the concepts? I'm currently preparing a course where I will try the following: I'm preparing a game where all sprites except the hero are already fully programmed. The students must program the hero themselves. Every level is clearly associated with one concept, and in order to get through the level, students must program the hero according to this concept. Example: a taxi arrives, and the hero must board it. Solution: go to taxi in a forever loop. The taxi in turn checks whether the hero indeed comes along when the taxi pulls out. The necessary new  concept at this point (forever loop) is learned through a specific handbook chapter which explains it and contains exercises.  The idea is that the ""master exercise"" (get through the level) acts as a focus: during the regular exercises, students can play and try this and that, but to get through the level, they really need to understand and apply one particular concept, otherwise it's ""Game Over"".  In order to avoid that students blindly copy their solutions from the regular exercises, there is always a little twist that they discover only when the game goes on. In the taxi case, the taxi stops at some point, the hero must get out and reach a specific entrance area on the stage.  For this, they need to rewrite their forever loop into a repeat-until-key-pressed loop (same handbook chapter), sequenced with a goto x y (previous handbook chapter). I have no experience with this setup yet; all I can say already is that the programming effort on my side is rather high (but it's fun...). If it works out well, I will certainly share the resources."

I have throughout the past 3 years during my undergraduate studies and now phd been researching in Primary Schools (Elementary school) with Scratch and getting the children to create their own games. however the aim of this is ideally to enable the class teachers to teach Scratch and game making (Game design is a part of the Computing Science Curriculum within Scotland). now that I hav eundertaken pilot studies in school I am now preparing teachers to teach the 8 lesson game making course totheir students (ages 8-11) and am creating a teacher guide for them. However what I was wondering is do any educators have any Frequently asked questions from students they would like to share? Personally I have noticed a pattern and in fact on 2 questions crop up time after time. I would like others to share their experiences though in order to compare.

One third of the class finds my pace too slow (and wants more challenges—which I try to give individually), another third find it too fast (and wants more explanations—which I try to give/repeat to the entire group whenever I can) and the final third seems to find my pace to their liking. 2. Some students want me to solve every problem for them (which is not going to happen). 3. Errors are bound to appear in some student projects because of the way a student used their blocks. I try to have other students help problem solve, because it can be time intensive. 4. I require my students to spend time creating sprites and backgrounds, which can give me some time to analyze code. 5. Unknown errors will appear and disappear in some student projects for no logical reason."

Currently I'm creating ""classes"" of students for each grade level so that they can use their account multiple years in a row and have access to them in more than one environment.  Ex:  ""Class of 2022"", etc. I have a feeling that creating different studios for each classroom environment is going to be the fix that I find, but I'm wondering if someone else has encountered this.

This is something we've suggested in the past and I think that it would work well for the needs you are describing. If you do not want to use studios and/or each Teacher wants to have students in their own, unique classroom, another possible option would be to make use of the remix feature.

10017,"Students with disabilities, Supporting literacy",6/28/11 13:34,"Karen, I of course I would love to talk to you. I have just begun writing up my findings, and today I wrote this letter of introduction that you might be interested in. This is just the very beginning of my work. I will send me an email and perhaps we can talk. I want to collect statistics (hence your book) etc. I had been a computer programmer for many years and after TA-ing at Harvard Extension, for a friend, in Distributed Java I decided to switch careers and retrain as a teacher. At the age of 53, I found my vocation. I retrained at Harvard Extension with Sue being my premier teacher while I earned my Instructional technology licensure. Six years later, I teach a Basic Programming and Game Making course, an introduction to Object Oriented/ Java course which includes a summation game component, and an AP Java Exam course at Marshfield High School. During my first year of teaching, I was fortunate to have a bright and talented student on the autistic spectrum. I immediately saw the compelling connection between students on the spectrum and computer programming.  Although programming is thought of as a solitary act, it can be the student’s first positive social experience, and indeed, can serve as a potential and viable career path. I immediately spoke with the Marshfield School district head of Special Education, Ms. Susan Dupuis, and within minutes had an after-school Marshfield Kid’s Konnection class teaching (MIT’s Scratch programming environment) to special needs students from kids 8 to 12. In addition, I began tutoring students wanting extra guidance. My work with the students on the spectrum has been very gratifying and successful. For six years now, I have been teaching high school computer programming classes, running private classes, and holding tutoring session, and have watched with great gratification and satisfaction students exceed all academic expectations, and enjoy social possibilities never expected from programming experiences. I am working with the Scratch team and am in the process of writing my complete findings. Young talented autistic students find a comfort zone and interest they had not found before.  These students go from invisible students to Marshfield icons through their work that transform them into game-making super-stars.  The affordances do not stop there; the younger students that I work with Scratch discover a new medium that captures their interest in a way that is so all consuming that it is fascinating to watch.  A serious young student of 12 that I have worked with for three years best describes my work with less talented autistic students. Interestingly, his enthusiasm for Scratch is not daunted by his lack of progress or (at least my definition of progress). He has always kept his work private, and I was forbidden to post his work to my Web site. During this Scratch Day at MIT by the time I sat down, he had proudly showed his work to his father and the entire table. I was flabbergasted and delighted, walked away with the assurance that he and his dad did not need my help. I wish I could say my efforts to get a Scratch component taught in the lower grades have been successful, but for 6 years I have advocated and been turned down by the administration. Therefore, I have chosen to put my efforts into integrating Scratch in all school Special Education units where they are more receptive, and in all honesty, where I personally get the most satisfaction. I could go on but I think you have read quite enough already. I have two Web sites; one is for my private work at http://vickigold.com and the other is for my Marshfield High School work at http://goldclasses.com. I would truly appreciate an opportunity to talk with you about my work, and the direction you think I could go. Thank you for listening. Vicki Gold"

17060,Suggestions for intro to CS with scratch for 1st and 3rd graders,4/1/13 17:37,"Michelle, I ended up just doing an ad-hoc lesson for both classes.  I started out explaining how scripts work and introducing them to some basic commands to change position, color, etc... and then had them spend time experimenting.  They came up with quite a few great ideas. I was amazed at how quickly the 1st graders caught on.  The 3rd graders progressed even faster, and we eventually gave them a challenge task of making a sprite move through obstacles (using commands for arrow buttons, and then autonomously).  An alternate challenge was to create a conversation between 2 or more sprites. The 3rd grade teacher is planning to use Scratch to teach cartesian coordinate system, and maybe some other math concepts. It was a very rewarding day for me and great for the kids.  I think about half of them downloaded the program at home.  I'm glad I found out about Scratch - what a great way to introduce programming to kids.

I have created a new Class - I want to add an existing Scratch user to the class. When I go to Students and the Add User - I enter the correct (doubled checked) user name for the Scratch User. I get prompted that the user name already exists (which it does) but it will not let me add the user to the class. I have followed the user in question (my son) but how can i add existing users that i know to a class so that they can follow the plans for the class and submit their projects? Help please. I don't want to have to create brand new scratch accounts for students each time i create a new class, but will likely be adding teh same group of users time after time and class after class.

13314,"Teaching concepts and philosophies, lesson plans, Tinkering, and Scratch",7/6/12 12:06,"Hi all. I joined Scratch Ed long ago and quickly left and never came back. Instead, I began teaching Scratch users nightly in the All About Scratch forum (which has since changed titles) by helping them with their projects. My biggest concern was that here at Scratc Ed, there seemed to be a lot of education terminology and normal school philosophy thrown about but it seemed like very few people actually understood Scratch programing. I hope this has changed! Please understand, I am not trivializing the hard work and good intentions of so many people. I just think that if you are going to teach it, you need to understand it and that takes more effort than organizing a lesson plan and maintaining order in a classroom. I have almost a lifetime of association with education in many forms and the inflexibility often forced in a classroom environment is a terrible thing and a crutch for those who don't have an acceptable level of competency. The reason I am making this post is because I was contacted and asked to provide a lesson plan for a week long PicoBlocks class as I have taught a similar class before. PicoBlocks is a version of Scratch designed to interface Scratch programing with motorized Legos like the WeDo system. It utilizes a sensor board and is a lot of fun, which is critical to my way of teaching. Below is my emailed response, provided for you as a glimpse into a successful realization of implementing Scratch/PicoCrickets into a classroom along with some contemporary approaches to learning. I hope it inspires more of the same :) ___________________________________________________________________________________ (My old Scratch Ed post..) I  teach classes at a local museum using PicoBlocks along with the WeDo. PicoBlocks is a version of Scratch written specifically to interface the WeDo system along with the PicoCricket system. I have done both single day/ 3 hour classes and week long/ 4hour per day classes. So I have not established any set curriculum, especially that would apply to a long term class session however I would be happy to provide any help if desired. zac_ray@fastmail.fm I also have a Scratch projects gallery, some of which I have used in my classroom here. (http://scratch.mit.edu/users/Locomule) (the emailed request I recently received..) I was wondering if you have since written a plan/outline of something you use in a week long camp??? (and my reply, the point of this rambling, sorry..) I haven't created a lesson plan but would be glad to help if possible. Not knowing a potential instructors competency level with PicoBlocks-type programing is the biggest obstacle that I foresee. Otherwise, I would need to know classroom details.. exact # of class days and how many hours per day approximate # of students and ages # of instructors # of computers running PicoBlocks in the classroom what WeDo or Lego sets are going to be used Otherwise, I could provide some general concepts to be taken into consideration based on my experiences.. You cannot teach kids to program in a week so don't plan on it, especially when combining programing with Legos. But that is OK :) and all the more reason an instructor needs to be fluent in Pico programing. Classroom time will be limited so you must be able to teach and write and debug simple programs with confidence. Most kids will not want to learn the programing either, not once they see each other building Lego projects. I had the benefit of being allowed to teach my way, and I am not a big fan of typical lesson plans. I use them as guides, not hard and fast maps but then again, I am also an entertainer so I am fast on my feet. I prefer to be dynamic and respond to the changing needs of my classroom on the fly. I print out more activities, plans, etc than I need and divide them into 1) Gotta do cool stuff and 2) Kinda cool stuff. Likewise, I separate these into groups based on how much time they take up. This allows me to make sure that the best information gets experienced while throwing in quick lessons in moments of extra time. If I run out of time, I know that I am leaving out my least favored stuff. I'll touch on something at the end of this message called Tinkering and how it fits into my teaching style and PicoBlocks. I first spent showed off some Scratch games and stuff of my own, with a brief demonstration of how Pico blocks get put together in a program. (Scratch is the program that PicoBlocks is derived from and is almost the same thing) Our PicoCrickets came with cards that had various project ideas. My students picked some out and made musical Play-doh, a door alarm for our classroom, light sensors that set off multi-colored lights and various sounds such as cats meowing, horns, etc through a speaker. We did many other projects as well. We spent most of one day building projects that came with each WeDo kit. Some built moving sculptures, others built motorized windmills, etc. Between classes, I used a couple of kits to make a motorized car with headlights that you could steer. I told them that we would do something similar on the last day. But by then I realized that we could not, as a class, build individual Pico-driven cars and had too many students to build a single car. Instead, we made a drag race track for them to race simple, custom-made, non-Pico Lego cars on, complete with a Pico driven drag strip with a start/finish timing system with a red/yellow/green start light tree that lit up with slightly randomized light intervals. The students loved making the cars and then re-working them to improve their designs between races to make them faster. We made a big scoreboard on cardboard. It has been a while since I did this so I have forgotten many things, I'm sure. Since I did taught PicoCrickets, I have become very good at Scratch programing. I have also been sent to the Exploratorium Museum in San Francisco and learned about Tinkering. Tinkering is the evolution of education as facilitated in a museum environment. Sounds like a mouthful but it is really cool. The concept is based on the idea that we all learn in different ways so why force someone to use method A and ignore method B? For example, one Tinkering project I participated in involved our group walking into a space that had 3 tables filled with odds and ends... spools, wires, batteries, small 1.5v dc motors, glue guns, masking tape, tongue depressors, plastic cups, etc. Simple craft supplies. We were given minimal instruction, other than being shown how to hook batteries up to motors and how to use glue sticks to make an offset weight to attach to the motor. Our goal was to make simple bots that moved around. Afterwards, we discussed our individual methodologies. Some people looked at the supplies and thought, ""Hmmm, what could I make out of that?"" Others came up with a mental image of their bot and then sought materials to make it with. That is exactly the point, we all still learned but in ways that made sense to the individual learner. Tinkering is a way to provide open-ended solutions to a problem so that your audience can solve it their own way. In essence, they teach themselves. Your job as a facilitator is to answer questions, give simple examples, and occasionally inspire more thinking by saying ""What if you...?"" The reason I mention Tinkering is because my teaching style runs very parallel to Tinkering philosophy. That is why to others, my ""lesson plans"" probably look rather vague. There is no ""9:00 am do this 10:30 do that"" etc. Unless you repeat the same courses for many years, you won't know exactly how long things will take or how popular they will be with your students. My #1 rule in my classroom is that we have fun, and do we ever. Once the kids are having fun, they become inquisitive and begin teaching themselves and each other. You move from instructor to facilitator, but you have to be keenly aware of what is going on and quick to recognize when to jump in, jump out, or just observe. For example, one of the first questions once we started Lego drag racing was ""Why does my car keep losing?"" I (deliberately) said ""Friction"" and turned around as if to walk off. ""What is that?"" was the cry from me behind me so I turned back and said ""Ok, take one shoe off and leave the other on. Now slide the socked foot, then try to slide the other foot with the shoe still on it. The reason the shoed foot won't slide is easy IS friction!"" Then we got into how axles must rub against other parts of the car creating friction, how different wheels had varying properties of friction and smoothness of circular motion. Friction was good for winning on our race course, but what about stopping a real car? Now you need friction, big-time! In essence, we were Tinkering. It was a great experience. I'm sorry this message is so long but I didn't know how else to explain a Zac Ray lesson plan, heh. I judge my success on a few simple factors. I taught at a museum during the summer. Parents who often were just looking for baby-sitting with an edge called back wanting to sign their kids up for ""whatever classes Mr. Zac is teaching."" When it was time for lunch or to go home, students had to be forced out of their chairs. Take me out of the equation because I am the least important factor and imagine a classroom where kids have fun learning and don't want to stop. It is a beautiful thing! Seeing this happen in a public school setting is a dream of mine. Time after time, I saw public school teachers come in to teach other classes with that antiquated ""I'm gonna turn the lights on and off until you all settle down"" mentality and the kids suffered for it. Learning became a drag, and who wants to be involved in that? No one, even if you force them to do it anyway.

10109,Teaching elementary students about variables...,7/6/11 17:09,"I have been teaching 7th grade students (so they are nor really elementary..) to use variables trough scratch. What I did , was to let them discover how to create a new one and how to call it when they wanted to use it, I remember using counters basically. The truth it is that they didn´t find it difficult at all, it was a  natural step that they took, when they were ""advanced"" users, like after a semester. Hope this helps, Teresa"

10109,Teaching elementary students about variables...,10/12/11 19:10,"You should explain what a variable is in both uses, math and science. A variable is aan unknown and can be anything. In computer science, variables are used to hold temporary/changing data. Using the variable ""i"" as a counter in a loop is a basic use; but demonstrates the temporary and changing data structure of a variable. But variables can hold other data types also; words/text, booleans(true/false, on/off, 0/1,..) and can be very usefuls in programming. One Scratch project I developed for teaching is a clock. (This can be viewed and downloaded on the scratch site at http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/TinkerZone/2025446) This clock uses 8 variable throughout the scripts. The clocks movement and time keeping is math and scripting. If you download the program and study it, you will see how I used the variables throughout to accomplish this.The clock actually keeps time reasonably well. (especially since there is no connection between it and the system clock) Other uses for variable involve user interaction. Certain user input should be held by a variable. a calculator is a good example of using variables. When you input the first number it is assigned to a variable. Then you choose an operation and input a second number which is held by another variable.  Then the calculation is done and the answer is stored in another variable.  If the calculator stored these input values permanently, the application would eventually become unusable due to size.  By storing temporary information in a variable, the program remains intact and the temp information is deleted when it is not needed. If you open a Word doc and start typing, everything you type will be placed into a variable(s) until it is no longer needed or saved. The blank document that is created when you open the program is being held in variable until it is saved or deleted. OK. I got long winded. Sorry. :) I hope I have helped to shed some light upon variable and the uses and reasons."
10109,Teaching elementary students about variables...,2/24/12 14:06,"Based on the fact that students are usually ""afraid"" of variables -either because of their dull names (x) or their arithmetic values, I think an easy way to teach them is using the following very simple Scratch scenarion: Scratch dialogue where ""answer"" is indeed a variable with a very nice, human-friendly name and an obvious value! My students even got to love the math variables ;)"
10109,Teaching elementary students about variables...,2/26/12 20:16,I have taught 3rd graders using Scratch before and I have found that starting with a score variable is the easiest way to get them engaged since most of them know what a score is and know what they want it to do ahead of time. There is no hurdle of trying to explain why we want the variable and why it is useful. This also makes it easy to reenforce resetting the variable at the beginning since most students want their score to reset to zero at the beginning.

14130,Teaching Scratch to uninterested teens,1/26/13 16:22,"I have some similar challenges. I teach 9th grade. I used the resources at shallwelearn.com and modified them into small projects. The students could follow them exactly as written, but got extra points for personalization. At the beginning, for most kids, that means playing with beats, music, and drawing tools, which most teens like. The more motivated kids personalized the programs in more sophisticated ways. I didn't do much explicit teaching at first, but began incorporating 5 min. Do Nows to review the use of certain blocks and logic structures, which allowed me to teach certain things they were having trouble with. After a couple of projects, I assigned them an open-ended design project. They work in pairs or individually, by their own choice. The kids have really taken their own interests and incorporated them into the projects, and most are at least moderately engaged. I have posted my Do Nows in the resource section, and could share other stuff if desired. I hope that helps! One continuing challenge is that the kids work at wildly different speeds, so figuring out when to set firm deadlines for finishing projects is tough."

I didn't know about shallwelearn.com, thank you for that. I have experimented in different ways with my students to interest them in learning Scratch. The best results I got was with a maze game assignment which made them want to get the sprite through the maze. I too find it necessary to limit the amount of  time spent on the exercises. I love your idea of an open-ended design project. The key I think is in allowing them to develop their own ideas. It is better to not be too controlling. Thanks again Kelly for you help."
14130,Teaching Scratch to uninterested teens,1/28/13 22:02,My students love the Dance Party activity that was just mentioned by Michelle Chung. It really gets the kids up and moving and ties programming to something the students can relate to. One thing that motivated my students was to have them create games for a special education classroom. The difference in the quality of work went way up when they realized that they were not creating something just to get a passing grade. They loved the idea that they were creating something that would be used by other students.
8760,Teaching uses of Scratch Socket Server,12/22/10 20:50,"I've been playing with the socket server present in Scratch that allows Scratch to read data from the Picoboard.  This feature also allows Scratch to communicate with other programs (via global variables, broadcasts, and sensor values).  Although interesting in itself, I'm not seeing how these communication capabilities would be useful in the classroom. So, I'm asking the ScratchEd group.  Here's a few ideas of projects that I think could be possible using the communication capability.  Do you think they have educational uses?  (Note that these projects would require an external program running in the background to coordinate the communications.) Scratch Chat - 2 computers (within same local area network) could have a text chat via Scratch.  Maybe the chat could appear as 2 sprites talking to each other. Weather Station - the external program could pull weather data from a website and feed it to Scratch.  Students programs could collect / graph / analyze some weather parameter. WebSnatch - OK, dumb name.  The idea here is that the external program could periodically access a website and look for a keyword, then return something back to Scratch that the students could use for something (pretty vague definition!). File Access - the communication capability could be used as a simple file read / write system to allow Scratch programs to save / restore data (maybe from / to a list). Is there educational value to such projects?  Or maybe these ideas have got your creative juices flowing and you have a better idea.  Either way, I'd like to hear your feedback. Thanks, Kent"

What should I expect. Is there any general advice for a first year teacher wanting to introduce Scratch programming?
6980,Teaching with Scratch,10/8/10 21:40,"Hello Jessica, Say a little more about the context for your Scratch work with this student.  Is this part of a Scratch class and he/she is having trouble reading the scripts, or are you tutoring and looking for ways Scratch can turn him/her on to reading? If the latter, some of the story-telling projects might be fun to try.  For example, have the student take some photos around school, make a Scratch slide show that is just a sprite switching costumes (the imported photos), then record narration about what the photos say about the school as a special place. Link that to reading a picture book about special places such as A Quiet Place by Douglas Woods or When I was Young in the Mountains by C. Rylant. If you're thinking more about using Scratch as a way to practice specific skills, how about having the student make a flash card game that features the sight words he/she most needs to memorize?  The words appear on the screen (sprite costumes again), pause for reading, then have a voice recording that says the word for the student to check. Or, if none of this fits, keep asking! Karen R."

I looked at the topics in the required curriculum and asked myself where using Scratch would enhance student learned of specific concepts.  I chose three areas for the kids to make their own projects and a few others where a demonstration project made by me would help in the teaching. 1.  Coordinate geometry: project was to make their initials using only pen and ""go to x, y"" commands.  First they did this in quadrant one, then they had to draw three more sets of initials in the other quadrants, same distance from the x,y axis as the first ones.  It was very hard for some of the kids to do the transfer, and told me a lot about their visual/spatial understanding. http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/room209/321638 2.  Similarity:  project was to make a very simple quadrilateral-based character, then use a formula to enlarge or shrink it.  They made variables with sliders to show that if you only mess with one coordinate, the image is not similar to the orginal. http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/ExpoSchool/867742 3.  Geometry terms:  The geometry at this level included lots of vocabulary, so I had the kids make a Scratch dictionary defining some of the terms and illustrating them with an animation. http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/room209/913317 Project demonstrations: Equations with variables represent real situations http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/room209/672035 http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/DrSuper/676759 Probability http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/room209/581 Graphing equations http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/DrSuper/323304 Exponents http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/DrSuper/300519"

27552,The Big Book of Scratch,5/30/14 16:50,"The Big Book of Scratch (BBS) Objective: To encourage children to read, write and publish interactive Scratch books in a collaborative way. Methodology: 1.     To establish a platform by which the children can hangout with one another. This may be something like a Google+ hangout or some other reliable, safe and free type of platform. 2.     To establish a group of teacher-mentors in their own specialties who will be willing to guide the children in the different aspects of making a book from scratch. : ) (no pun intended) Note: In view of the long hours that teachers work, there will probably be three or four teacher per group of students so that at any one time, a teacher-mentor can make it to the hangout. 3.     To develop a MOOC on how to publish a book. This is not to be intensive but encouraging, explaining the process of making a book from A to Z. This will mean that industry specialists who may not be Scratchers will have to be called in to talk to the students during the MOOC. To encourage the children, perhaps those who participate may be given some certificate at the end of the MOOC which will show that they have learned how to make a book (in theory) or some other form of motivational reward. 4. To create a website for this project under the same principle of a group of teacher-mentors to a group of interested students. 5. To develop a sign-up page for students to sign up for the various groups, for example, writers, illustrators, proofreaders, editors, publishers, marketing, communication, Scratch debuggers, translators, website managers and so on. 6. When the project is completed, to create an awareness website for the advertisement of this book and the books to come. This will be also run by students  with teacher-mentors. This website will provide links to Scratch, ScratchJr, ScratchEd and other interesting educational website suggested by our Scratchers. 7. When enough books have been published, a number to be agreed on by the BBS Encouragement Committee, to run an annual contest funded by Kickstarter to award the top 3 books published per year.

The Catroid project (Alpha) code.google.com/p/catroid/ is off to a good start, working on a number of Android handsets.  My own tests using a Nook Color didn't go too well, but directionally it's getting there.  Currently this is not port-able to the main Scratch site, but posting is on its own Catroid site (also Alpha). Within the last 24 hours, the talented community of programmers at XDA Developers have managed the incredible feat of developing a Ubuntu port to the Nook Color, sans tether (see   Initial attempts to get a Scratch Ubuntu DEB package to install failed.  Also, trying to play an existing Scratch .sb file using a browser plus the ScratchApplet.jar and soundbank.gm files did not work.  Undoubtedly as the development of Nookbuntu progresses and more functionality is built, we might finally have a ""portable"" Scratch that will be compatible with the main Scratch site.

10295,Thoughts for future Scratch workshops/meetups,7/31/11 18:20,"I had a wonderful time at the Creative Computing Workshop and I wanted to thank everyone for making our time together a meaningful experience.  I learned a lot about teaching Scratch and I look forward to sharing my new found insights with my students. I would love for us to continue to share and possibly meet in the future.  I would like to discuss the possibility of having a meetup in Connecticut in the fall. We could get together on either a Saturday or a Sunday at a local public library (they have free internet and available meeting rooms).  I thought that the topic of our meetup could be the planning of a group activity, centered around Scratch for Computer Science Education Week. Here is some information about last year's CSEd Week - http://www.csedweek.org/. Thanks again for an amazing learning opportunity! Patrice Gans pgans@fraserwoods.com"

34282,Thoughts on Google's CS First?,5/12/15 19:26,"Has anyone had experience with Google's CS First at http://www.cs-first.com? I ask because while I've skimmed the videos and resources, I haven't really had the chance to use it with my kids. We're exclusively using the ScratchED curriculum guide + workbook. My point of view is that CS First seems like a great idea if you want to get non-technical parents to help mentor in the club but may be too restrictive/scripted for very small groups that only need one mentor and that mentor is technical enough. What do others think?"
34282,Thoughts on Google's CS First?,6/24/15 18:03,I felt like it's great for teachers that don't have any CS background - it's pretty much all directed and taught through video.  I think for teachers that want to have a bit more input into the types of projects that the students will work on it might be too restrictive.

836,Tons of Questions....,9/16/09 2:50,"I have a Games Design course for HS students, and I have a vision of having all 12 kids sitting at computers in our school network, writing games in Scratch. Then, at the end of the period, they upload their games to a gallery I have created called 'HKISgamers', where we can all access them and play each other's creations that night from our homes. But here's the rub. 1) I have created the gallery, made it public access, but how do I get my kids to be able to find it to contribute their work? There is no 'search galleries' function. 2) If three or four kids all try to log on to their Scratch accounts from different computers in our network, they end up being logged into someone else's account instead. Apparently, I cant have multiple users from a single network on line simultaneously. 3) When someone tries to upload their game, the screen goes dark and they are told that they are trying to do an impossible task and told to restart. I have a sneaking feeling that this is related to #2. How do I achieve my vision of having a  common, findable gallery where the kids can deposit their work while in school? M"
836,Tons of Questions....,9/16/09 19:19,"Hi Myron, I answered this in a different thread, but I'll repeat and extend here. :) 1) I have created the gallery, made it public access, but how do I get my kids to be able to find it to contribute their work? There is no 'search galleries' function. The Scratch search (located at the top of the page, to the right) can be used to search for galleries. For example, I'm a teaching assistant for a course this term. I set up a gallery that I named MAS.714 2009. The participants can search for MAS.714 2009 and filter or refine the results to include only galleries. (The options are for refining by users, forums, projects, galleries, or documentation.) 2) If three or four kids all try to log on to their Scratch accounts from different computers in our network, they end up being logged into someone else's account instead. Apparently, I cant have multiple users from a single network on line simultaneously. That's really bizarre! You definitely should be able to have multiple users from a single network on Scratch simultaneously. We do it fairly regularly in our research group -- and I've done it in schools. Maybe you could try some controlled tests (one person on, add another person, etc.) to see where things are getting funky? 3) When someone tries to upload their game, the screen goes dark and they are told that they are trying to do an impossible task and told to restart. I have a sneaking feeling that this is related to #2. Wow -- that's also really strange! Could you give me a bit more information about what version of Scratch you're running and in what type of configuration (type of machines, OS, etc.)? How do I achieve my vision of having a  common, findable gallery where the kids can deposit their work while in school? Hopefully, that was answered by 1.

27189,Transition from Scratch to C++,5/12/14 20:22,"Hello, I am new to Scratch and, after a couple of projects to try it out, I'm quite impressed. I would very much like to use it for my community college electronics technology students who are learning programming down at the hardware level with Arduino or bare microcontrollers (e.g. AVR, PIC). Unfortunately, most are not programmers, having chosen electronics over programming because they prefer working with hardware. In other courses, they learn Karel for Fanuc industrial robots and ladder logic. They are not computer science majors, nor do they aspire to be. They do like to make things work, though. I would like to introduce programming concepts with Scratch. That looks easy enough thanks to all the resources out there. I will also introduce them to Scratch for Arduino (s4a.cat) But it's the next step that puzzles me: how to transition to ""production"" O-O programming languages like Python and C++? The way I see it, the conventional O-O paradigm works fine for each object if you treat sprites as objects (cloning sprites is similar to instantiating objects of a class). However, it's not so obvious for messages, events and concurrent execution of sprites (objects). For example, interrupts are events, so Scratch is helpful to introduce the concept of an interrupt service routine (handler) that runs asynchronously. However, broadcasting messages between objects (tasks?) typically requires some OS support. Any ideas? Are there any resources to map Scratch concepts to conventional O-O programming? Thanks"

They work on something and have no way to get back to it the next day. I'm thinking they should upload projects to their Scratch pages and then download them to work on them the next class. Is that what schools do? How can I troubleshoot the uploading problem? Any suggestions are most appreciated!
8916,Troubleshooting Uploading problems,1/23/11 10:56,Hi Susan I have the same problem. Your network passes probably thru a proxyserver some where. But you should be able to save your projectfiles on the fileserver.... if you have one. Ask your IT-department they should be able to help you... (or not? ;)) Or maybe use http://www.dropbox.com/ (if you can install things on the computer) You can find the proxyfix here: http://info.scratch.mit.edu/Network_Installation About proxy servers Proxy server settings can be specified in the Scratch.ini file using the following entries: ProxyServer=[server name or IP address] ProxyPort=[port number]

Arbitrarily, let's say you assign 0 to the darkest colors and 500 to the lightest. Then you could create a maze project where your sprite is programmed to behave a certain way when hitting the walls (when color =0, turn right). Then hold up a maze to the webcam and see if your sprite can make it through. Another option might be to create image filtering art projects, similar in function to Instagram or Photobooth. Use commonds like ""if color > 400, change color to random"". Just a thought. :)"
12687,Try Scratch 2.0 from May 17-21,5/22/12 8:51,"Hi, David. Thanks for the suggestion. We've been experimenting with sensing color from the video using the existing color touching blocks. The idea is that, when the video is turned on, those blocks could sense colors from either things on the stage or from the video. If it works well enough, that would allow users to draw mazes and hold them up to a webcam as you suggest, as well as projects such as those shown in this (old) video created by Jay Silver and Eric Rosenbaum, two graduate students in the group: ?????????? http://vimeo.com/9512436. It's an interesting idea to sense only brightness. One of the big issues with color involves calibration to different cameras and lighting conditions. A brightness sensor might also require some calibration, but since it's just a single threshold, it's much easier to work with, similar to using the ""loudness"" block. I can imagine that many projects would not need any calibration at all and, if they did, a single slider would be sufficient. -- John"

I'm sure everything will be perfectly redesigned before the official release. Even cloud variables (even if I don't expect to use them a lot) will allow students to have a lot of fun. What is that I like really a lot? Custom blocks and clones. And I expect to love a lot the new vector-graphics image editor too (not accessible yet). What I don't like at present? Some ""hidden"" behaviours: it is not immediate to understand if and how custom blocks can have arguments; it is not immediate to manage clones; it is not immediate (in version 2.0, it used to by immediate in Scratch 1.x) to access sprite's info (name, position, etc). Anyway I expect Scratch 2.0 to be a great tool for all of us, with all we need already set up for the best user experience."

8394,Turn off a broadcast,11/18/10 11:14,What does the rest of your code look like? You will need to structure your code so that the broadcast block only gets executed once; you can also try using the stop script block.

8529,Tutorial for students in grades 6-8,11/22/10 22:27,"I plan to introduce Scratch programming software to students in grades 6-8 by February of 2011. None of these students have been formally introduced to programming. I saw Scratch in action at a MICCA conference in April of 2010 and was impressed. I believe students will learn some valuable programming concepts by using Scratch. Since I am not a programmer, I will need an easy-to-use Scratch tutorial to familiarize myself with Scratch before introducing the program to students. Can anyone recommend an easy-to-use Scratch tutorial with learning activities appropriate for middle school students? Once I'm comfortable enough with the program, I plan to have students use Scratch to develop curriculum based projects. From GE"

8529,Tutorial for students in grades 6-8,11/24/10 14:46,"Hi George, I also recommend the support page on the Scratch website. There are also resources and tutorial pages. As for student activities, my favorite is the exquisite corpse activity. There is a worksheet and  teacher's reflection. I'd also recommend looking at the Scratch Cards. There is a discussion about this here which might give you some more ideas about introducing Scratch to beginners. I would also check through the resources in the 13-15 age range. I'd be interested to hear about you and your students' progress. Keep us updated!"
8529,Tutorial for students in grades 6-8,11/25/10 4:52,"I agree with MIke about Pong - it covers a lot of skills and concepts and getting a working game is a satisfying result. With our year 5/6 group we guided step by step through this activity in about 15-20 mins max, then in the remaining workshop time invited modifications and improvements, which were plentiful. The example projects also provide a range of potential project starting points."

I love using Scratch with our CC at Bishopthorpe Primary but, sometimes, am not sure what direction to take next with the pupils and Scratch - so I need some collaboration with others to get good ideas. Could we use something like Doodle http://doodle.com/en_GB/ (possible attendees put their preferred dates & times into a calendar) to decide on a slot? I say this, because I find so often that I'm committed to something else on the date and time chosen, and I've also found using Doodle a great way to get people to definitely commit. About an aim.  Some hands-on use of Scratch, perhaps beyond what most of us are doing at present, would be great as I know the N STEM Ctre has suitable facilities. I loving coming there so I try to book myself a resource day as often as I can and attended a really good Raspberry Jam in the Autumn.

All our Internet traffic passes through proxy servers. I have discovered the scratch.ini file can be used to define the proxy server and port on MS windows computers. Does any one know the syntax for defining the proxy username and password? We are also tring to identify the equivalent configuration file for Scratch in both the Sugar and Gnome versions for use with the OLPC XO laptops. Hoping someone has already solved this challenge. Cheers Ian"
5218,Uploading Scratch through a Proxy Server,7/19/10 20:25,"Hi, Ian. This page has some information about the proxy settings: http://info.scratch.mit.edu/Network_Installation I believe the proxy mechanism should work on all platforms, not just Windows. For the XO, the configuration file is Scratch.ini in the Scratch folder. I think that works in Gnome as well as Sugar, but I haven't tested it. Note: If you use the Linux version of Scratch instead of the XO version, then the configuration file is .scratch.ini in the user's home folder. But I recommend using the XO version of Scratch on the XO, even under Gnome. -- John"
5218,Uploading Scratch through a Proxy Server,7/20/10 1:13,"Hi John, I have not been able to find any ini/conf files for Scratch in the Sugar environment. A search of the /home/olpc/Activities/Scratch.activity/ and sub directories did not yield any results. I installed scratch-1.4.0.1-1.i386 as super user and the Scratch.ini file resides in /usr/lib/scratch/directory. The ProxyServer= and ProxyPort= lines in the scratch.ini file (http://info.scratch.mit.edu/Network_Installation) work when the proxy server does not require a username and password. However, the scratch upload fails when a proxy server authentication is required. My instinct tells me that there are a couple of additional lines required in the scratch.ini file   which define the username and password for proxy authentication. Cheers Ian"
5218,Uploading Scratch through a Proxy Server,7/20/10 8:02,"Hi, Ian. Unfortunately, Scratch does not support proxies that require authentication. Perhaps you can convince your IT folks to run a proxy server that does not require authentication... On the XO, even if there is not already a Scratch.ini file in the Scratch.activity folder, you can create one with a text editor add the proxy lines. Make sure that the file is readable by world so the Scratch activity can read it. On Fedora, I'm pretty sure Scratch ignores the Scratch.ini file in /usr/lib/scratch (which probably shouldn't have been included) and uses the file .scratch.ini in the user's home folder instead. You can test this by switching languages, then verifying that ~/.scratch.ini was created. (Scratch records the language setting in that file.) Hope that helps... -- John"

I'm trying to create a ""skateboarding / snowboarding"" animation, and I want to hide or show one sprite and one background, for either type of recreation.  But in Scratch, the button sprite won't show a ""change background"" and I'm having trouble with designating the ""hide"" or ""show"" commands to a specific sprite.  In MicroWorlds, for example, I could write a program for a button such as: to go_to_snowboarding page2 show ""skateboarding button"" hide ""snowboarding button"" end Then I would create a parallel but reversed procedure and button, to toggle back and forth between the two pages. I'm sure this is easy to do, but I've been unable to figure it out on my own. Thanks for any advice you all might offer. John Kendall Rutgers Prep, NJ"

2119,Using Lego WeDo parts,1/1/10 9:09,"Hello, Spent yesterday playing around with some Lego Wedo parts in Scratch. Right now Scratch can recognize / control one motor.  One can hook two motors together and they will both do the same thing, but they cannot be controlled separately. I'd like to see the ability added to sense what is hooked up via usb and then have the ability to control it / them. This would extend to the sensors as well I suppose. On a non-Scratch note the Wedo tilt sensors are simply awful. At first I thought I had a dud, but the one from the second packet was just as bad. It is supposed to generate a number depending on which way the unit is tilted, but I think a random number generator would be just about as useful.   :-("

253,Using Scratch in ELL Learning,10/23/09 18:45,"As a reading specialist collaborating with Jeff, I am interested in accelerating our English language learners' academic achievement. The class is made up of Level 1 and Level 2 (WIDA Access) adolescents, many of whom arrive in the States with little if any previous formal education. There is a lot of incidental learning, i.e., they are acquiring skills without realizing it, especially in algebra and math applications. We are cognizant that, as each student explores new skills (adding color, adding sound, etc.), he/she becomes an ""expert"" and we encourage the social interaction that naturally occurs. Language teachers take note: all four skills (listening, speaking, reading, writing) are very organically involved in each class session; the communication is authentic and therefore very powerful. We're about 6 weeks into it, and even the most ""disengaged"" adolescents (we are noticing) are plugging into the program, so to speak. They want to be part of the ""fun""!"

253,Using Scratch in ELL Learning,10/26/09 16:29,"Assorted reflections from today's class: 1. We are using a lesson that Isaac and I made this past Summer (http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/jelkner/591204).  The goals of the lesson are to help develop a feel for how changes in x and y effect direction, and changes in the repeat value effect magnitude (distance).  For most students the lesson is working as planned. I encountered one student, however, who can not yet compare numbers, so the lesson was completely inappropriate for her.  I immediately when looking for a Scratch activity involving ""which number is bigger"", but I didn't find one.  Perhaps Galleries linked to math domains could be setup to help make these easier? 2.  I haven't used Galleries yet.  It wasn't until today that I started thinking about them, but I can imagine a lot of uses for them.  We could create a gallery for each class, or even each project.  Perhaps Galleries could be used to link project to specific curricula, by openning them up to the world and labelling them clearly.  I created one now to get started with our next class project: http://scratch.mit.edu/galleries/view/62163.  It will be interesting to see how it works."

253,Using Scratch in ELL Learning,10/31/09 23:59,"Yes, having the students demonstrate their understanding of a story is powerful. The two main characters are stuck in an elevator for 19 hours. The students are able to ""de-construct"" the scene as depicted via the words in the story, but we are finding that they are, in fact, having difficulty inferring what the conversation may be between 2 strangers stuck on an elevator together (who later fall in love and get married!) Most of them have the characters saying, ""Hi, how are you?"" and the responses are mostly formulaic, ""I'm fine. How are you?"" It's a step that needs more discussion.... On the other hand, our expectations for the project are constantly being ""upped"" in that we think they should be able to do certain things (change backgrounds, have the characters move, ""talk"" --and then someone learns how to record their voices and vroom! the rest of the group wants to learn how to record their dialogs!

There is no question that learning is occurring among our 25 student-community. In fact, the fact that we see ourselves as a true learning community somewhat adds to the difficulty of grading students. We have rubrics to guide them (and us), but our rubrics always seem to fall short. Our students always seem to be able to surprise us with capabilities that we don't foresee. For example, in our most recent project, the students imported 30"" of music--a skill not covered in our rubric. In summary, though, we continue to struggle with grading--content and skills. We observe how some students are able to work fast, help others, show creativity, use correct grammar and mechanics, and get the work done on time. We also observe less skilled students getting the help from those others and learning to the best of their (language and technical) ability. We attempt to pair students with different first languages in order to have them use language for authentic (and more rewarding on many levels) purposes. As a learning communicty, the class deserves an A. I'm not sure how the individuals will fare...."

Most of us eductaors know that the best online resource is one that allows more classroom control. Web 2.0 sites like EDUglogster and Edmodo get it and I know Scrtach will too eventually! The trick is to keep design a place in the site for teachers and students to collaborate as a private group, but also allow enough open-ness (public) to share with others in the public Scratch community.

23537,Ways for students to share their scratch projects,11/7/13 8:17,"I'm going to add my two cents to this issue because there have been several posts about class management of Scratch projects since 2.0 came out. First I want to say how awesome Scratch 2.0 is, and give a big pat on the back to the Scratch team for delivering such a great web app. I still consider Scratch to be my top application for teaching elementary and middle school computer science, as well as just the coolest program to create stuff with in general. That said, and as others have commented on here, it has been a frustrating experience using Scratch 2.0 in a classroom environment. Creating a class Studio for projects is simply not working. As a result, we cannot see all of our projects in one place, and comment and critique them. Working in the cloud only (with Chromebooks), I am forced to have kids copy and paste links to their projects into an Edmodo group, where we can see each other's work and make comments. Very cumbersome. And with grades where I cannot use Edmodo, I am lost. I know the Scratch team is working on a Class Management tool, and I have to emphasize that tool cannot come soon enough. Please know this is not a trivial matter for educators using Scratch 2.0. We desperately want to use Scratch, but this Studio issue is really messing things up :( respectfully, Peter R."
23537,Ways for students to share their scratch projects,11/10/13 15:46,"Can I ask here if it would be possible to link the sharing to a Google-ID. Advantages: 1. Widely known, trusted, used. In education paticularly. 2. Allows Google-groups to be used for authroization. This allows both professional (with Google-apps domain) and private (free version of google-groups) usage.  If the authorization is chosen the way Zoho com does (allows signing in with a google-apps-domain ID without the domain admin having to authorize it, that would be great) 3. MIT already hosts appinventor which uses google-logins. So it should be known within the organization. 4.  It will still allow the core (scratch) to be hosted at MIT or anywhere. 5. Google has a good security reputation. 6. It could be advantageous to not have to share with the whole world. A student could be allowed to share work with just a teacher. This would involve changing the code, though. Possible disadvantages: 1. Avoid getting tied in to G+ for privacy reasons and it will exclude many domains/schools that do allow Gapps but not G+. 2. General privacy concerns. 3. Will require signup for Google-ID. 4. Exclusion of countries that block Google. Just my 2c. Y. added thoughts: Currently the way to see the work of a group of students is really only possible of the students make links to their publicly shared projects available. Ways of doing this? 1. email to teacher. (gets confusing) 2. Collect all links in one google-site or in a forumpost in a google-group or VLE. 3. Put them all in a doc (table) or spreadsheet in a doc that is shared with the group. Currently it is not possible to collaborate on programming, but that may be aiming to high. Since students can share IDs they can learn from each other, but could also copy parts from each other. In individual marking situations this is not an advantage."
23537,Ways for students to share their scratch projects,11/11/13 18:04,"I agree with your observations.  I have been able to create studios and have my students share their programs, but this only works when they are all done with their programs.  And once they share their programs, EVERYONE can see it, which starts to be a bit too distracting for the students. I have been doing pair programming, which I really like, but since students can't share an account it causes a problem when one of the students is absent.  I agree a Class Management tool is ideal. I would love to continue any and all Scratch 2.0 conversations directly. You can find me on twitter @reesegans"
23537,Ways for students to share their scratch projects,11/18/13 15:56,I have been teasting using Edmodo. Kids can post the URLs in the site (after they shared) and we can all see what they have done.
23537,Ways for students to share their scratch projects,11/20/13 4:30,"I agree with Peter R. The children I teach really want to share their creations with the rest of the class but finding a suitable and secure way is tricky. I need something that is quick and easy and won't get bogged down with being blocked by educational ISPs. On a lighter note, my children have only recently started using Scratch (2 1/2 weeks in) and can't get enough of it. It is seriously blowing my mind! Robert N @nobleICT"

31119,Web tool to analyze your scratch projects and improve your programming skills,12/15/14 3:45,"Hi! We have created a free web tool to automatically analyze Scratch projects that we have called Dr. Scratch. This tool will allow your students to improve their programming skills by identifying areas that they could explore further and by detecting possible issues in their programs . On the one hand, by just uplading a Scratch project to Dr. Scratch, it will give you information about the development of Computational Thinking in terms of abstraction, logical thinking, synchronization, parallelization, flow control, user interactivity and data representation. In the same vein, by uploading a Scratch project to Dr. Scratch, you will receive feedback that could help you to improve your programs, as the tool detects several issues like code that is never executed (dead code), repeated code, objetcs with default names or sprites attiributes, like position or size, that may be modified but not correctly initialized. Dr. Scratch is free open source software, which is being developed by a team of teachers, developers and researchers at the Universidad Rey Juan Carlos, Spain. We have plenty of ideas for keep on improving Dr. Scratch (like creating teachers accounts so educators can easily analyze their students projects), and we look enthusiastically forward to Scratchers’ comments, suggestions, and feedback, either here in the ScratchED forum, by email (drscratch@programamos.es) or by Twitter (@drscratchtool). Dr. Scratch is available at http://drscratch.programamos.es I hope you guys enjoy it! Jesús Moreno (for the Dr. Scratch team)"

1062,Website vs. local,10/4/09 21:22,Some of my students claim their Scratch programs run differently (timings are off?) on the website than do when running locally...are there known problems  with this?
1062,Website vs. local,10/5/09 6:27,"That  is an existing issue with the java player used on the site. However, in my experience, a lot of the trouble that studnts have with timing has to do with how they trigger events. Trying to sync things up with the ""timer"" or with they ""wait___ sec"" blocks will typically suffer from some sort of lag.  On the hand, chaining a series of events together with the ""boadcast,"" or ""broadcast and wait,"" blocks will help a lot. This tutorial on creating dialog may help clarify what I am describing."

10246,Welcome to Creative Computing 2011!,7/27/11 18:30,"I am looking forward to connecting with other educators and learning new programming techniques which I can then share with my students.  I am also hoping to develop lessons/curriculum that I can share with other teachers at my school, which will demonstrate the power of Scratch."
10246,Welcome to Creative Computing 2011!,7/27/11 18:40,I would like to learn what other teacher are doing in scratch so that I may improve my portfolio.
10246,Welcome to Creative Computing 2011!,7/28/11 6:39,I'm also interested in the PicoBoard. Let's try to connect this week and explore possibilities. Larry

I am still new to scratch but I think I am going to use it to help me create a project on 'Goal Setting and Self-Esteem. I have developed a whole program that is related to this issue. I will try to keep up with the rest of the class:-)"
10246,Welcome to Creative Computing 2011!,7/28/11 6:55,I am also interested in programing Lego Mindstorms.  We might be able to get a group together on the independent work afternoon.  I look forward to working with you.
10246,Welcome to Creative Computing 2011!,7/28/11 7:13,"Kathie, I definitely want to share info with you. I taught comp sci as a business department teacher (and I used Scratch and Python) and am now the hs instructional tech specialist as well as business dept chair. I am also working on PD in Scratch for HS teachers."
10246,Welcome to Creative Computing 2011!,7/28/11 7:18,"Maria, Have you seen the Harvard CS50: Introduction to Programming and Scratch on the ScratchEd Resources Page? It's a great example of introducing programming."
10246,Welcome to Creative Computing 2011!,7/28/11 8:32,I don't know that kids need to be taught how to think creatively. Scratch allows them to express their creative thinking in ways that were not possible before though. Along the way they will learn about logic and problem decomposition.
10246,Welcome to Creative Computing 2011!,7/28/11 8:37,"Joanne, It's nice to see another elementary teacher.  So often, things like this are thought to be for middle school and up.  We've used Scratch a little with our elementary students in Suffern, NY and they pick it up so fast.  I look forward to getting some great ideas for our little guys."
10246,Welcome to Creative Computing 2011!,7/28/11 8:39,Eric I think it's great that you want to share Scratch with your students. Elementary students will love it!
10246,Welcome to Creative Computing 2011!,7/28/11 8:42,"Scratch can be another vehicle for demonstrating what you have learned, like presentations or a word processing document (see http://cast.org/udl/index.htmll). The problem is where should the student learn it? Where do they learn word processing or presentations? Do you have the time to teach Scratch in an ELA course? Or do you collaborate with other teachers to have cross-curricular projects?"

10246,Welcome to Creative Computing 2011!,7/28/11 8:52,"Patrice, This is what I would like to do too and also get the 7th and 8th grade students and teachers at my school to use Scratch rather than just PowerPoint for their projects in the core curriculum areas."
10246,Welcome to Creative Computing 2011!,7/28/11 8:53,I agree with you. I am always looking for new ideas to increase the types of projects to have my students create.
10246,Welcome to Creative Computing 2011!,7/28/11 8:56,"When I used this with my grade 5 inclusion class, it was an opportunity for my kids on IEP's with reading and language disabilities to shine.

10246,Welcome to Creative Computing 2011!,7/28/11 9:03,"Hi Gilberto, I want to do the same as you. Last year I asked teachers what they were doing in class so that I could incorporate their lessons into my technology classes. I wanted to specifically use Scratch for the 3rd grade and I couldn't figure out what to do? So I hope to get ideas as well as resources to find them. Good Luck"
10246,Welcome to Creative Computing 2011!,7/28/11 9:03,"Have you read Gardner's latest, ""Five Minds for the Future?"" His ""Creative"" and ""Synthesizing"" minds are definitely exercised with Scratch."
10246,Welcome to Creative Computing 2011!,7/28/11 9:04,The actual teaching of the program only has to really happen once. I have done it as part of a final project for a unit. I do the same for Powerpoint and all the other programs we use. Just embed the teaching of the program into the schedule of the unit plan.
10246,Welcome to Creative Computing 2011!,7/28/11 9:05,"Exactly, hearing what others are creating, will most likely trigger some of my own ideas."

3573,What a Seasoned Professional has to Learn from Scratch,4/21/10 15:18,"Todays modern programming platforms generally hand you the world on a silver platter. Typically all you have to do is peice all the right components together logically to create a solution to a problem. When creating complex solutions in Scratch, I have had to create my own data structures. Examples: Using a one dimensional list like a two dimensional list to create a matrix Using a list as a stack to store and idententies and locations of sprites which are shooting in a game Using variables to store a unique identifiers so that a sprit can be identifed and dynamic messages can be created to manipulate a groups of sprites Using list to store a ID's of active and inacvtive sprites Working in Scratch also demonstrates the difficulties in working with and syncronizing multiple threads of execution and the issues involved with variable access from multiple threads of execution. The limited (while at the same time powerful) nature of Scratch forces one to examine the solution to a problem in fine detail and to create many things from scratch (no pun intended). For the first time in years I have found myself programming for pleasure. It is the challenge of finding solutions to complex problems and being able to examine the solutions that others have created in solving similar problems, that make working in Scratch so enjoyable. I am looking forward to a workshop that I am giving to GT students on April 24th, 2010 and hope that at least one of my students gets the programming bug after their experience in my workshop. I have pushed Scratch and my own skills to the limit to prepare myself to be able to answer all of their questions accurately and intellegently."

If a student were to tell me that he or she  would like to learn to write code, what should I suggest to him or her?

I personally am biased towards a number of computer languages and I think if you asked a truely random sample of people the same question you would get a number of different answers. Here are some of my picks. Squeak - www.squeak.org/ - Smalltalk is one of the earliest of the OO family and it's what Scratch was created with Ruby - www.ruby-lang.org/en/ - Newer OO languages. Not created in a lab. Python - www.python.org And then the politically incorrect choice that I prefer. VB.NET - www.microsoft.com/express/Default.aspx - VB Express is free. Easy and Powerful but quite proprietary and Windows only Some people may notice a lack of languages with { } (C, C++, Java, C#) because some of them are truly flawed (C, C++)  and the others I just don't like.

3573,What a Seasoned Professional has to Learn from Scratch,4/23/10 3:02,Thank you very much for your suggestions.  I have printed them out and will certainly look into them. Your help is truly appreciated. : )
3573,What a Seasoned Professional has to Learn from Scratch,4/26/10 12:54,"On Saturday April 24, 2010 I gave a short (3 hr) Scratch workshop to GT students in Grand Junction, CO. Unfortunately, due to the short notice give out about the class, I only had two students plus my own daughter. After delivering my first Scratch workshop I noted serveral items about the students experience in the class. Scratch seemed natural to them. They immediately had a graps on dragging the language elements into a script. Occasionally we had an bug which we all had fun trying to track down due to placement of a language element in the wrong location. Sometimes with quite humorous results. I had to double my time alotted to looking at the Scratch website because the students wanted to see as much as possible of what was out there. We did not have time to see all 1,000,000 projects :-) Both or my students indicated that they would continue using with Scratch at home. We used scratch to build an aquarium simulator in a somewhat guided fashion and then the students were let go to either create their own project or remix another project from the Scratch website. The topics covered were. The Scratch interface Creating and loading sprites Changing the background When clicked forever loops if and if else touching touching random 1 to 2 move steps turn degrees say for 2 seconds play sound until done change y by publishing to the Scratch website It was not possible in the time alotted to work with variables and messages although messaging was demonstrated and variables discussed at a high level. The students were given a three ring binder with the Scratch manual and the Scratch cards in hope of giving them enough tools to continue their exploration. I am currently looking within my school district for opportunities to either teach Scratch to other students over an extended period of time or to educators in a workshop setting."
3573,What a Seasoned Professional has to Learn from Scratch,4/26/10 16:47,"On the subject of other learning environments, I've recently heard about Scala ( http://www.scala-lang.org/ ), but I don't know much about it. Regarding the need to use Scratch in ingenious ways to simulate features that are available in some other computer programming systems, yes, that is a fact.  However, to include most of these features on a par with other Scratch features would, I think, be giving beginners to much to worry about and sort through.  Perhaps some of these could be present, but if so, I think it is really important that the complexity introduced be carefully structured such that the environment offered to Scratch beginners remains easy, natural and fairly complete. One of the things that Scratch encourages is combining efforts.  Yet with the features within Scratch, it can be hard to just throw projects together and have something that works and is understandable.  The skill and perception required to combine projects can be much higher than that required to write the individual projects.  Perhaps there are some clever integration techniques that could be added, since community projects seems to be an important aspect of the Scratch message."
3573,What a Seasoned Professional has to Learn from Scratch,4/28/10 0:31,"What I really wish Scratch had is the features in the BYOB 2 version of Scratch www.chirp.scratchr.org/blog/ or better yet the features of  BYOB 3 byob.berkeley.edu/. I think with the features availiable in BYOB the jump to higher languages would be easier and could be delayed because there would enough there to teach some of the higher concepts of computing (like recursion). I really, really like Scratch but I think some of the emphasis areas in 2.0 are off the mark. I don't think we need connectivity to Facebook and Twitter (egads !), I think we need a slight improved environment to teach CS concepts. But then being a computer scientist, I am a little biased."
3573,What a Seasoned Professional has to Learn from Scratch,4/28/10 10:06,"To add to Toby's list, I'd suggest looking at Greenfoot. It's a Java programming environment that provides a framework with a stage and sprites (""actors"") so you can quickly build interactive games or stories like those can build in Scratch. But the code is real Java -- complex syntax and all -- and you can use all the Java API's. Another cool language is JavaScript. It's interactive, fairly simple, and it's built into most browsers. I haven't looked for any step-by-step tutorials, but I'm sure they must exist. By the way, Scratch *is* programming. While Scratch doesn't require that you master the syntax of a text-based programming language, the program logic is exactly the same as C, Java, Python. In fact, Scratch is used in courses at Harvard, The College of New Jersey, and elsewhere as an introduction to those languages. From all reports, Scratch works very well in these courses because its constructs *are* so similar to other languages. -- John"
3573,What a Seasoned Professional has to Learn from Scratch,4/28/10 13:00,"I do lots and lots and lots of JavaScript at my ""real"" job.  I also do quite a bit of Java and C#, too. Java and C# are enough alike that if you write Java code with a ""C""-like syntax, it will probably become C#, more or less.  (Sure, I'm skipping over some differences such as delegates and anonymous functions, etc.) Javascript (more properly ECMAScript these days) is very different in practice than either of those.  It's more interpretive and less strongly-typed.  Javascript is easy to write and hard to debug, which I think is the opposite of what beginners need (and even often us pros, I think).  In my opinion, there aren't any really effective debuggers for Javascript.  The closest ones are Firebug and MyEclipse, but it is still not like the relevant, right-on-top-of-it, debugging of Visual Studio for C# and Visual Basic or Eclipse for Java. I'm sure there are several interesting environments around like Scala and the ones you mention that I haven't really checked out.  But if you want to have fun learning programming with an accepted ""professional"" langauge, I think one viable possibility is to use Microsoft's C#/XNA.  It's free and you can even run your code on the XBox (with XBox membership cost).  There's even a community.  Tutorials abound.  Just Google a phrase like:  C# XNA tutorial .  Some are for those with experience.  Some video tutorials are for beginners and most are oriented around making games.  And if you don't like being in the Microsoft world, remember that nearly all of your C# skills transfer very well to Java.  That said, C#/XNA is an adventure more for an interested high-schooler than the casual 2nd-5th grade Scratchers that I teach. Regarding an earlier discussion, I personally don't worry much about whether one learns recursion, but I think that object-oriented programming is an important concept.  Some of that comes through in Scratch, partly from its SmallTalk heritage.  I miss things like creating objects on the fly more than I miss recursion.  I even miss such niceties as passing parameters or being able to direct a ""broadcast"" to a more specific audience of listeners.  I think that these latter two features, though, could be added to Scratch in an optional, structured way that would not hurt the simplicity and clarity of Scratch as we know it."
3573,What a Seasoned Professional has to Learn from Scratch,4/28/10 15:59,"I agree that in naming missing elements that are missing from Scratch, recursion is probably a poor choice. That being said. BYOB is really cool.  It definitely addresses additional computing concepts without adding a huge number of new language elements. They have a ""video"" that demonstrates what BYOB 3 does and it is well worth a look. Even if these elements never make it into the official Scratch, BYOB is still there.The only real drawback is students lose the ability to publish to the web. I totally agree that Scratch is a real programming environment. I have not had this much fun creating software in years ! Now if I could only figure out a way to make a living teaching Scratch to students or educators, I'd be set !"
3573,What a Seasoned Professional has to Learn from Scratch,5/2/10 9:32,"Help me understand more of the programming concepts you mention: What are passing parameters, and how is ""creating an object on the fly"" different than programming a sprite?"
3573,What a Seasoned Professional has to Learn from Scratch,5/2/10 21:49,"Passing parameters (sometimes called arguments):  In mathematics, this would resemble in many ways a function call.  I'll try to do a Scratch-like example: Let's say we had a project with some fish in an aquarium and we wanted to tell them to change their color.  In Scratch now, we could make up broadcast messages such as ""Fish turn green"", ""Fish turn red"", ""Fish turn blue"", etc.  We'd have a different broadcast message for each color.  If there were lots of colors that we wanted to have the fish become, we'd have a lot of messages.  And if there was a situation where we couldn't anticipate what color we wanted for the fish, we'd be in trouble because we can't just define a new broadcast message ""on the fly"". But both of these problems would go away if we could attach ""parameters"" to a broadcast message.  I'm inventing syntax here, but for instance perhaps Scratch could let us say: Broadcast ""Fish change color"" with ""green"" or Broadcast ""Fish change color"" with ""blue"".  or even better Broadcast ""Fish change color"" with ""Variable: Favorite Color"".  Then we need only one broadcast message and we are able to create variations of the same message by using parameters. Now you can simulate this to a large degree now by having a variable that hold the new fish color and making the broadcast message say:  ""Fish, look at the new fish color now"".  That has much the same effect, but it is a two step process and in some ways is harder to follow in the code. Creating objects ""on the fly"":  Let's say that we made a project where we asked the player ""How many lightning bugs would you like to see flying around randomly?"".  They'd say some number and then what would we do?  Well, if we had made enough lighting bug sprites to match their largest possible number, we could just ""show"" the appropriate number and ""hide"" the others.  But that is sort of a pain because we have to make a large number of sprites and set up a script for each one.  It would be much easier if we could just say, in effect, ""Clone a new lighting bug sprite just like (the original Sprite name goes here).""  In object-oriented programming, we would call this an ""instance"" of the ""lightning bug sprite object"".  So now the number of sprites that we have on the screen is no longer limited to the number that we define before running our project."

3573,What a Seasoned Professional has to Learn from Scratch,5/3/10 20:05,"Parameters are a fairly fundamental facility in almost all computer languages. An example of a parameter is the values that a block takes to decribe what it does, like turn degrees ( being a parameter). It would be nice to be able to send parameters in messages broadcasts or by some other facility. Creating an object on the fly would be defining say ""Sprite 1"" and then having blocks in the program that says make me another sprite just like ""Sprite 1"". This would create a new sprite that acts just like the old sprite but is an entirely new sprite.  Unfortunately this would open up a Sorcerer's Apprentice situation where a large number of sprites could be created which would crash the Java Applet  and comsume a large amount of availiable ram."

But I feel that it will be easier to identify the bad stuff (and then pair it with the holy version). So, what are the worst things that we see in your projects ? I beleive that those qualify: - leaving instructions floating in the script zone - attaching the scripts to the wrong sprite (there we are: I can tell that it is the wrong sprite - but it is much harder to tell the right one, isn't it?) - undue nesting of conditions ... thanks,"

9388,What are the worst Scratch programming practices ?,4/22/11 12:51,"- Lack of comments in the scripts - Lack of information to the user regarding what to do - When errors occur, not only to tell the user so but also how to fix them. - Forgetting to initialize variables before using them. - Variable names that do not reflect their contents. (Using i, j or k for counting variables, for instance, is acceptable, but otherwise variable names should be realted to the program and the values they carry) - Some students prefer to use: if condition then end if if not condition then end if Instead of the if/else structure. Using ""if/if not"" may be acceptable initially, but students should eventually transition to ""if/else."" Two problems with the ""if/if not"" are a) sometimes students do not negate the condition in the second ""if"" statement, but they write the opposite condition themselves, and they do not do so incorrectly. For example, ""If x < 10"" and ""if x > 10"" as the replacement for ""else""... the case ""x=10"" is in limbo. b) There may be actions in the first conditonal that may also trigger the second conditional. I do not have a ""real life"" example in mind right now, but the following illustrates the idea. if x > 10 then ....x = x-5 end if if x <=10 then ....do something else here end if We can easily see that if, for example, x = 12 both conditionals become true! - Recycling variables to hold different types. (This can be a really bad habit which needs to be fixed before they move on to other languages (like Python) in which variable declarations are not needed, making matters worse.) What I mean with this is that, in some parts of the application a variable holds, say, a number, and later on a string is assigned to the same variable. - Forgetting the ""stop script"" block at the end of a script. We know Scartch stops scripts automatically, but since the block exists, we should use it. My hope is that getting used to ending scripts with this block will help students in the future remember to close open files, close socket connections, close database connections, etc. (I can dream, can't I) If I can think of something else, I will post it. Thanks"
9388,What are the worst Scratch programming practices ?,4/23/11 11:36,"Hi Angel, I have never required my students (grades 3-6) to use the comment part of Scratch becuase I didn't like how they were displayed and I think students would have a hard time explaining their code beyond reading through their blocks. What age group do you work with? How do you introduce comments? Also, I have never thought to instruct students to use the stop script block when their code naturally ends. Mostly, because a lot of what my students create .. never ends. It is an interesting thought though. Do you explain that it stops anyways? How do you go about explaining the need for this block? I have thought of stop script more of a break statement and not a file close. Maybe I have been misleading myself. Susan"
9388,What are the worst Scratch programming practices ?,4/25/11 1:07,"Hi Susan, I teach kids quite a bit older than yours. Using comments can be a great tool to help students plan (design) their scripts once they learn the basics of using Scratch. Think for example of someone learning woodworking: you first learn how to measure, cut, sand, make joints, select wood pieces, etc. Once you have this basic level of mastery, you then move on to know how to make furniture, cabinets, etc. However, you would probably will not start making a chair without at least a basic scketch of what the chair is going to look like, what wood to use, what dimensions and so on. The way I see it, there are two main kinds of comments students should get used to. One that we use to explain how something was implemented. The idea here is to communicate to others (or to ourselves, for future reference) about how a fragment of code came to be. Sometimes, we have a complex nested conditional structure, a tricky ""repeat until"", an intricate broadcasting system, or just a ""bunch"" of blocks trying to achieve a simple logical task in our program (for example, drawing the outline of a pine tree using the ""move"", ""turn"" and the pen blocks in the context of a winter scene). These are all great candidates to be documented. If something took a lot of (trivial) work to achieve, or effort to figure out, it should be documented. (Superfluous comments, however, should be avoided.) The other kind of comments are related to the planning of the program. These are like the actions in a cooking recipe (e.g., ""whisk the eggs and sugar"" is a good comment for the set of steps needed to complete this task). I use them to oultine the different (high-level) actions a sprite is going to do. These comments can also be the result of a brainstorming session with the students about what the sprites should do, and in what order. The comments also help in keeping track of what has been implemented, and what is yet to be done.  I attach these comments to their corresponding ""When"" blocks or to the first block implementing the action described in the comments. It is very tempting to start throwing blocks at scratch and see what it does, and this is Ok when experimenting or learning new blocks. However, whenever you are building an application with the students (in a tutorial, for example), I think it is a good idea to provide an overall picture of what you are trying to do by using comments to describe the high-level actions your application will take. When assigning projects, you could have the students first describe what they want to achieve using comments. You can then check their ""plans"" and point out things that are missing, not clear, or just need a different approach."
9388,What are the worst Scratch programming practices ?,4/28/11 6:00,"I was afraid that a topic like this one would come up sooner or later, and that we're going to indoctrinate kids with what we as adults are considering to be ""best practices"", a term which in itself suggests an unhealthy dose of ideology. Whenever I see a project on the Scratch website that truly amazes me, looking at the code is a bit of a downer, because it's usually full of gargantuan run-on scripts, global variables, forever loops and race conditions. But - and that's my point - the project impressed me so much that I wanted to look at its code in the first place. Scratch is cool precisely because kids can produce programmed content right away, without first having been instructed in what to avoid and what to adhere to. Sure, more often that not the code is plain ugly, but - and that's my point - that doesn't stand in their way to create and share. So, you don't *have* to initialize variables in Scratch. Nothing breaks of you don't, they're initially zero. You don't *have* to use the green flag hat block, in fact, I often don't. Instead you can use - say - a mouse click or a keyboard event to trigger things (and to initialize and reset values). It's okay to leave un-hatted blocks or incomplete stacks ""floating"" around the scripting area, because you can use them to debug your project (by double clicking on them) or as a quarry for features you might want to add later. It's also perfectly okay to nest conditions if that makes it easier for you to keep track of your reasoning, instead of using - equally(!) - nested predicates. The ""stop script"" block's *only* raison d'etre is to terminate a perpetual loop  in case a stop condition has been met, surely not to end a script that just plain ends. What's wrong with using just ""if""? Often times you plain don't need an ""else"" case. So kids produce stacks of if conditions instead of deeply nested If/Else ones. I can make out performance issues with this, but OTOH I'd rather read a stack of simple conditions than a cluttered mess of nested ones. So, Scratch variables don't need to be ""declared"" (in fact, they do, when you ""make a variable""), but they are not restricted to a certain type, and can store either a number or a string (or, in BYOB, even lists, sprites and blocks). Is it really ""bad practice"" in the adult world to exchange a variable's value with a differently typed other one? Most modern programming languages let you do this, Scratch itself is written largely that way, and it's awesome (plus, it undoubtely works!) :-) Most of what's ugly in the Scratch projects I'm talking about is rooted in Scratch's inability to allow for user-defined procedures. This deficiency forces kids into a copy & paste metaphor of creating code which is so hard to edit later on. But I understand that this issue is being addressed by the Scratch Team in their current rewrite for v2.0. Until then, let's not tell kids what's ""right"" or ""wrong"" and let's asses other programming languages for why so many of them cannot cope with ""child-like"" practices that are easily handled by Scratch. Let's press those other languages to become more like Scratch! ;-) --Jens"
9388,What are the worst Scratch programming practices ?,4/29/11 14:30,"I understand your point and pretty much agree with it. I use these 'best practices' to show students how they can improve their projects. If you cannot convince them that what you propose makes their scripts better, then they will not use it. There is nothing wrong with teaching students to organize and tidy-up things. I also have another goal in mind. After Scratch, my students move to a non-graphical language in which, for example, indentation and variable types matter. So, I want to make them aware of things issues to help them with the transition."
9388,What are the worst Scratch programming practices ?,7/7/11 10:30,"On Nested If's: I agree with Jens comment: ""I'd rather read a stack of simple conditions than a cluttered mess of nested ones.""  Readability trumps performance in my mind for kids just starting to learn.  The question I ask is which better facilitates understanding? Talking To Yourself (A Good Habit): I like to have kids read their code out loud.  Especially when trying to debug a problem.  I will also ask them to explain what each tile will do and at times point/draw/explain what will happen when that particular block executes.  Early in my career, I had a mentor tell me to ""think like a computer"" and later in my career I had someone suggest I code out loud to try and understand what it does.  I was amazed at how much reading out loud helped me. For one it slowed down my thinking and forced me to focus line by line instead of imagining what the next large chunk of code would do. I was often wrong when I guessed, especially since when I started to guess because it wasn't doing what I expected, I had the wrong mental model/image of what was going on. First Do the simplest thing possible to make it work, then refactor -  Kids are motivated to get someting to do what they want (play a game, imitate Mario Bros, etc). Now the question is once they accomplished what they care about, how do you get them to the ""hard fun"" and have them refactor (which I will define as: clean up their code to improve readability, reduce complexity and increase maintainabilty)? Good quesiton, suggestions welcomed ;) As they now have accomplished their goal, what is the point (ie: why should the kids care, if it does the same thing).  One way I try and deal with this is if multiple kids are working on the same task and one accomplishes it with a ""more elegant"" script, is to have the the one kid show their script to the rest of the class. I may then also add specific words and comments as to why I like that script and how it is much better than one I wrote (I always try to make myself the fool as opposed to one of the kids, plus it comes naturally to me ;) User Defined Procedures/Blocks: Amen.  This is really needed.  Also something akin to siblings in Etoys where sprites share a common script (but the variable values can be different) would be very useful and avoid the copy and paste we are teaching (a really Bad Habit, I see too often, and I'm not talking about kids I am talking about ""professional programmers"".)

Yes, it is hard to get the kids to put back their code on the workbench for the sake of ""easthetic"" improvement.  I wonder if I should try to get them to read their code a couple of weeks later, to get them to experience how hard it is to decipher programmer's intentions  ""from the outside"", therefore persuading them that a bit of tyding is useful. To all: thanks for your contributions - despite my silence I have been watching this and hopefully will incorporate this in my next classes !"
9388,What are the worst Scratch programming practices ?,10/14/11 12:15,"I agree with most of the thoughts about good and bad practices here, except one. Commenting your code is a practice that is never too early to implement. Commenting the code makes the code more readable; not only for the coder, but for anyone who reads it. Have you ever looked at a Scratch project that had no comments in the code? Was you able to follow it; to understand what was happening? I'm sure some people can, but not everyone will be as familiar with the code. Coding comments also helps the coder throughout their coding processes.  Have you ever stopped in the middle of a project, only to find when you came back you had to refresh your memory about what you were doing and what you wanted to do next? Along with commenting the code, I also have students keep a journal for each project which will contain the basic concept for their project, notes, questions, needs, and a psuedocode workup. Another great reson for code commenting is your students are using/improving thier language skills."
9388,What are the worst Scratch programming practices ?,7/9/12 22:51,"I'm a little late getting to this thread, but if anyone is still interested... In my colllege CS courses I tell my students that any time I'm tempted to put a comment in my own code, I take that as a sign that I should rewrite that section of code instead, to be less clever. This isn't because I don't want program documentation.  But I want it to be high-level, a text file separate from the program that explains its data structures, the large structure of the program, the user interface, and so on.  Along with reasons, if known, why things are organized this way rather than some other way. None of that lends itself to inline comments in the code. As for the other things, I agree with Jens that for kid programmers (up through age 18 or so) there's no such thing as a bad programming practice.  There are better programming practices, and sometimes I'll try to teach one to a particular kid.  But presenting kids with the sort of list of commandments attempted in this thread just makes programming skool, instead of being fun."
9388,What are the worst Scratch programming practices ?,2/10/13 8:15,"Whenever possible code should be self documenting and require a minimal number of comments.... (As code gets older these comments will often get copied and then the code underneath modified away from the original meaning). A functional call with a descriptive name is often better than a comment.  Having said that, any time you make assumption you should document them with comments... Here is a typical monolithic program with everything in one procedure....It is documented with comments, but compare it with below... Here is a more modularized approach... The main routine is shorter and you only need to concern yourself with the external calls if there is a problem in that code, and then you have a smaller chunk of code to deal with.  Incidentally, this code is just to illustrate a point, it can certainly be improved.. Also if you are using BYOB, do yourself a favor and create this block (it is just a function block named ""//"" with a text input field): It will allow you to insert comments in blocks or anywhere."

349,What is a story?,7/17/09 16:31,I really enjoyed the story telling with Scratch. It was fun and funny. So far the work I have done with students has all been games and I have worked with math teachers to create them. I can now see ways to incorporate Scratch into a language arts classroom. I especially enjoyed the way we switched computers to continue the story. I think that would be a great project to do next year. All of my 8th graders have used Scratch. Now I can go into a 9th grade English class and use it to tell a story. I think that would be a great way to show kids the connections between disciplines.
349,What is a story?,7/17/09 16:37,"So...a story is a group of words that has a beginning (introduction of the topic), a middle( development of the plot) and an end( some sort of conclusion or . (WOW!, that was so simplistic) Story starters get the reader hooked on continuing on and the middle of the story is the develpoment of the idea and the end just brings closure,  in some way to the events. I was very interested in learning to create stories in scratch. I love the idea of combining a curricular goal with a computational goal or learning experiment. Having said that, I am a bit stuck on how to keep the focus on writing and yet let them explore and have fun creating an animated story that is captivating to the reader. So, does scratch expand or limit the goal of storytelling.....HMMMMM? I think in some ways it is limiting because you spend so much time trying to get the characters to do what you want them to do, the content is lost. BUT, I also can see that stories can be brought to life and developed by being able to animate and be very creative about the story telling. Ideas from the story may come from the programming of the characters themselves. I need to think about how to use scratch for storytelling. I love the idea but I am unclear about how to proceed."

Unfortunately, I haven't been able to support our writing curriculum due to the fact that I see students once a week for 50 minutes blocks.

I envision Scratch as an avenue to champion writing in a different format. This is great for modification and differentiation. As a side benefit, I do not feel that the students will think that it is a long and drawn out process to go from start to completion within the Scratch format, even if it takes them a month."
349,What is a story?,7/17/09 16:55,I think Scratch can expand what it means to tell a story for many people. The graphics and animations can help people express ideas in another way.

349,What is a story?,7/17/09 16:58,"I was especially interested in using scratch to tell stories. At my school we have many projects that we ask the students to create stories based on content knowledge they have learned through their research. We teach them research skills and how to present their information as a research paper. Then they are asked to teach their classmates about their their topic in the form of a story, the story is to both inform and entertain. This involves loads of creativity and they must script it out before sitting down at the computer - this project can easily be adapted to Scratch. We currently use PhotoStory and it works very well. But, now that I know (sort of) how to use scratch, I plan on having them use scratch for their second storytelling project. Their final projects are shared with the entire class and then posted on our moodle site for others to see. By posting the the scratch website, their audience will be so much larger! Scratch is more powerful than PhotoStory!"

I have to admit that I am not the most creative person so searching through the backgrounds and sprites really helped me come up with ideas for my story.  I think this would really help students who also struggle when asked to think up an original story .  The collaborative story undertaking was my favorite part of the conference so far.  I loved seeing how my story developed and this process again would help anyone who has a hard time thinking of a story idea, since the beginning or middle of the story has already been created .  I think students would feel the same excitement that we did when viewing what our colleagues had done with our stories and I definitely plan on trying out this project with students during the upcoming school year."

349,What is a story?,7/18/09 7:00,"I agree that using Scratch to create ""a product"" that synthesizes and incorporates information gathered during the research process would be a great library activity.  To overcome time constraints, it could be a shared project between language arts, computer, (all the disciplines-for that matter), and library.

349,What is a story?,7/18/09 7:25,"Finally (I like lotteries, too!) I agree that the variety of the sprites and their expressions, the backgrounds and the whole process encourage a more free flowing, fun process of story unfolding. I guess using a story board to preplan each step would be another approach, and I am sure a lot of preplanning goes into smany of the projects (in the gallery), but it was fun to interact with the given characters and the pieces that the other group members had added.

But I have now added that idea that computational thinking includes seeing the world and expressing myself in new ways using the computer. It also includes creative collaboration ... or is that thinking creatorate or collabreate?"

338,What is computational thinking?,7/16/09 11:24,"Computational thinking is using computers or technology to better understand something. It is also using computers or technology to express or share your thoughts or your understanding of something. But, having seen what Anne Marie wrote - I am thinking that she is correct in saying that it is thinking logically and using a step by step process. Hmmm - maybe it isn't necessarily tied to computers or technology."
338,What is computational thinking?,7/16/09 11:26,I think Computational Thinking is thinking about how to solve a complex problem or task by breaking it down into a sequence of simple tasks.  It also includes thinking about the efficiency and effectivness of different methods to solve the same problem.
338,What is computational thinking?,7/16/09 11:29,"My first thought was BASIC - IF THEN.  My second thought was higher order thinking, working all the way up from the raw zeros and ones to the how, why and what ifs using a computer and its tools along the way."
338,What is computational thinking?,7/16/09 11:28,"My first reaction to the word computational is to think about numbers and alogrithms and rote learning. I have to shift my connotation of the word ""computational."" Having taught 6th grade math for many years, the coputational component was the least creative part of teaching math - and I didn't really enjoy it. I understand that in this context, computational thinking is a more open ended creative way of working through a problem. It is a way of puting something in a process and getting something else out and thinking through the steps of getting the idea from one place to another. From the talk Mitch gave today, I understand that it is a new type of literacy that includes ""Learning through Designing,"" ""Building on Personal Interests"" and ""Collaborating Creatively."" -Liz"

338,What is computational thinking?,7/16/09 13:34,"What is computational thinking? My first reaction was that it involved solving problems, math problems, a way of viewing how numbers effected and affected our lives.  My view now is that computational thinking is evolving into a broader environment."
338,What is computational thinking?,7/16/09 11:29,"Computational thinking is reflecting then performing activities in a logical order.  This morning we saw a demonstration to encourage our students to create book reports, animate objects, create geography learning tools and even conduct science projects and research using Scratch."
338,What is computational thinking?,7/16/09 13:44,"When Mitch asked us to state our initial thoughts about computational thinking, mine were: Thinking logically, planning, mapping out a strategy, cause/effect, animation, data collection and analysis and communicating. After this morning's introduction, tour, and reflections, I find my own thinking incorporating more and changing. One of my school's motto is that we need to stay ""green and growing."""

I like the idea of learning about some of the computer science concepts, for those of us who do not dwell in the computer/math world as much. I like the problem solving approach and teh emphasis on play and fun. I have always thought that the ways of the old style kindergarten class should be applied to all levels.  Learn about computational thinking first with hands on activities!"

I will try to answer based on my 25 years with various programming languages and make the following points : 1) Trying to anticipate what the software user  may do and designing the proper response and then learning from trial and error what should be done to make your software - Almost Perfect - is a very  useful process that teaches the young ones many planning lessons. 2) The value of sticking to good variable names and nice structures in the long run, rather than the instant gratification of quick-and-dirty programming can be demonstrated with ease. 3) The balance between what I call nice/elegant/structured coding and fast accurate answers is usually a very quick lesson in being practical. and much more.."
338,What is computational thinking?,2/27/10 0:28,Karen what an interesting question you have brought up.  I was not at the talk so my response lacks the contextual framework in which your quotation was used.  All the same I am fascinated by the term computational.  On the one hand it refers to computation.  That is something that has been going on for thousands of years.  On the other hand the word computer is infused in that adjective today.  I don't think you can talk about computational thinking without thinking about the flood of data that exists in the world today.  I really like how Tim Berners-Lee talks about it on TED. www.ted.com/talks/tim_berners_lee_on_the_next_web.html Ultimately it is up to computers and people thinking computationally to handle this new world order.  What better argument can you make to start children learning computer programming at an early age?

9762,What to call flow of control with 3rd - 6th graders?,5/18/11 14:07,"I was thinking today about the way in which I talk about flow of control with my students. I usually say things like: ""it"" goes here, or ""it"" does not go here, or ""it"" only goes here if this is true. I have been trying to come up with better ways to say ""it"" which would have more meaning to younger students. Does anyone have any ideas? Single stepping in Scratch helps but I would love any suggestions of other words to use instead of ""it"". Thanks for any/all contributions!"
9762,What to call flow of control with 3rd - 6th graders?,5/20/11 1:50,"Using the analogy of recepies and cooks, the ""CPU"", or even ""the computer"", follows the instructions in the script and every time it encounters a conditional statement, it has to decide which set of instructions to follow next based on the validity of the condition. I can live with that. The CPU is the one that actually ""goes"" here or there by changing the value of its program counter --different architectures use different schemes, but the idea is the same. In a x86-based architecture, for example, a conditional statement ends up as a series of instructions for evaluating the condition, a comparison instruction (CMP), the selection of the right course of action using one of the many jump-on-condition instructions available (like, JNE for ""jump if not equal"") and possibly using an unconditional jump (JMP) for implementing the ""Else"" part of the conditional (anyone remembers assembly language?). I once had a professor that used to say ""and the program goes here if the condition is True."" This was very peculiar to me as programs, like recepies, are passive elements (Ok, putting self-modifying programs aside for the moment) and as such ""they"" do not do anything. One funny thing that always comes up, is that some students would end-up blaming the CPU when something goes wrong in their programs not realizing that ""they"" told ""it"" to do exactly ""that."""

In my opinion, it depends on the age group and extent of exposure/familiarity of the student to related computing knowledge. If the person is much much younger, or if s/he is a beginner, then that is exactly what I would say. It preserves the programming concept and yet does not overload the beginner with too much ""unnecessary"" info. I create and step through projects with beginners on my Scratch resource site - you're most welcome to see how I talk about about ""it"" there: FunWithScratch.org"

37703,Why Kids Create Games,10/26/15 13:57,"I'm curious about the impulses that underlie children's drive to create games (in a variety of platforms, including Scratch), especially children ages 6-9. The factors I've seen in my own teaching seem to include: creating a game that is optimally hard to win, for the creator creating a game that is relatively easy for the creator to win creating a world a personally meaningful/interesting style and having total control over the game design and structure creating a game that challenge or otherwise impress a friend/sibling What else do you think is going on? What percentage of kids do you think want total control, to start with a blank slate? And what portion want to start with something like a template that they can tweak? Let me know what you think!"

584,Word Cloud in Scratch?,8/23/09 12:27,"What an interesting and challenging question! My instinct is that you could do it with Scratch, but it might not be too easy. I wrote a little parser that shows how you could build a list from a collection of words provided as keyboard input. You could then create another list to count duplicates. As for drawing the word cloud, the only thing I can think of off the top of my head is that you'd either use the pen to draw letters or you could have a sprite (or costume) for each letter. You'd build up words by stamping sprites on the stage - like Jay does in this project. I hope that helps. When I was just getting started with Scratch, I found the Scratch website really helpful. I looked at lots of different projects and downloaded the projects to see how they were made --  it gave me a better understanding of what you can do with Scratch. Thanks, K"

My answer was of course there are ways to program iPhone’s and the like, but the better solution is to write Scratch programs on these devices. Scratch programs are not only easy enough for her and her students to develop in, but they can be easily configured for each student’s needs. Now that I speak as the expert, I am in trouble, because I don't know what devices Scratch can either be developed on or just run on? I know there is work being down with Android, but I have no idea how far Google has advanced with this venture.

The relationship between Scratch and AppInventor are rather strong (see http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2010/android-abelson-0819.html and this dicussion http://scratched.media.mit.edu/discussions/news-and-announcements/googles-app-inventor). AppInventor behaves just like Scracth with more advanced programming features, access to phone features (e.g. sms) and it is easy to create market-ready apps (at least a lot simpler than going the Java + Android SDK route). Hope this helps."

10081,"Working with Scratch on smart devices (androids, iphones, etc.) for Special Education Students",7/4/11 16:17,"Angel, Thanks for the response and references. I spent the day reading everything that I could. If I perhaps get a small number of Androids loaded with goggles-app-inventor for the Sped department I think we’d be set. Unfortunately, it is impossible to be positive without speaking to the SPED person at school, but my guess is the Androids are already loaded with all the big organizational app’s that these kids need. What they need and would love to do is to create small personalized programs.  It would be terrific to have the special education students teaching the main stream students how to program creatively. Your information helped me prioritize and organize my work for the summer. The first important task is to start MIT’s Open course MAS.962 Autism Theory and Technology. Again, thanks for the help, Vicki"
29371,Workshop for 2nd grader using Scratch,9/24/14 17:15,"Hi Scratch Community, I am a software engineer and a parent volunteer at my child's elementary school.  I signed up to do a 1 day (1-2 hour) workshop with my child's class (2nd grade) during regular school hours teaching any subject of my choice.  Since I am a software engineer, I decided to teach the kids some type of computer programming.  When I went to Oracle Java's website for suggestions, ""Scratch"" came up as the recommended language for young children for that age group.  After looking into Scratch briefly, I realize that it's a great app/language for the kids and am thrilled to have found it. However, I am not a teacher.  Although I have some ideas on what to teach the kids, I am hoping to find a curriculum or a workshop lesson plan here.  For example, in a 1-2 hours workshop, what's the best way to pique their interest so perhaps they can continue on their own later on?  Is it better to just ""teach"" the whole time, or should the kids be given an assignment to create a very basic program?  The class (of 25) does have 9 iPads at all time, and I have a feeling I can borrow some more from the other classrooms if I have to, or they can take turns. Any suggestion or recommendation (lesson plans will be even better!!) will be really appreciated!  If the kids enjoy it, I may even ask the teacher to let me make this a recurring class that I teach (perhaps once every month or every two months) since I know the school loves anything STEM. Thank you so much!"

As the previous member replied if you want to use tablets you have to use SCRATCH Jr. which is a also a great program. SCRATCH 1.2 is an installable file that you can download and install onto Windows/Mac machines - it will not work in a Chromebook either. Our curriculum is created in a tiered manner so children at all ages and abilities will be able to try out different lessons and challenges and we have a lesson plan book that they and you can use.

The workshop is designed for K-12 teachers who want to bring Scratch (or computational thinking more broadly) into their classrooms. It's structured as an introduction to programming for people who also like photography — but you don't have to be a ""photographer"" to join us! Lessons will explore Scratch and digital photography as a way to make interactive collages, games, stories and puzzles. In discussions and reflections we'll ask how learning to program a computer fits in the K-12 curriculum, and share ideas for lesson plans that teachers can adapt to their own classrooms."
579,Workshop: Helping People Get Started with Scratch,8/22/09 21:04,"We just announced a free workshop that will be taking place Saturday, September 26 from 1-4pm at MIT Media Lab.

10553,WORKSHOP: Teaching Kids Programming with Scratch & Kinect - Oct. 22 at Carnegie Mellon,9/12/11 17:30,"A unique workshop for teachers, parents, and kids (ages 8 and up)! This workshop by Stephen Howell will provide the means by which anybody age 8 and up can develop their own interactive motion-capture games for the Kinect! Using Kinect2Scratch (a free bridging library developed by the presenter), the workshop will demonstrate 5-minute game creation with the free Scratch language, and provide methods for interfacing Kinect “skeleton” data (the users’ body joints) into Scratch programs. Many primary and secondary schools have no formal programming instruction at any level, and evangelizing computational thinking and logical problem-solving is a major challenge. Scratch, a free educational tool from MIT, addresses this by framing computer programming as a curiosity-driven, arts-oriented, creative activity — in a “building block” environment which students and teachers can learn very easily. More than 2 million programs, many of which are interactive games, have been written and shared by young people using the Scratch language. The Kinect depth sensor offers young programmers enticing possibilities for new forms of game design, but as C# and C++ are not languages in which they are likely to be skilled, kids can’t easily write code for the Kinect. Until now. With Scratch, a Kinect, and the bridging software provided in this workshop, a teacher can have a class writing motion-capture based games very quickly!

1822,"Yes, totally amazing - camspace",12/4/09 13:15,"Hi Today a young student ,12 yrs, gave me a little hint of website called camspace. You can use a webcam to track things and use the tracking to a mousemove... I´ve had a two hour scratchclass with the students. And he had of course downloaded Scratch. And today he gave me the tip about camspace. I tried it when I came home.. and yes, it did the tracking.... I tried to use a small colored paper to be tracked and made a small scratchprogram with mouse x/y and I managed to move my scratchsprite with the colored paper... So I couldn´t resist to write in this forum... :) Now you can track everything, and use it in your scratchprogram. Every day has something new to be explored, Anders"

11269,Your Input Needed to Create Scratch Jr.,12/13/11 17:01,"Hello Teachers, I am working with Tufts University in conjunction with the MIT media lab to create a new Scratch Jr. aimed for children from preschool - second grade. As part of the external evaluation team, I am interested in collecting some feedback and experiences from teachers who have used Scratch in the past with young children. At this phase in the research, I am hoping to speak to teachers who have used Scratch in a preschool - second grade classroom to find out what worked well with the program and what might need to be changed to create a more successful program for younger children. As a teacher myself, I understand how precious your time is. The ideal interview would be in the form of a phone interview which would last for about 20 minutes. If you are unable to speak on the phone, I would be more than happy to email you the questions for you to answer at your convenience. Interviews will typically be conducted in the afternoons and evenings, but ?I would be more than happy to fit with your schedule. ?I hope to complete these interviews by January 17, 2012. Please let me know if you are willing to participate in this interview. ? Thank you for your consideration, Katherine Schellie, M.A. ? Educational Specialist ? Ponte & Chau Consulting ?
