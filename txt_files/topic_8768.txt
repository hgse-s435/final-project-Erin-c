Hello Scratch fans Scratch Moodle Course - Beg borrow or barter to get one! I am new to Scratch but it looks great. I am looking into creating a Moodle course which will introduce Scratch to my Y7 pupils. I am looking at all the websites out there and am about to start to create a Moodle course which will have lesson by lesson tasks, link to video tutorials and allow them to upload some evidence of work. I see from so many posts that I this has been done many times! Will anyone let me have a zip file of their Moodle course! Or a guest login to see how others have done this? I can then base my course on this. I realise I am being cheeky but I already share Moodle courses as, I am sure you will agree, teachers have better things to do to do than re invent the wheel. Regards Michael Ps My Moodle courses are of available to anyone who want them!

Hi Michael, I searched for "moodle" on ScratchEd and found a number of people who are working with Scratch + Moodle. If you're still looking for Moodlers on ScratchEd, here are some links to people that I found in my search: http://scratched.media.mit.edu/resources/scratch-filter-moodle http://scratched.media.mit.edu/discussions/teaching-scratch/scratch-programming-online-education http://scratched.media.mit.edu/resources/story-telling-assignment http://scratched.media.mit.edu/resources/scratch-course-material-meridian http://scratched.media.mit.edu/user/373 http://scratched.media.mit.edu/discussions/how-do-i/screencasts-publish-youtube Hope that helps!

Hi Michael, Thank you for the guest access. I've just had a look at your Y7 and Y8 courses, but Moodle is asking for an enrollment key. Any ideas? Thanks, Richard

I have one on Blackboard that I can export as a common cartridge if someone is willing to try to import it. It has Cornell Notes that follow the design questions of the Scratch curriculum available here. Its not perfect, but would be a good place to start.
