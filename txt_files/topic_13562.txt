Hi everyone- If you joined us today at the workshop - thank you! If you couldn't come but would like to contribute your own Scratch Cards to the channel - thank you! Here is the link to the presentation outline. We did have a little glitch at the workshop with overwriting each other's cards and thanks to our new MInnesota friends, we think we know why it happened... see the last pages of the presentation that have some final notes. Please feel free to be in touch if you have any questions. When school starts this fall, I'll have a new group of animation students, but we'll be in Scratch after we do some initial drawing exercises and storyboarding and claymation stop-motion projects so if you're interested in skype video and sharing the process of making and posting Scratch Cards, we're interested and available to work with you! Thanks again Mitch and Karen and the Scratch team for making this "in real life" extension possible! Scratch Card Resources Presentation
