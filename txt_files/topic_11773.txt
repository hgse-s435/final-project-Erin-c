Recap Networking: Red, Yellow, Green - As they arrived, participants were given three cards, one red, one yellow and one green. Reflecting on the past month, each person was asked to share something from their teaching experience that was great (green), okay (yellow), and not so great (red). Breakout Session:Costumes and Drawing - Janet and Sandie led the whole group in a session exploring costumes. They demonstrated how to create a pencil in the paint editor and animate the pencil using the pen tool to simulate drawing a line. Then, with a suggestion from Karen, the group was challenged to explore different ways to use the change costume block to make the pencil tip look like it was wearing down while it drew the line.
