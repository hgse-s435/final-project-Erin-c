Hi, the European Week for Waste Reduction is coming, from 16th to 23rd November http://www.ewwr.eu/ Coderdojo Milan, Rome and Bologna, FubLab Bolzano, DIYTorino with three teachers of italian school, are developing resources about environmental education using Scratch. The developed resources will be used during this week and, later, uploaded on ScratchED.
