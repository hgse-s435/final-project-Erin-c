Hi group -- my goal (one of them) for Saturday is to hear about how folks are using the networking aspect of Scratch. I'm really interested in the way the social network aspect of Scratch can play into the construction process in a creative and collaborative way. Thanks!

I'm interested in discussing the topic that Sean proposes! I'm also hoping to get some help/feedback on a "Scratch Educator Census" that I'm putting together.

Thanks Sean, that's what I'm thinking about for my next year courses. It'd be great to hear others' responses.
