Would there be enough interest from people to go together on a bus from NYC to MIT for the day? It looks like a BOLT bus would be only about $25 dollars but a rented bus would go from a location in Manhattan right to the Scratch Day at MIT. Let me know if you'd be interested and how many people you would take!

On a related note, tickets for Scratch Day MIT are now available online at http://sdmit2011.eventbrite.com

Does this include lunch? I just need to tell my students' parents what the $10 is for.....

There will be a pizza lunch included.

great! We're trying to come! Thank you.
