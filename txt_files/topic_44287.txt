Hi. I will be teaching Scratch once a week, to 7th and 8th grade students (ages 12-14). I expect a few eyerolls when I introduce it, just because that's what kids their age do. But I want them to see for themselves that Scratch is really cool! Are there any videos that I can show them to get them excited about Scratch? How about games on Scratch -- where can I find sample ones that they'll really enjoy? Thank you.
