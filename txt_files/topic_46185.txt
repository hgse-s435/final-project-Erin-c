Want to try some new ways to get creative with coding? For this year's CSEdWeek (December 5-11), the Scratch Team is highlighting three project themes: Animate Your Name, Make It Fly, and Make Music. To get started, visit the new Things to Try page (scratch.mit.edu/go), which features a variety of project themes. For each project theme, you'll find: A step-by-step tutorial A set of illustrated activity cards An educator guide for organizing a one-hour Scratch workshop The resources are designed to support creative explorations with Scratch, helping young people learn to think creatively, reason systematically, and work collaboratively. We look forward to seeing what your students imagine, create, and share with Scratch. Scratch On! Christan, from the MIT Scratch Team
