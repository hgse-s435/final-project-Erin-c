Hi, Iam currently working with about 30 students (4th and 5th graders) on Scratch.I work at a PreK through 8 school in Newtown, Connecticut that is looking to collaborate with another school overseas.I amopen to several possibilities. One possibility is to create scratch projects to share with you and have you swap projects to share with us. OR even better, we would love to use the scratch site to collaborate to remix each other's projects to work together in creating projects between partners internationally. Please reply if you are interested conttact me at pgans@fraserwoods.com

Dear Patrice, We are working with Scratch in the Teachers school of the Basq Country University. Our students have made a lot of simple games to use with 3-5th graders. Here you have some works. All them are in basq language, but it would be interesting to know what do your students think (or what they want to know) about this projects. Olso we can translate some of them ;-). Regards, Jon. iktmagisteritza@gmail.com

Great idea Patrice! I'd love to hear about your collaborations. M
