Does anyone know if there will be an intensive seminar this summer at MIT for educators? My school is trying to figure out their budget and I would like to put in a request to attend if such a conference is taking place. Thank you!

Hi Alexis, We're just working out the details of summer offerings -- and we will be announcing events over the next several weeks. K

Hi, our country (Tunisia) is interested too! please we hope to know where and when?
