Ihave some questions regarding Scratch Design Studio, which is a feature of the Scratch website shown below: scratch.mit.edu/galleries/browse/clubbed My question is has anyone used ScratchDesign Studio as an educational tool and if so, which Design Studio themes did you find most effective or useful? If you have used it, can you please elaborate on what kind of setting you used it in-classroom setting, afterschool program, camp activity, etc. any thoughts would be beneficial. Thanks!
