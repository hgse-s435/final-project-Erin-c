Hi everyone, Hope you're having a fantastic Friday! I'll be presenting my first Hour of Code at our library next week, and had a question - for the project, I've chosen the "Make It Fly" activity.  However, our program is open to ages 5 to 10. I'm covered as far as grades 2-8 are concerned, but I'm not sure what to do about the K-1 crowd (if any show up). Are there any Scratch projects that are suitable for ages 5-6? I would use Scratch Jr., but we will be using laptops, not tablets. I thought about the 'Animate Your Name' activity as a possibility, even though it is for grades 2-8, because it looks so simple. But I want to make sure to choose the right activity for each age group. Any suggestions? Thank you very much!
