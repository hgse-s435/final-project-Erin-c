Hello, How do I turn off student commenting in the scratch teacher account? My students, although they're being taught constructive criticism, are commenting silly things and I don't want to lose access to my teacher account nor to theirs. If there is no way of turning off commenting, what suggestions does everyone in the scratch community recommend? Has anyone else run into this problem. Thanks.

Hi Karen, You can manually remove inappropriate comments and projects created by your students. Alternatively, a student has created a project which demonstrates how to turn off commenting. https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/91085353/ I'd also reccomend you check out the Teaching with Scratch Facebook Group and share this question to see what other educators have done! Best, Alexa
