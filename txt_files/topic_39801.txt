Hi, I'm new to ScratchEd but not new to Scratch. I would like to download the PacMan.sb file to my laptop to teach in a School but dont seem to be able to do this. Any help would be much appreciated. I do have the .pdf document, think the game is great and would really challenge my pupils. ?Thanks Mike

Hi Mike, It looks like the file wasn't named correctly. I've attached a new file and renamed it (sb2 is the extension for Scratch projects). http://scratched.gse.harvard.edu/resources/how-build-simple-pac-man-game#comment-5267 I hope this works! Best, Willa

Dear Wilhelmina, Thanks for such a quick response and the change you have made. But, I'm afraid you didn't mention how to actually download the file. I've just done a 'Save Target As' (is this correct?) which does allow me to download the file as an HTML but quite a bit of the maze is missing. Is this as it should be or is there a better option? Kind Regards Mike

Hi Mike, Sorry for the lack of explanation. If you download and save the file and then upload the file into Scratch, it should work. (In Scratch, click "create" > "file" > "upload from your computer") Let me know if that works. Best, Willa

Dear Wilhelmina, Sorry it must be me not explaining myself very well. How do you download the file, in simple steps please? Kind Regards Mike

Hi Mike, Apologies for misunderstanding your question. I'm not sure if this will help, but here's what I see when I click on the pacman.sb2 file: If I click "save file" it automatically dowloads. Let me know if this helps. Best, Willa
