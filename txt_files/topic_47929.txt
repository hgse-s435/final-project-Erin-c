Hello All, Does anyone have any suggestions of what format I should use to set up student accounts as I am trying to advise against using their real names as usernames.? I am setting up more than 200 students so I would need a format that is easy to display and set up. A format that would generally be used by all would be useful as students make accounts/passwords and then do not remember them. Thank you for your assistance! -Stacy
