Hi ScratchEd Team and Community, I've seen the hidden Sensor Board and WeDo blocks on Scratch 2.0. If you need beta testers, I'll be happy to help and I'm sure that you'll find in the ScratchED community a group of teachers willing to try them out. Do you think we can show something at the Scratch Conference in Barcelona? Thks Frank
