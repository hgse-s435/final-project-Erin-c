I am a PK-4 Elementary/PK-8 Special Educaiton major at Seton Hill University. I am also part of the Honors Program, and one of the requirements of the Honors Program is a Capstone Project. For this project, I have decided to introduce computer programming to students in the PK-4 grade range through Scratch and other programming software. This coming spring, a program for STEM for teachers is in the works and then a similar program for students will be done next fall. I'm really passionate about this and want to make it the best I can make it, which is why I want real world classroom uses. Here's where I need some help/guidance - I would like to know how you use Scratch or other programming software in your classroom so I get some ideas and real world applications of this skill to use for this project (and then take it to my future classroom!) Any help would be appreciated. Thanks!
