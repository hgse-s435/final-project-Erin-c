As a high school teacher, I need to be able to look at students work after it is completed. I had the students give me their user names and tried a few ways to find them in some of the posts, but to no avail. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you, Deb Houghton

Hi Deb, The web addresses for Scratch profile pages always follow the same pattern: https://scratch.mit.edu/users/USERNAME For example, my Scratch username is "cshell" so you can find my page at: https://scratch.mit.edu/users/cshell This should help you to find your students' work as long as they have shared it. It won't help if they didn't share it! Chris
