How to organise a Scratch competition but we have some problem in set up the category, competition rules and judge standard. Is there anyone can advise in this matter? 1. Team size- can individual and 2 person in team compete in a same category? 2. Judge standard- are 2 person team get higher marks than individual team because of their collaboration work? What are the special aspect or element judges need to consider? 3. The tool- are 2 person in team share one computer when they compete with individual competitor?
