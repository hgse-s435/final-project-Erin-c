Hi everyone, Please accept my sincerest apologies for the delay of the Scratch@MIT 2012 conference site availability. We've been having all sorts of problems with the Scratch servers. I'm hoping that the site will launch next week. We'll be adjusting the conference deadlines accordingly. Again, my apologies, K

Thanks Karen. Looking forward to seeing the information. PSrinivasan

Hi Pratibha, Karen and everybody else, The new site looking so tempting. My only problem now is how to raise money. At the last conference I experienced one of the best moments in my career as an ICT-educator/advisor. So many great ideas, so many amazing people and such a lovely town. I still carry the ideas and experiences in my mind and in my heart. Thanks for your awesome engagement... Anders, Sweden

I'd love to hear from other educators who brought students to present in past Scratch conferences. I'm going to talk to my students next week when we return to school but it feels hard to ask them to commit to something in July! How do you do it and who pays for the hotel and travel?

Is it possible to participate without presenting a paper ? Thanks

Definitely! 350 people will be attending and probably only 60 of those will be presenters. Hope to see you there!

Thank you. I hope to meet you all !
