We are pleased to announce Pyonkee. The world's first real Scratch 1.4 environment on iPad. Anyone can download it from App Store for free now. https://itunes.apple.com/en/app/pyonki/id905012686 Pyonkee is written by Masashi Umezawa and it is based on Scratch 1.4 Source Code from MIT Media Lab. So there is no Scratch cat, logo and project sharing feature (except emailing projects). Some Scratchers might remember John M. McIntosh's Scratch Viewer for iOS. That was removed from App Store by Apple four years ago. Pyonkee refers to JMM and other pioneers great works. Pyonkee's source code is available on GitHub. https://github.com/SoftUmeYa/Pyonkee Enjoy! Kazuhiro Abe Fellow, SoftUmeYa, LLC.
