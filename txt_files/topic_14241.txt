We thought you'd like to know that Animation13 - the 6th Annual UK Schools Computer Animation Competition, has launched! It's open now, for teacher registration, at animation.cs.manchester.ac.uk Animation13 is a free-to-enter, not-for-profit competition run by The University of Manchester, designed to enthuse young people about Computer Science. The competition is open to all UK schoolchildren aged 7-19. Teacher registration is free and carries no obligation to submit any entries. All registered teachers will receive free colour A2 Animation13 posters for their school, to be sent out in November. Entrants can create their animations (maximum duration: 1 minute) using any of the following programs: Scratch, Alice, Adobe Flash, Serif: Draw Plus, KoolMoves, SWiSH Max4 and Blender. There are great prizes, awarded at the Animation Festival and Inspirational Computer Science Day held at The University of Manchester on 12 July 2013. Last years Animation12 competition was bigger than ever, with over 870 entries from 180 schools across the UK. We awarded prizes to 58 students (working as individuals, or in groups) from 31 schools. You can see all the winning entries, and photos from our Awards and Inspirational Computer Science Day at animation.cs.manchester.ac.uk. Enquiries: animation@cs.man.ac.uk Animation12 is funded by Electronic Arts, in association with cs4fn. With best wishes! Toby
