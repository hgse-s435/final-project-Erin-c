Have some one use the scratch in teaching the preschool children? please anyone could share the curriculum for preschool children or any idea for the children with Scratch. anything is appreciation

Hi Zhou, Here is a thread on how to introduce Scratch to beginners. Some of the comments talk about sharing Scratch with younger children. This Classroom 2.0 Wiki also might have some ideas for lesson plans that are open to any age. Hope that helps a little. I'll let you know if I run into any preschool specific curriculum examples.

I just posted our new club's website here. Our club is for grade 1 to 6 and we have quite a few grade 1 kids. Maybe our material can help, although I think preschool is going to be different. www.parkstreetscratchclub.org P.K.
