Collab Challenge Today the Collab Challenge was announced on Scratch (see the top right corner if you're signed in, orhttp://info.scratch.mit.edu/collabchallenge ). We wanted to announce it here because it's a great opportunity to give kids motivation to work together to create a project. The only real constraints are that the project has to include three particular sprites and it has to be done as a team of at least 2 people. In addition, there are some dates to pay attention to. Wednesday, Feb. 9, is the deadline for participants to upload a project. The projects will receive constructive comments from the Scratch Design Team, and then everyone will have a chance to revise and polish their projects before the final deadline of Mar. 2. What a great opportunity to get feedback from the Design Team and to encourage kids to revise their work! For myself, I'm leading a small, informal workshop where we'll be doing the Collab Challenge as a focus of the group. It has both new and more experienced youth, and so far the kids seem excited. We hope many people will participate! Deborah
