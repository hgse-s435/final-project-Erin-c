Hi Guys, I really could do with some help and ideas here. I have an interview for teaching post in a school. During the interivew I have to teach a class of 12-13 year olds a lesson on scratch, the emphasis being on 'word language'. It can be assumed that the class have no pior knowledge on scratch or programming for that matter. Anybody have any suggestions how I can go about this and also can someone tell me what it means by emphaising the lesson 'word language'? Much appreciated. Thank you Zpatel
