The MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory will be collaborating in an ambitious four-year research effort to explore the use Scratch and App Inventor to foster programming knowledge and computational thinking for students in grades 4 through 6. The work will engage 20,000 students from 32 Hong Kong primary schools and several community organizations. It is sponsored by the Hong Kong Jockey Club Charities Trust. Other collaborators are the Hong Kong Institute of Education, City University of Hong Kong and Dalberg Global Development Advisors. As a result of launching this project, MIT has immediate staff openings for a post-doctoral associate, an educational researcher and a software engineer. This is a chance to contribute to a major research project on computational thinking aimed at significant impact in one of the world's great cities and beyond. ?Here are preliminary descriptions of the three staff positions, together with information on how to register interest to be notified when the formal job opens in a few days: Postd0ctoral associate: https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B3jsksMcCW5bWENrM2ZvQlgxOUU Research Scientist https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B3jsksMcCW5bWU11UVd4Q2ZHS3c Software engineer https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B3jsksMcCW5bVWZCQjZtTU5iUTA ?
