Hello, i'm interested in courses (a week-long or similar) where i might get in touch with the forefront in Scratch usage in education and other international educators. I especially search courses during my vacation period (June-August), possibly in the EU. If no courses in the EU, i can try to manage a travel to the US anyway. Thank you in advance !

Hi Roberto, One option in the US, we're hoping to be able to offer our Creative Computing workshop again --http://cs4hs.media.mit.edu/ If I hear of anything else, I'll be sure to pass it along! K

I have developed a 4 days teachers training on Scratch, if you wish to organize a group in the EU I can train you in June (I live in Israel). In the mean time, here is a link to my Scratch cards which are a self learning course offered for free (though a monetary contribution is more than welcome). You can contact me here: amitai.gtATgmail.com

thanks, Karen ! please let me know since it'll be invaluable for me to attend one of your workshops, especially if during summer

Hi Karen, I attended my first Scratch meetup in February and cannot wait until the March one. Please let me know if the Computing workshop will be offered again. I would be very interested. Rosemary

Hi Rosemary, It was great to have you at the February meetup. We're just working out the details of the Creative Computing workshop -- we'll announce everything on ScratchEd. See you in March! K

.... And i hope it is open also to non-US teachers, isn't it ? Thanks

The Logo Summer Institute in New York City, August 1-5, will incldue Scratch.
