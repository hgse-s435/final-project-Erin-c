Recap Networking: What do you want to do today?- As participants arrived, they were asked to share their name and place on the networking wall, giving everyone a sense of who was present at the meetup. Introductions -Gathered in a circle of chairs, Michelle asked each person to share their name, three words/phrases to describe him or herself, and one goal for the meetup. Breakout Sessions -After a quick round of think-pair-share to brainstorm breakout session ideas on large sticky notes, Derek and Laura helped arrange the post-its to organize an agenda for the meetup based on participants' interests. It was clear that everyone was interested in trying out Scratch 2.0, so the first 30-minute breakout led by Karen consisted of an exploratory hands-on session with Scratch. Next,concurrent discussions for using Scratch with the arts, STEM subjects, and in early educational settings took place in small breakout groups. Eat Dessert First! - To celebrate the recent release of Scratch 2.0 and the final Scratch educator meetup of the academic year, educators continued discussions and networking over custom Chipotle and chipsorders, followed by chocolate mousse cake from Flour.
