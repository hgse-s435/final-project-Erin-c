Greetings My name is Orad Weisberg and I am a third year student for interactive communication at the Inter disciplinary center (IDC) Herzliya, Israel. This questionnaire is part of my final seminar for "On-line communities" course. My research is about the ScratchED community and it will be very helpful if you could take five minutes and fill this forms. The forms are completely anonymous. Many members in this community are engaging in research all day long. How about for once, you put yourself under the looking glass? press here to take part and fill a form Many thanks, Orad.

Hi Orad, Could you please provide some more information about this survey? Why are you conducting it about ScratchEd? What are you hoping to understand? What's going to happen with the information you collect?

Hi Karen In the beginning of the year we were asked to choose an online community that we find interesting. The ScratchED community includes many different people, with shared passion for education and Scratch. This is a great community and this is why I am conducting it about ScratchED. As for what I am hoping to understand, its a bit early to tell :) Since this research is about the ScratchED community members, I dont want to influence on the results. The information I will collect is for my research and for that only. If there will be some interesting result I will gladly share it here once the research will be over. If there are any more questions, please feel free to ask. Orad

So far 53 viewers and only 1 filled a questioner :-/ Since this research is only on the ScratchED community you guys are my only hope. All im asking is for you to help me and take part in the research. If you have any question please feel free to ask
