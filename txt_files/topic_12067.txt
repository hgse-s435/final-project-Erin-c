Could someone please tell me how to do the following things.... 1) Set a timer to limit the time someone has to respond? I had a bash at this but it isn't working correctly and am not sure where I have gone wrong. 2) Is it possible to code a quiz so that the user can click on the correct response as opposed to using the keyboard? Thanks in advance! Jessica
