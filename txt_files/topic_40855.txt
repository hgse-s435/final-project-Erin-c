Hey everyone, I found a few upcoming Scratch-centered events for kids across Canada that are coming up, and I thought I'd share the details here in case anybody is interested. I have taught at Kids Learning Code & Girls Learning Code in the past, and they are really great organizations. If you're in the area for any of these events, you should definitely check them out! - Katie MacDonald, ScratchEd Intern Kids Learning Code: MaKey MaKey and Scratch, Game and Controller Design For: 6-8 year old kids & their parents Where: Toronto, ON When: March 6, 2016 from 1-4 PM Find more details & register here:http://ladieslearningcode.com/events/kids-learning-code-makey-makey-and-scratch-game-and-controller-design-for-6-8-year-old-kids-and-their-parents-2/ Kids Learning Code: Game Design with Scratch For:8-13 year olds Where:London, ON When:April 2, 2016 from 10 AM - 4 PM Find more details & register here:http://ladieslearningcode.com/events/kids-learning-code-game-design-with-scratch-kids-ages-8-13/ Girls Learning Code: Game Design with Scratch For:8-13 year old girls Where:Barrie, ON (Georgian College) When:April 23, 2016 from 10 AM - 4 PM Find more details & register here:http://ladieslearningcode.com/events/girls-learning-code-game-design-with-scratch-girls-ages-8-13/ Girls Learning Code: Game Design with Scratch For:8-13 year old girls Where:Vancouver, BC When:June 18, 2016 from 10 AM - 4 PM Find more details & register here:http://ladieslearningcode.com/events/girls-learning-code-game-design-with-scratch-girls-ages-8-13-3/
