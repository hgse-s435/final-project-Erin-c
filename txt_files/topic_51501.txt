As a teacher new to Scratch (and coding) - what suggestions do people have as great starter activities for my class? Thanks in advance.

I introduced Scratch in the Computer Lab at school 4 years ago and the one think I find the kids, especially the younger students struggle with is X,Y coordinates. I have several projects I could share with you that I have done with my students. I teach Kindergarten through grade 8 so I have a decent range of activities what we've created in class and after school with Scratch Club. Welcome to Scratch! My Scratch account is: mstone326
