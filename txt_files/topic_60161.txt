Hi, My students (middle school through high school) are enjoying using Scratch! I am now giving them homework assignments to code a specific program. My understanding is that I cannot see each students project unless they share it, but then everyone can see the project code including their fellow students. How can I assign my students the same project on Scratch where they must work independently? Thanks, JS
