I'd like to create a breakout edu around the theme of scratch. Breakout EDU is the idea that you are given a number of boxes that are all locked with different kinds of locks (key, combination, 4 letter words, number sequences, etc) and you have clues that you use with others to figure out how to get inside the boxes. (http://www.breakoutedu.com/). It's based on the new 'break out of a room' challenges popping up all over the place; but of course we cannot lock kids in a room so the idea is flipped. Any teachers interested in collaborating? I want to - Think of a storyline/theme involving the Scratch Cat - Animate the scratch cat to introduce the theme/story/clues - design multi-step clues, puzzles and riddles - make use of code blocks that they may be more than novice (clones, string or list operations?) - aim at elementary (grade 4?) level of difficulty Thoughts? /VicTwenty
