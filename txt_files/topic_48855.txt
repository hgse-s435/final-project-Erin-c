Hi, I just wonder if any of you have validated Scratch Rubric. Please advise..thanks as i need to use it for my phd research. Thanks.....

Hi Sylvia, Some of these ScratchEd rubric resources might be useful:?http://scratched.gse.harvard.edu/search/node/rubric%20type%3Aresource And this rubric for assessing evolving fluency with computational practices, from our Computational Thinking site, might be of interest. I'm curious to learn more about what you mean mean by "validated"? By whom and for what purposes? Thanks, Willa
