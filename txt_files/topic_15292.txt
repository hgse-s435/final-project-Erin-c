Hello, my name is Patricio and I work in the primary Florence Nightingale, in Chile. This week we were experimenting with arduino and RGB LED. We use as a programming tool Scratch for Arduino, S4A. This assembly is very simple, we use only 3 resistors and an LED. To give an artistic touch, put a origamis flower on the LED. Video(Low res)

Thanks so much for posting this, Patricio!
