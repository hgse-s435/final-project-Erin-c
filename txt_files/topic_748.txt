Some feedback on following discussion threads. 1. I am having trouble following the sequence of discussion comments. Any chance of having dates posted with each message? 2. When the e-mail comes through with updates about new posts, there seem to be a lot of extra lines and repeated text--not as easy to sort out what goes with what, and thus what is interesting to follow up on , as the regular Scratch forum e-mail. All the editing tools are very helpful! Thanks, Karen R.

Thanks for the feedback. Re: Dates on comments - Currently each discussion comment has a month/day/year stamp. Do you also want time? Or you're looking for a different representation? Re: Email updates - The notification emails are a total mess! I'm currently working on an update, so that the notifications will be hopefully easier to read and more useful.

Ah, I get it. Somehow what I ws following made dates seem more like sign-up than message dates. Times not needed. Thanks, Karen
