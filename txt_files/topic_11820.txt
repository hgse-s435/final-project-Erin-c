Scratch@MIT is one of my favorite events -- it's a biennial conference that brings a wide variety of people working with Scratch together at MIT. It's a great opportunity to share your experiences (in the classroom, in informal settings, in research) with others. Submit a proposal before the deadline next week on Wednesday, February 15.
