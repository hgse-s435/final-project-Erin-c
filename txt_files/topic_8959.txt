Hi guys, I work for SparkFun Electronics. I recently posted an Arduino teaching tool I have been working on in my free time here: http://scratch.mit.edu/galleries/view/110387 It's a little complicated if you don't have experience with Arduino or Scratch or a similar product, but read the project notes for some quick instructions if you are interested. It is a ruff draft and I posted it in the hopes that other educators would understand the idea and download for further development. Feel free to use it however you like and please post any improvements to the gallery. Dedicated to educating- Linz
