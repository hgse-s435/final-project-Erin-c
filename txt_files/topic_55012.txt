Hello. Are any educators from CSTA-NYC attending. Would love to plan some get-togethers to share ideas and enjoy this experience. Email me if you are interested - mrsmartinusa@gmail.com ~Linda

Hi Linda! Thanks for posting! As a heads up, you may also want to reach out to the Teaching with Scratch Facebook Group, as we are slowly transiitioning our discussion board over to that group! There are a ton of educators on there talking about all things Scratch :). Best, Alexa
