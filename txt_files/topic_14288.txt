Hi Scratchers I am trying to contact some members of the community by mail but cant find the information in the page. Any ideas?

Hi Liliana, To contact other ScratchEd members, you can leave a comment on their profile page. Click on the person's name to go to their profile page, and then click on the link at the bottom that says "Add a Comment". We don't add the person's personal email for privacy reasons, but the person will be notified that a comment has been left on their profile page. Please let me know if you have any other questions. Sincerely, Michelle on behalf of the ScratchEd Team
