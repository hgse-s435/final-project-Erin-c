We need a lot more Scratch Workshops on the west coast. I live in Los Angeles and would like to learn to use scratch with fellow scratchers. Anyone in LA running workshops? Thanks, rosie

Hi Rosie, You might be interested in checking out LA Makerspace, whichrecently opened in Los Angeles. They host Scratch workshops and are planning to organize a regular Scratch meetup group soon. Also, the ScratchEd Team is currently developing new online Scratch professional development offerings for educators -- so stay tuned! And if you find out about other LA-based Scratch workshops, please don't forget to share them on ScratchEd! (I'm also originally from the west coast, so I'd personally love to hear about Scratch events taking place there.) Thanks, M

Michelle, I've heard of LA Makerspace. I will definitely check that out. I run a non-profit for inner-city kids and would like kids to learn Scratch and I need to learn it as well. I would like to take advantage ofworkshops and conferences.Thank you Michelle for your help! rosie

Michelle, Thank you for sharing about LA Makerspace. I will check them out. I would like to take advantage of Scratch Workshops and conferences. I want to get better at using Scratch in order to introduce and teach it to inner-city kids. Thank you, Rosie
