Hope you don't mind the new programs we're doing. Just tasked my kids to come up with presentations or games that support the 2014 RED RIBBON THEME: LOVE YOURSELF. BE DRUG FREE. Our school normally does Red Ribbon Week contests of essays or posters, so thought I'd add programming to the mix for my middle school intro to programming course. They can 'make a game, activity, or website about staying drug/alcohol free and why it shows that you love yourself.'
