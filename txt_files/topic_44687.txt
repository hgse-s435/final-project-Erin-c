The new school year is underway, and ScratchEd meetups are kicking into gear as well! What are ScratchEd meetups? Participatory professional learning experiences for teachers who want to learn more about teaching with Scratch. They include time for networking and scheduling, exploring and learning, and sharing and reflecting. Pictures from the Boston ScratchEd Meetup, hosted at the Harvard EdPortal this past weekend. Some cities, including New York, Boston, and Lexington, Kentucky, have hosted meetups already this month, and others have upcoming events on the schedule. Scratch educator meetups are expanding overseas as well, with Moscow holding its first event over the summer http://scratched.gse.harvard.edu/stories/moscow-school-1329-hosts-first-scratched-meetup and Amsterdam preparing to host its second event this week.

Hi ScratchEd Team, This is YH from Scratch-TW group. We are a voluntary group in Taiwan focusing on tranlating Scratch teaching/learning materials into Traditional Chinese. We curate many translated materials on Scratch-TW (http://scratch-tw.strikingly.com) for public access. We are interested in translating Scratch Educator Meetup Guide into TC. In Taiwan, many teachers are using Scratch to organize computational courses. We believe it will be a great help for us to use the Meetup Guide to facilitae both fun and structured meetings in Taiwan. Is it possible for us to download the editable version of Meetup Guide? Please let us know what we can do to join this worldwidemovement. Thank you.

Hi Yu-Hsien, That's wonderful! Please feel free to use the text from the PDF. I can also email you the InDesign file, if that's useful. Thanks, Willa

Hi Willa, That's great! Please email us the InDesign file viascratch.tw.contact@gmail.com. Thank you so much We will let you know when we finish the translation and send ScratchED team the CHT file. Thanks, YH.

Sounds good! I'll send it your way. We're very excited about the translation. Thanks! Willa
