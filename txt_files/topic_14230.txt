Hello, Sorry, mi natal language is spanish and my english is very basic, so try to understand me please. I'm Colombian, 16. I'm cursing the last year in my school and I have to present a project as a requirement for graduation (like a thesis). I decided to work about Scratch and how Scratch can help the teachers in their classrooms, if you want to view my pre-project, write me and i'll show you. I need help to how can I give training for the teachers to learn how to use Scratch. I'm open to suggestions and tips Thanks in advance Juan Pablo Llanos

My coordinator told me that the project will only serve to natural sciences, as these are easier to illustrate. I do not know how I could use Scratch for math or other subjects. Thanks and blessings

Hello if you would like to send me more details of your project I will see if I can assist you in any way. I am a research student and have been using Scratch for 3 years to teach children about programming. Best wishes Amanda ( email - amanda.wilson@uws.ac.uk )

Oh thanks, I will try to translate my pre-project and send you.
