I've put together a Prezi that features some Scratch scripts with explanations / teaching notes. It includes some stuff about project euler. Here's a link to the prezi: If you are not a prezi user, you can download the presentation here. It has averages, factorial, fibonacci, square roots, prime numbers, newton's method for quadratic equations and the arctan way of calculating Pi.

Hi Mark, Great presentation, and lots of great ideas! This would be a great resource for Math educators. Would you consider posting this as a ScratchEd resourceas well? Thanks, Michelle, on behalf of the ScratchEd Team

Hi Michelle, Many thanks for noticing this. I would be happy to share it on ScratchEd.
