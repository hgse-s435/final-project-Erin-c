On a couple of student projects we are getting the message " Failed: serialization: buffer too small for compressed data" when attempting to upload to the Scratch website Any idea how to work around this issue or why this is happening? Thanks! Jennifer

Hi Jennifer, I've never seen this message before myself, but I did some digging in the Scratch forums and found that unchecking the"Compress sounds and images" box that appears in the Share screen worked for some people with a similar issue. I suggest trying it and let me know how it goes. I'll also continue to investigate. M

It worked!!! Many thanks!

Awesome! I'm glad it worked out.
