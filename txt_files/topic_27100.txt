Mother's Day Project - After watching a video presentation by Mitch Resnick called "Let's Teach Kids to Code" I was inspired to make the following interactive Mother's Day card animation project. In his presentation, Resnick talks about creating interactive Mother's Day cards and a number of other interesting topics. Creating interactive Mother's Day cards might be a fun project for students to try out. A couple examples are shown in the Resnick video.

What a great Mother's Day project! I love the interactive buttons and the addition of the lyrics. Thanks for sharing!
