I am the Young Adult Librarian at the Peabody Institute Library in Peabody, Mass. We received a grant to do some technology programming with teens at the library. I am looking for an instructor to teach a class on video game design using Scratch. If you are or know someone willing to do a class of this nature (we have a stipend to offer), please contact me at rauseo@noblenet.org. Thanks!
