Hello, Are there any resources out there that correlate Scratch activities with NCTM or state mathematics standards? I am trying to drum up interest in a Scratch workshop, and that information would be useful. Thanks for any info, Michael

Maybe this article might be of interest?Itching to Engage Pre-Service Teachers and Students in Activities That Will Help Them to Learn Math? _ Try Scratch!

Thanks, Karen, I will look into it. Michael

I am using part of our state, (NM), Math standards as a part of my Scratch Moodle unit.
