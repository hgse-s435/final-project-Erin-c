How do we teach advanced scratch? This question started at SIGCSE 2011, Workshop 1, led by Ursula Wolz, John Maloney and Chris Dunne

How was the workshop? Are there any resources that you presented that could be shared here on ScratchEd? Thanks! K

Will do later this week, we have some videos in particular that we would like to share for sure. I need to understand how to do that....
