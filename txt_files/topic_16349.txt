Hi folks, i would like to know if it's possible to add custom blocks coded via Squeak (Smalltalk) to Scratch 1.4 or the coming 2.0. I'm a teacher for EDP and informatics and want to start learning programming with my pupils with scratch and an remote controlled model car (i-racer). Therefore i would like to extend an scratch project with blocks similiar to the motor-blocks for LEGO WeDo. Or is there another way to send some custom bytes via Bluetooth from an Scratch-Programm to my I-Racer? What I found so far: Snap! (BYOB) - but this seems not to provide the necessary flexibility to code the blocks with Smalltalk, it rather provides a mechanism of organizing the existing blocks. Panther - the CYOB function documentation looks like it's that what i'm looking for, but Panther seems quite quiet!? and the download page http://www.pantheronline.net63.net/download/ showed me an "403 Forbidden" message. Is this project stile maintained and where can i get it? Scratch 2.0 functions: looks more like BYOB - i could not find a possibility to add Smalltalk-Code to my custom blocks at the beta web site! Anything good of these, for my purpose? THX a lot in advance for your help! Regards Gnter

... and i could notpost this question in Firefox:"Body is required!"IE didn't had this problem.

They did something for Microsoft Kinect, so an API or something must exist... I am not sure who you need to contact to get this info, but Iwill ask around.... Al
