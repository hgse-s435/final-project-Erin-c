Scratch is now part of the family at Computer Science Student Network (CS2N)! The CS2N is a joint project between Carnegie Mellon University, University of Pittsburgh, and Carnegie Mellon's Robotics Academy. The project has the goal to inspire more students to study Computer Science, Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (CS-STEM) and does so by offering free training, activities, and competitions to students on topics of robotics, animation, and game development.
