If I create a classroom and have all students submit their projects in the studio, is there a way that all students can have access to each other's projects (to use as review for an exam, for example).

Hi Aliya! If the students have shared their projects, they should be able to access each other's projects through the studio. If students are having trouble seeing other students' projects, it may be that they have not shared the project correctly. I hope this is helpful! Best, Alexa
