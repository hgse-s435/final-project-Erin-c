Recap After a speed dating networking activity, the group collectively developed the agenda for the day. We decided on two breakout sessions to discuss assessment and to share project ideas. Colin led the assessment group. First, he shared a work-in-progress evaluation plan which started a discussion around student's sharing projects as an assessment tool. Then Aaron and Colin role-played a student describing a project to a teacher with the rest of the group members sharing observations and ideas. Ricarose and Dan led another group across the room to share Scratch projects and lesson plan ideas. Over lunch, each of the breakout groups shared their experiences with the rest of the participants, followed by a lightning round Show & Tell. View photos from the event on the ScratchEd Flickr page.
