The instructional specialist and I just finished a curriculum intergrated project "Where in the World" with Pixie, Google docs and Scratch with 2 fifth grade classes. I would love to hear from educators on if they ever integrated Scratch with the arts (Pixie) and a content area.  We want to make this project more exciting in years to come. Any comments or suggestions would be welcomed as this was our first attempt using Scratch.
