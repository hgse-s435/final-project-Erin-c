Posted for a Media Lab colleague... ----- I have a contact in Cambridge, MA, and they are looking for a mentor to help with a team of students preparing for the First Lego League 2011. The First Lego League is a competition for elementary and middle school students on building Lego robots. The team will most likely form in the spring 2011 and they want help from a creative fun person who is interested in suggesting new ideas and guide them through the process. Preferably they want the mentor to visit them once every 2-3 weeks, more often if possible. They are willing to provide small compensation for the time. Please contact taemie AT media.mit.edu if you are interested.
