http://www.gethopscotch.com I like to see the ideas of Scratch spread around. However, I wondered how this relates to Scratch being banned from the iPad and iPhone some years ago. (Alan Kay spoke out about it, etc.) Is Scratch still banned for being an interpretive language? If so, where does Hopscotch fit in?
