Unfortunately, the July 2012 ScratchEd Webinar: Scratch@MIT Previewhas been cancelled. We realized that no matter how much we wanted to, hosting a webinar during theScratch@MIT conferencejust wasn't going to work. Weapologize for any inconvenience. Still need your ScratchEd Webinar Wednesday fix? You can check out past webinar recordingson ScratchEd. We'd especially recommend last month's webinar:Scratch Educator Show & Tellwhich featured three Boston-area Scratch educators sharing their classroom experiences. We hope to see you at the next ScratchEd webinar:Back to School with Scratchon Wednesday, August 29. Sign up to receive a reminder email. Sincerely, The ScratchEd Team
