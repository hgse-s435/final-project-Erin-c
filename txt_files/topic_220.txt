We're really excited to be hosting the Creative Computing workshop from July 16 to July 18 at MIT Media Lab. At the workshop,we'll explore new educational technologies and instructional strategies to engage students in creative design activities -- and, in the process, help students develop as computational thinkers and computational creators.

Began my Computer Science class with Scratch this September. Students are really excited to begin programming in such a visual way! Having a blast!

Ah, that's great! I can't wait to hear all about how you introduce it to them...
