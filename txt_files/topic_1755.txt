I am working on a Scratch unit for Moodle and Blackboard. Who do I contact for permission to use the Scratch logo as part of the course unit? This unit will be available free to all educators. Carl

You're welcome to use the Scratch logo. Check outhttp://info.scratch.mit.edu/Support/FAQ/Scratch_Software_FAQ#License-- particularly the question "Can I include a description of Scratch and the Scratch logo in brochures or other materials?" You can get a copy of the logo there or from the Scratch Day site. Hope that helps, K
