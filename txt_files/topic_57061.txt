Hello, I am wondering if a video was taken during the keynote speaker sessions at the recent Scratch Conference. If so, can someone send me a link to view them? Thanks, Kelly

Hi Kelly! Here is what the Scratch Team says about the videos of keynotes and other content from the conference: For information and updates about future conferences and to connect with others in the Scratch community, join theScratch@MIT Conference Facebook Group.
