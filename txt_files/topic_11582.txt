The Creative Computing reunion is on Saturday. What do you want to learn?

I really want to learn more about the "join" block. It seems like it's an important one if you're trying to expand into more advanced features. Looking forward to seeing everyone tomorrow!

Great suggestion. Looking forward to talking more tomorrow. M

I would like to learn more about the pen tool and develop project ideas utilizing this feature.

Looking forward to hearing and sharing assessment ideas. Also, ideas on how to keep the students more focused; how to get them to better understand the computational concepts behind what they are doing.

Ooh, me too!
