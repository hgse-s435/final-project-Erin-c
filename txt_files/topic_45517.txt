Hi All, I recently created a class in my Scratch teacher account and uploaded 97 student user names and passwords via CSV files. I then tested several student accounts, and in each case Scratch says the password is incorrect. The passwords in the uploaded CSV files each had seven characters - a combination of letters and numbers, and the minimum number is six, so I don't think that is the problem. If I enter a student's account and change the password manually, the account will log in.I hope there is a more efficient workaround to resolve this issue. It is not practical to enter 97 accounts and change each password manually. This is especially daunting in that I have another class to create that will have 120 students. I'd appreciate any suggestions and insights the ScratchEd community might have. Thanks! Tim

Hi Tim. Might you please send a message to help@scratch.mit.edu so we can look into what is going on? Since we will need to ask you account information, it is best not to do so publicly. Thank you!

Hi Yasushi. Will you also send a message to help@scratch.mit.edu about the situation? Thanks!
