This year, a team of Scratch educators (Ingrid Gustafson, Janet Dee, and Rosemary Slattery) are organizing and hosting the monthly meetups, with financial support from the ScratchEd Team at HGSE. The first meetup of the school year is next Saturday, September 27 from 10am to 1pm, at the Kennedy-Longfellow School in Cambridge, courtesy of the Cambridge Public Schools. As always, the meetups are free, and include lunch and parking. Register now at http://scratched-cambridge.eventbrite.com and help spread the word -- we look forward to seeing you at the meetup! If you have any questions, you can contact the meetup organizers at scratched.cambridge@gmail.com or the ScratchEd Team at scratched@gse.harvard.edu
