We've received numerous requests for extra time to work on proposals for this summer's Scratch conference, so we've just extended the proposal deadline by two weeks. Proposals are now due on February 15. If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to let me know! Thanks, K http://events.scratch.mit.edu/conference/2010
