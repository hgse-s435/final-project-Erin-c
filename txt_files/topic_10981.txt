Hi. How long does it take before a new Scratch gallery appears in Scratch website searches? Peter R ----------

Hi Peter, The gallery should appear in searches after you've added the first project to the gallery. Let me know if you have any further questions. M

Hi. I have two projects uploaded. I can't seem to find it in search.The name of the gallery is: Foote School PD Scratchers thanks.

Could you please post a link to the gallery? Thanks!
