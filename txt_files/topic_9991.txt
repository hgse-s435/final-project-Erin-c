Thanks to everyone who was able to join us on Saturday for our last Scratch educator meetup of the school year, despite the Bruins parade! Here are some notes, reflections, and next steps... 1. Creating After some initial networking and getting-to-know-you, we got started with some hands-on experiences with Scratch -- with a focus on the physical world through WeDo and PicoBoard.Here are some of the resources we used to get started WeDo WeDo kits are available for purchase online from LEGO education.

Discussing After some building time, we gathered for lunch and discussion. People talked about what they had been working on and the discussions they had. People shared what they did in the "creating" portion of the meetup. Algot shared his car project -- and later posted a blog entry and video about it! http://mosssig.wordpress.com/2011/06/19/scratched-meetup/ andhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6LB8TDDyTc Now that the meetups are going on hiatus, I talked a bit about the ScratchEd team's plans for the summer. I also talked about a workshop I hosted in Wisconsin earlier that week. If you have any suggestions for the page I put together for that workshop (in particular, the six strategies for getting started), please share!http://web.media.mit.edu/~kbrennan/gls/ Vicki Gold gave an update about the advocacy work that she and Patrice Gans are undertaking. 3.
