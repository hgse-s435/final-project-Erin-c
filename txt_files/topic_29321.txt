My name is Katy and I work at Einstein's Workshop.Over the past two years we've been getting children into STEM/STEAM through a variety of ways. We're huge fans of Scratch, and are running a number of Scratch programming classes this fall. We're currently working on an educational software tool called BlocksCAD, a drag-and-drop 3D CAD and modeling tool designed for elementary schoolers, partly inspired by the success we've seen kids have with Scratch. We've already had great success teaching math and programming skills to elementary students in grades 3 and above, while motivating them with the ability to design 3D printable objects. We want to make it freely available so kids will be able to use it in the classroom or at home. To that end, we recently launched a Kickstarter campaign to fund open sourcing BlocksCAD and further development. Here is a link to our page: http://www.einsteinsworkshop.com/blockscad We'd love to get feedback from the Scratch community, and are looking for ways to help spread the word. Thanks!
