Hello, i run a little scratch studio and it would be great to find out some plan to teach scratch step by step.

Hi Artem! Are you familiar with the Creative Computing Guide at all? It is one of the resources we've created, which leads you through various levels of scratch-project development, from the very basics (what is scratch!) to de-bugging and game design! You can find it here:http://scratched.gse.harvard.edu/guide/ Let us know if this is helpful! Best, Alexa from the ScratchEd team

Thank you Alexa, i`ve seen it, i`ve read russian version and it is cool. May i please ask you - what age do you think is good for this guidance? Do you have advanced guides to implement variables, functions and more?
