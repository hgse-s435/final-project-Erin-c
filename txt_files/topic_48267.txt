I have set up Studios for each of my classes to share their class projects for me so I can see them. I have 3 or 4 students (out of 75) that can't see the studio I set up. Can anyone help me with this isssue. We all signed up to Scratch using the class link I got from Scratch. All the other students can post to the studios I set up. Thanks for any suggestions on how to fix this issue with them!! :) Gina

Hi Gina, My name is Christan Balch, I work on the MIT Scratch Team. I'm sorry to hear you've been experiencing some trouble with class studios. Might you please send a message to help@scratch.mit.edu and include a link to the studio and the names of the student accounts having trouble? We would be happy to look into what the problem might be. Thanks! Christan
