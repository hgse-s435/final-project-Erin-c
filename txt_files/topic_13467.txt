I realize that the deadline for dorm rooms is past but I had a change in some of my plans and am just checking to see if anyone knows any possible cancellations or people looking for a room mate for Thursday/Friday night. Thanks for any advice or information. Tracy Rudzitis (NYC)

Hi Tracy, It might be worth contacting the MIT on-campus housing office, even though the deadline has passed... See you soon!

that's okay, got a reservation at a place not too far away and within my budget! Can't wait for Thursday!!! see you all then!

OK, great -- glad to hear that you'll have a place to stay!
