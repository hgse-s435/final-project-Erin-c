Mark Prensky have published a new book : "Teaching Digital Natives, Partnering for Real Learning". I am very surprised he tell nothing about Scratch. However, I think Scratch enable to pursue his "new paradigm" all over the world. This website is here to proove it. That's why I have titled : Paradox for a paradigm :-) To know more about this book To preview this book

Another book of interest is Program or be Programmed Ten Commands for a Digital Age Douglas Rushkoff www.orbooks.com/our-books/program/ "In this spirited, accessible poetics of new media, Rushkoff picks up where Marshall McLuhan left off, helping readers come to recognize programming as the new literacy of the digital age__and as a template through which to see beyond social conventions and power structures that have vexed us for centuries." I have not read it yet, but I've just order it. I became interested because he is claiming programming to be the new literacy. I love it! Vicki

I have read the book, and it is a MUSTREAD! Vicki Gold
