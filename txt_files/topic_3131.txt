Iam happy to facilitate a space on Second Life for users to share their experiences of teaching with Scratch. You can now use Scratch in Second Life and Open Sim. This group will be to share ideas and expereinces amongst adults who have an interest in this area. The interest group will meet twice a term to discuss what they are doing in their class or institution or company. You will need to have : an Avatar in Second Life, a quicktime movie player, a soundcard + headphones the new Second Life Viewer software a broadband connection at home Please do get back to me (offlist please) - leoncych [at] g mail [dot] com - if you are interested and I will set up an initial meeting after Easter in Second Life. NBthis is for users to meet and talk virtually and to share ideas and experience. Cheers, Leon Cych (learn4life)

Very cool -- I hope you'll consider sharing the group's experiences with the ScratchEd community! K

Hi Karen, Yes, certainly will - part of our brief is to get teachers and parents together to explore the program under the context of CPDcontinual professional development for teachers in the UK- we aim to bring people into Second Life who have never been in an immersive world before. We are also trying to bring people from the Arduino community in there and maybe people who know a bit about Pachube. I personally, am very interested in cross-reality environments but we need to walk before we can run. We will be putting up a Doodle in the next couple of weeks to garner interest - we already have a space marked out. Iguess we are lucky in that the island this year has been underwritten by Vital.ac.uk - an offshoot of the Open University - they are sponsoring our activities for the year so it should be interesting. I will be posting all videos, interactions, machinima and text records through the http://www.vital.ac.uk site and include specific links here. Leon
