Do you have 5 minutes? Be counted -- and participate in the 2012 Scratch Educator Census. Members of the MIT Scratch Team are trying to better understand where and how Scratch is being used. Whether you've never used Scratch or have a lot of Scratch experience, we hope that you'll take a few minutes to answer some (no more than 20) short demographic questions. In appreciation of your time, we're hosting a raffle. We've got 10 Scratch starter kits, 5 Scratch boards, and 1 Scratch@MIT conference registration to raffle. If you'd like to be entered into the raffle, just respond by Friday, June 22 and submit your email address at the end of the survey. We will be announcing the winners of the raffle at the end of June. If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to contact me at kbrennan AT media.mit.edu
