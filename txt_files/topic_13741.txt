Hi, I am a technology teacher (K-8), and am excited to be using Scratch. This will be a beginning adventure for my students. I am a little overwhelmed by the website, as I don't know where I can find beginning steps, intermediate steps, etc. I have been exploring but I need more of a step by step process, at least to get them started and engaged. Where do I begin? Thanks, Brendaward

Dear Brenda, Have you seen the Scratch curriculum guide draft? That might be one place to start. There are many great resources available on ScratchEd in the Resources area, including other curricular sequences. Hope that helps!
