Hello Teachers, I am working with Tufts University in conjunction with the MIT media lab to create a new Scratch Jr. aimed for children from preschool - second grade. As part of the external evaluation team, I am interested in collecting some feedback and experiences from teachers who have used Scratch in the past with young children. At this phase in the research, I am hoping to speak to teachers who have used Scratch in a preschool - second grade classroom to find out what worked well with the program and what might need to be changed to create a more successful program for younger children. As a teacher myself, I understand how precious your time is. The ideal interview would be in the form of a phone interview which would last for about 20 minutes. If you are unable to speak on the phone, I would be more than happy to email you the questions for you to answer at your convenience. Interviews will typically be conducted in the afternoons and evenings, but ?I would be more than happy to fit with your schedule. ?I hope to complete these interviews by January 17, 2012. Please let me know if you are willing to participate in this interview. ? Thank you for your consideration, Katherine Schellie, M.A. ? Educational Specialist ? Ponte & Chau Consulting ?
