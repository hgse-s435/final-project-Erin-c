The school year is starting up again. How will you be working with Scratch?

I'm looking forward for my students (1st .through 6th grade) to show up. Now that they and I are more familiar with Scratch after working with it for two years , I want to introduce new concepts that I know they will understand and apply in no time. I've installed the new Scratch 1.4 during the summer, so they will be excited to see the new feautures. Good luck to everyone and may you accomplish all your goals for the school year2009-2010.

Hello all Scratch users. I just learned Scratch (briefly) at NECC09, and I need to teach it to my students. They are in high school, but this will be there first exposure to programming of any type, so Ithink it'll be fun. Does anyone have a curriculum that I could follow to help the students learn it step by step, and not just "make it work", but learn some of the why's and terminology? Or suggestions for which projects Ishould teach/have them learn first, second, etc. All suggestions are welcome! THANKS!

Hi Laurie, I replied to this on the new thread... Thanks, Karen

It is September - why not try our Scratch lesson plan this term ?
