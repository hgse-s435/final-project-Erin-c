Dear all I want to announce our first courses focused on Scracth and Robotics for Italian Teachers and Youth Workers. We are preparing the course and we are very excited ;-) If you have some suggestions we are happy to share with you our ideas and your suggestion! We want to introduce Scratch and some "robotics" device: Lego Wedo 1 and 2 Makey Makey Arduino (with a kit created by Scuola di Robotica (my society) called BYOR Jr - Build your own robot) I followed your guidelines on Scratch MeetUp to manage the course. But If you have some suggestion I will be very happy to discover new things and methodologies. More information on www.scuoladirobotica.it Keep in touch Emanuele Micheli Scuola di Robotica (School of Robotics)
