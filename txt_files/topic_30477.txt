Is there someway to export the student's HoC activities as an MP4 or WAV or something so we can share them with their parents downrange? We make a giant holiday movie of students' creations each year to send to family members downrange. It would be fun if we could include their programs, too

Hi Janet You could record the screen, and then (or at the same time) ad a speakervoice. I thinkhttp://screencast-o-matic.comhas a free nice solution (tried only with PC). You can save the recording as a mp4. /Anders

Thanks! Tried that with no success but then someone showed me how to use our SMART Notebook Tools to record. Hurray.
