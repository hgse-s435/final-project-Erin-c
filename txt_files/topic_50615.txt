Hello all! We are finalizing our preparations for Growing Scratch Communities at ISTE next week. Do you have a photo from a meetup that you would allow us to share in our poster presentation? We want to share meet ups from all over the world! Please email photos to Kelly.fischer@fayette.kyschools.us along with your location. Thank you!

Hi Kelly! We're so excited that you're sharing your meetups experience at ISTE! Our ScratchEd Flickr account has loads of meetups photosfrom Boston and beyond. Here's a link to all the albums: https://www.flickr.com/photos/scratchedteam/albums Hope that helps! And see you at ISTE! Willa, on behalf of the ScratchEd Team
