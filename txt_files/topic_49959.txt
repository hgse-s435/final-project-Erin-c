I am new to scratch. I am unclear of how to assign specific projects for students to work on. I am a teacher and have a teacher account

Hi David, Welcome! Here are some resources that might be useful: 1. A handy FAQ about Teacher Accounts from the Scratch Team at MIT (who manage Teacher Accounts): https://scratch.mit.edu/educators/faq 2. An ongoing ScratchEd discussion about setting up student accounts:  http://scratched.gse.harvard.edu/discussions/how-do-i/scratch-accounts-classroom-use 3. The initial announcement about Teacher Accounts, from the MIT team, with some useful and ongoing comments: http://scratched.gse.harvard.edu/discussions/news-and-announcements/scratch-teacher-accounts And, in case it's useful, here's a little chart that clarifies the difference between Scratch, Scratch Teacher Accounts, and ScratchEda common source of confusion. ;) Hope that helps! Keep in touch! Willa
