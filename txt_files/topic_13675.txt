The Thursday, Friday, and Saturday keynote recordings are now available.

Hi Karen, This is great! I'd love to see the Saturday morning sharing session - is there any chance of that? Thanks!

Hi Susan, Do you mean the 11am session your students participated in? If so, unfortunately, I don't have a recording of that -- we only recorded the keynote sessions at the beginning of each day. (Recording is very expensive.)

I know these were posted a year ago, but I'm so glad I found them. Thanks for sharing the keynotes, they are very informative.

And in a few weeks time fresh keynotes will arrive form Scratch Connecting Worlds. Registration still open, keynotes will be streamed and made available afterwards.

Thanks for the heads up!
