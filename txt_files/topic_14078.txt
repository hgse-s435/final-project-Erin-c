What kind of application do you suggest that Iuse to help students (new to Scratch) to help plan their inquiry?

Hi Brenda, If you haven't already, you might be interested in checking out the Scratch curriculum guide. The guide includes handouts for planning and storyboarding Scratch projects (see Session #13 and handouts on page 68-69). Hope that helps! M
