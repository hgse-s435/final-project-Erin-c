Hello, Spent yesterday playing around with some Lego Wedo parts in Scratch. Right now Scratch can recognize / control one motor. One can hook two motors together and they will both do the same thing, but they cannot be controlled separately. I'd like to see the ability added to sense what is hooked up via usb and then have the ability to control it / them. This would extend to the sensors as well I suppose. On a non-Scratch note the Wedo tilt sensors are simply awful. At first I thought I had a dud, but the one from the second packet was just as bad. It is supposed to generate a number depending on which way the unit is tilted, but I think a random number generator would be just about as useful.  :-(
