Hello I'm wondering if anyone has any resources for evaluating student made games with SCRATCH. I'm a Maker Space teacher at a middle school and I have students that are constantly designing games in SCRATCH which is awesome! We have a project that includes students creating their own SCRATCH Arcade and we need a way to evaluate games to be entered into the arcade. Any resources will be greatly appreciated! Thanks! Andrew
