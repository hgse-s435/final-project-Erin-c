Iam using the broadcast feature to have multiple sprites interact with each other. Is there a way to turn off the broadcast after the desired result is complete. My sprites continue to recieve the broadcasts

What does the rest of your code look like? You will need to structure your code so that the broadcast block only gets executed once; you can also try using the stop script block.

Maybe this is complicating things,but If the broadcast has to be executed more than once because of other sprites, you can create a variable for a specific sprite with initial value zero, have it incremented when the boadcast is received and have the sprite "react" only if the value of the variable is one.
