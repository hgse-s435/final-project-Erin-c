I had a wonderful time at the Creative Computing Workshop andI wanted to thank everyone for making our time together a meaningful experience. I learned a lot about teaching Scratch and I look forward to sharing my new found insights with my students. I would love for us to continue to share and possibly meet in the future. I would like to discuss the possibility of having a meetup in Connecticut in the fall. We could get together on either a Saturday or a Sunday at a local public library (they have free internet and available meeting rooms). I thought that the topic of our meetup could be the planning of a group activity, centered around Scratch for Computer Science Education Week. Here is some information about last year's CSEdWeek - http://www.csedweek.org/. Thanks again for an amazing learning opportunity! Patrice Gans pgans@fraserwoods.com

This sounds like a great idea. I'm in.

Great. Let's talk some more.

Patrice, I'd love to do this. Do you have a weekend in mind?

I don't have a specific weekend in mind, but I am open to suggestions. I am pretty busy through October, but November looks open.How about if you both contact me via my e-mail address and try and work something out.
