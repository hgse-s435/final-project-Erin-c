We just did the debugging exercises yesterday and today we are starting the gaming part of the new curriculum. It was too late in the learning process. Next year, I will move this lesson earlier. I thought it would be a good review but they didn't have patience for it and because they were able to find the problem so quickly, some of the value of the debugging was lost. The one good thing that happened though, was that in two cases, people found solutions that were much more complicated than necessary and in both instances, the students were quick to show them that there was another fix that was much simpler.
