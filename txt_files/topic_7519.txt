Just want to share our new website where I will be uploading the materials used and lesson learned. I have learned a lot from the scratch community and finally managed to get this club started. As I develop the program I will post them up and love to have any feedback and advice along the way. www.parkstreetscratchclub.org I am still waiting for parent's permission to post more student projects online (we are only at week three anyway). And eventually Ithink we'll setup a private server for the projects only because the kids are too young and maybe hard to get parents buy-ins at the beginning to join the main site right away. Anyway thanks for many people that Italked with and learnt from over the last few years (since the 2008 scratch conference Ithink). P.K.

Thanks for sharing the link to your Scratch Club resources!

I'm planning on teaching Scratch to elementary school students this summer and your resources are very helpful. Thanks.
