are there any LIVE in person conferences??? I teach Scratch K-5 and would love a workshop or two (or three) to attend! Thanks!

Hi Alexis, The workshop in Denver is live and in-person, and we host live, in-person workshops at MIT regularly. K

Is there a summer workshop at MIT? My school is trying to figure out the professional development budget and is willing to send me but I can't seem to find any dates for anything other than a potential conference in Europe (which I am sure will be too $$). Thank you!
