A number of us at Ramapo Central School District in Suffern, NY are implemening the Curriculum Guide as the backbone of our new third grade Computational Thinking unit. We brought a draft of the rubric up to the Scratch meetup a few weeks ago, and garnered some excellent feedback. We've now revised it enough to share with the ScratchEd community. We intend the rubric to be used as a tool for both students and teachers to evaluate the major projects in the unit: Dance party, Storytelling, Art, Games, and a final project.You'll also notice that there are notes in the document, intended for teachers' eyes. We want to know what you think! What do you like? How would you change it for use in your own classrooms? Your feedback would be much appreciated.

Great work! Looks like a lot of thought was put into this. My class is working through the curriculum as well and will likely begin their final projects in a couple weeks. I've been thinking of using a rubric to evaluate, so I might give yours a shot and see how it goes. I'll try to give you some feedback then.

Hi Tyson, Did you have a chance to use the rubric? What did you think? Thanks!

Just found this rubic. I am so giving it a try in the 2013-14 school year. Thanks for your hard work and for sharing.
