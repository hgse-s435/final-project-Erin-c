Thanks to everyone who joined us at MIT last Saturday for the Intro Scratch Workshop for Educators! Here are some reflections and resources from Saturday's session... Attendees Courtney Collins Anesta Hicks Liddell Hobin Alan Landover Jared Perrine Simone Pyle ML UJWAL Susan Swan Summary We organized the 4-hour workshop around sessions #1 and #2 of the new Scratch curriculum guide. Each participant received a copy of the curriculum guide at the beginning of the workshop. After breakfast and introductions, Karen Brennan presented an overview of Scratch and Creative Computing, followed by the Something Surprising activity. Next, following session #2 of the curriculum guide, Michelle Chung introduced the "About Me" interactive collage activity centered around a Halloween theme. The group brainstormed project ideas about childhood memories of Halloween, and then, Michelle showed one way to get started by starting to build an example project on the large screen in front of the group. Next, everyone was given 40 minutes of uninterrupted hands-on time to explore their own "Spooky Memories" projects. We then held an impromptu Show & Tell session to check-in on everyone's progress and discuss the curriculum guide, followed by a second, 30-minute build session. The workshop ended with Karen sharing resources and strategies for next steps. Show & Tell During Show & Tell, each person shared their progress and talked about their process. We asked each participant: What are you most proud of? What was most challenging? or Is there something you're currently stuck on?
