Hi everyone, Just a quick update about Scratch@MIT conference registration... If you're hoping to attend the Scratch conference and haven't already registered, I'd recommend registering soon. At the time of this post (afternoon of Thursday, June 21), there are only 30 of 400 spots remaining. You can register online via the conference website. Of course, if you have any questions, please don't hesitate to let me know!
