I am a Computer Science teacher at Norcross High School in Georgia. How do I browse the members list to find other Georgia Scratch teachers? When I click on the Members tab, I get a map of the world. I'd like to limit that to Georgia.

Hi Jan, You can navigate the map and zoom in on Georgia, clicking on the pins as you zoom in. You can also search for member profiles that mention Georgia --http://scratched.media.mit.edu/search/node/Georgia%20type%3Aprofile Hope that helps, K
