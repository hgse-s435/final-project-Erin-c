Hi All! I am looking for feedback/information on the structure of how your school teaches/integrates CS in elementary school? Specifically the following: How many times per week is it taught? Who teaches it (classroom teacher or Specialist)? If Specialist, how many specialist for school (i.e. is it broken into grade bands)? Is Comp Sci mixed with general technology intstruction and/or Robotics? What other technology, maker, innovation support staff does your school have? Thank you!
