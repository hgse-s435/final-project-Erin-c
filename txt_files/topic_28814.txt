Somerville CoderDojo is starting up again in September. The first 4 weeks are 100% focused on Scratch http://www.meetup.com/Somerville-CoderDojo We are looking especially for volunteers to help guide the kids and who would also like to learn more themselves (we'll also be covering Python and Java over time)!
