Hello eveyrone! I'm hoping to find some Toronto-area Scratchers to help out with an event we're sponsoring at the Mozilla Foundation offices in Toronto, called "Toronto Teacher Hack Jam: Web Making in the Classroom". The event will focus on tools and techniques for integrating webmaking -- programming and digital creation -- into the classroom. Scratch is a big part of this, but unfortunately our Scratch instructors jut bailed and I'm scrambling to find someone to take up the slack. Is there anyone in the Toronto area who might be able to help out? I can definitely assist with planning the workshop materials and so on. Also, if there are any scratchers outthere who would like to just come, the event is free and open to the public -- sign up here: http://torontoteacherhackjam.eventbrite.com/ Thanks much! Matt ps, feel free to contact me directly, matt.price@utoronto.ca
