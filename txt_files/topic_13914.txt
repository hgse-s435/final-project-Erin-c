Hi all, I've just finished editing a new comic book aimed at introducing kids (ages 8+) to programming concepts, called Super Scratch Programming Adventure. It's a comic that shows kids how to create (and build on) simple, playable videogames in Scratch. Read more about the book here: nostarch.com/scratch Here's a sample chapter: nostarch.com/download/samples/Scratch_Stage4.pdf Get 40% off the book with coupon SCRATCH4KIDS, and get a free ebook edition with your order, too. I'm also very happy to send free review copies to bloggers, media, and other folks with an interest and an audience--just send a note to tyler[at]nostarch.com Cheers, Tyler
