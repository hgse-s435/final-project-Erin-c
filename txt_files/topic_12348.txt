WebMaking Instructor Community Conference Saturday, May 12, 2012 10am - 4pm MIT Media Lab Hosted by the Mozilla Foundation and Team ScratchEd This 1-day event will bring together participants to collaborate, share experiences, and help each other in our common vision of teaching the world how to code, make stuff on the web, and express themselves online. This is not your traditional conference. You can expect to be drawing things on giant sheets of paper. You can expect hundreds of colorful sticky notes decorating the wall. We will be actually making things. Realizing our vision means connecting and supporting the diverse community of like-minded folks who are passionate about teaching the world to make stuff on the web. We want to meet similar people facing similar problems, and figure out common solutions. Our vision 1.We believe in making things on the web! 2. We want to build a generation of webmakers. 3. We believe in interest-based learning. 4. We believe in less yak, more hack!
