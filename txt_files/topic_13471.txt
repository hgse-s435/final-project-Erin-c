Hello all Is there anyone staying at theBoston Marriott Cambridge?

I am... and so are my two fellow Technology Educators from the Austin Children's Museum. Send me an email and we can exchange info: eweerts (at) austinkids (dot) org Looking forward to it!

I am !! ... are you guys attending a workshop today?, we could meet in the lobby and go to the MIT Media Lab together. I feel kind of lonely, since I am here by myself, lol.

Hi Vera I don't know about Emily but I am going to the workshop. Could be great meeting in the lobby. What time do you plan to go?

Around 11:45 would be fine... the MIT Media Lab is pretty close to the Hotel.

Sorry I guess we had some communication problems... Missed your msg

Hey, you're staying right around the corner of The meadhall. Tonight from 8pm onwards some of us will gather there ...
