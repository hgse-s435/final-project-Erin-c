Hello Scratch educators/researchers, I'm happy to let you know that my article on teens who developed Scratch Wiki, Scratch Resources, and newspapers using Scratch has been published in Journal of the American Society for InformationScience and Technology. Here is a citation and a link to the abstract: Koh, K. (2013). Adolescents information-creating behavior embedded in digital media practice using Scratch. Journal of the American Society for InformationScience and Technology. 64(9), 1826-1841. doi:10.1002/asi.22878 onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/asi.22878/abstract My study with Scratchers shows that today's kids not only search and use information but also produce and share information, such as wiki articles, tutorials, newspapers, etc., in various forms. I suggest that current information literacy instructions, which tend to focus on information search skills, need to be updated to include how to create and present information effectively, ethically, and creatively. Please feel free to let me know if you have any questions or you'd like to discuss this topic more. :-) Best, Kyungwon Koh, PhD Assistant Professor School of Library and Information Studies The University of Oklahoma kkoh@ou.edu
