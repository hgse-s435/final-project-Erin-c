I posted this question in the Scratch forum but I thought I post it here as well.  I am trying to embed my student projects directly into my school website. I have used the html code provided but it depending on what computer I am on or browser they may or may not be viewable.  It is inconsistent and different on all computers I try and the results are different every time. I am concern that my students and parents can not access the file from home and for that matter in my lab. Is anyone else have the same problem? Is this a known issue with Scratch and if so is Scratch working to correct. I noticed in the Scratch forums other with similar issues but I could not find any definitive answers. Here is a link to the page on my site that I have embedded several projects. I be interested in knowing if other can see and play my projects that I have embeded.

Hi Sandy, I tried looking the link and was able to see the projects page on both of my Chrome and Safari browsers, although Safari took a bit longer to load the projects so I was looking at a white page for about 5 seconds, so that might also be the issue. Nice projects! M

Thanks Michelle for you input. I think the issue is mainly with Firefox as the browser. Safari and Chrome appear not to be an issue any longer but Firefox and IE still unpredicable. Will direct my parents and students to use Chrome or Safari if they have a Mac.
