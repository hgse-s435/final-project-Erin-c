Hello, I downloaded this on my IPad and it is really cute - I loved it! We create curriculums to teach Scratch to elementary schools and I wanted to know if there is desktop version of ScratchED Jr that I could install on computers? Don't want to really go out and buy so many tablets!! Thanks! Vrinda Joshi (tinytechsclub@gmail.com)

There isn't a version of "Jr" but you can download the full version of scratch that is similar with even more features here:https://scratch.mit.edu/scratch2download/
