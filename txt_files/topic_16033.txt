Hello i am a newbe with scratch, but familiar in programminng. I teach children with a visual impairment and want to use scratch in combination with a brailledisplay. A brailledisplay is a device connected to a laptop which shows text in the form of braille. It is a refreshable device which you can send a text string and it will show this on the display. It also has some buttons for navigation. I want to use the braille part for showing text and and the buttons for input. I am a experienced programmer and teacher which made software to teach children braille by computer (braillestudio). I am very interrested to make some challenging applications for my students with scratch. Can anybody give me please advice where to start? regards, Eric de Quartel edquartel@bartimeus.nl edequartel@gmail.com www.bartimeus.nl
