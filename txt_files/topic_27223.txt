For surviving in 21st century, one needs to think critically and creatively, embrace diversity and tolerate ambiguity, create as well as consume information. Many of these skills can be developed through the innovative use of computers in art subjects like drawing, painting, music etc. and natural language. Arts education promotes work habits that cultivate curiosity, imagination, creativity and communication skills. Students who possess these skills are better able to tolerate and tackle ambiguity, explore new realms of possibility, express their own thoughts and feelings and understand the perspective of others. Students capacity to create and express themselves through arts is one of the central qualities that make the human, as well as a basis for success in the 21st century. But the new technologies have been largely absent in art education at school level. The current education curriculum focuses on fairly latest but, difficult to understand category of programming languages. So am trying to make a research paper on how the language and arts can be integrated using MITs Scratch environment? is that possible.

how to itegrate language and arts with MIT scratch Programming?
