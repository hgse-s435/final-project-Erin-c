Hi Today a young student ,12 yrs, gave me a little hint of website called camspace. You can use a webcam to track things and use the tracking to a mousemove... Ive had a two hour scratchclass with the students. And he had of course downloaded Scratch. And today he gave me the tip about camspace. I tried it when I came home.. and yes, it did the tracking.... I tried to use a small colored paper to be tracked and made a small scratchprogram with mouse x/y and I managed to move my scratchsprite with the colored paper... So I couldnt resist to write in this forum... :) Now you can track everything, and use it in your scratchprogram. Every day has something new to be explored, Anders

Very cool! Thanks for sharing...

Agree - thank you for posting. I'll use it tomorrow in class. Will let the kids go into experimenter mode to discover the possibilities. Terry

Hello, This looks like a lot of fun. I use Macs but am going to put Win on one of them just to try it out. Another idea is using a Wii remote as the input device, http://www.wiimoteproject.com/index.php I haven't tried this yet, but it is on my to-do list.

I looked into this and am a little bit confused. It seems you can only use their built in games unless you make a controller? Did you make a controller for Scratch? Or am I missing something obvious ..

Wow! This is cool. Great project for me to work on over our Thanksgiving holiday. Thanks for the tip! Scratch's capabilities continually amaze me.
