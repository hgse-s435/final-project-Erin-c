Hi everyone! See below for a message from our friends at Code.org: We want to celebrate schools that teach CS! Code.org is currently working to gather data from every school in the country about the types of computer science activities offered. We want to celebrate the incredible efforts that Scratch educators have made to get computer science into their schools. Make sure your school gets counted by filling out the 5-minute survey for your school atcode.org/yourschool
