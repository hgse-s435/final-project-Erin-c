Hi, Does anyone if it is possible to show and hide list?It can be done for variables but I'm don't see a way it can be done with list.

No, unfortunately, it's not possible to programmatically control the visibility of lists...

Thanks for the reply Karen. I'll move to plan "B" with my students' projects. Thanks again

Not in the conventional sense but you can place a sprite over a list and hide it or remove the sprite and show it. I once used a big sprite to cover a list and make the entries look like line items in a gui.

Is this something that is on the list to be added in future releases? Thanks...Hans

Hi Hans, Yes, this will be included in Scratch 2.0 which we hope to release later this year. Thanks, M
