I have translated a couple projects from English to Swedish. Translating text is very easy. One project had a help routine that presented how to use the project with both text and audible description. I translated the text and made new sound files in Swedish. The sounds were not as long as the original English and the further into the decription pages, the more out of sync things got. I found the the program had static timed breakpoints that of course didn't fit the new audio. So I rearranged the programming so that it would get each audio chunk and WAIT for it to finish. This makes it very easy to update sound files without problems. If you would like to try the code see: http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/2964963/
