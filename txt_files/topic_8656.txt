Greetings Scratch Community! I was recently awarded a grant to conduct two 3-day long Scratch workshops in Cameroon this summer. One in French in the captial city of Yaound_ and the other in English, in Buea, a city in the Southwest province. I attended the Scratch Annual Conference last August and was inspired by the value and importance of computational thinking skills. Moreover, I recently had the pleasure of meeting Dr. Sugata Mitra, creator of the Hole in the Wall project and discussed my project with him. He had some great ideas of how to incorporate some of the hole-in-the-wall concepts in my workshop.  I'm in the early stages of reserving the venues and recruiting students; however, I have limited resources and am wondering if anyone here has conducted a similar workshop in a developing nation. Has anyone been able to partner with an organization that donates inexpensive netbooks/laptops? I have purchased one netbook with my funding, but am hoping to track down 5 or 6 more. I will be documenting my entire project and perhaps I'll be able to present at one of the Scratch conferences. Thanks. Richard Anderson MS/US Librarian Washington International School
