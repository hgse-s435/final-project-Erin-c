My tech club meets Wednesdays from 3:30-4:30pm New York City time (-5 GMT). They are 14-17 years old. Currently we are teaching Scratch to two 5th graders (10 years old) in Brooklyn, New York, via Skype video. Because my students love doing it, I now have more teachers than students! If you have students who would like to learn Scratch or work together on any project, we'd love to connect with you - whether your student will be in school or in our same time zone (although it would be a lot of fun to connect across time zones). We've been using Skype video but would love to use Google Hangout too. Thanks! Susan Ettenheim

My club too meets Wednesdays...from 2.10-3.40 pm, but we have another time zone! would you develop the same themes? Beatrice
