For those teachers/educators/enthusiasts in California. There will be four Scratch presentations at the annual CUE Conference in Palm Springs. There are two sessions on Thursday (including my hands-on session at 11am), one Friday and a fourth on Saturday. For those at the conference, stop in at my session, I'd love to share project ideas and talk about what you're working on. You can see the schedule of events at the2012 CUE Conference web site. Thanks,Chris

I hope to make it to your Thursday session. I may practuce a litttle "remixing" for my Friday session in Scratch. -- I look forward to meeting you and the others Scratchers.  :-), Scott Moss
