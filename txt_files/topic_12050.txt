Awesome ScratchEd intern Vanessa Gennarelli asked me, "What do educators think about remixing and Scratch? In particular, what concerns do they have about using remixing as a practice in their classrooms?" I suggested that we ask you here on ScratchEd. Any thoughts would be appreciated!

Remixing is a great way of augmenting knowledge by analysing and building upon what has been already done by others. Without "remixes" (hyperlinks!) the Internet won't be there!

Totally agreed! :) Can you think of anything that would cause people to not want to engage in remixing?

As for using remixing in classroom, educators could think that remixing can be interpreted by students as simply "copying" without need to acquire a deeper knowledge of what they copied. It's the teacher's to evaluate how much the student's project is a real evolution of the original project. Sometimes students tend to hide the fact that they started from someone else's project. That is why I'm asking my students to develop Scratch-only projects to present to the discussion for their exams. Even if I explain both Scratch and BYOB, I must rely on the incredibly useful ability of the Scratch website of spotting remixes (something that I do not explain to my students :-) I can immediately understand if a project is not by a student, but Imust be able to show to the student the original project otherwise... it would be just my opinion.

I really like the idea of the "evolution" of a project... Thanks for sharing!
