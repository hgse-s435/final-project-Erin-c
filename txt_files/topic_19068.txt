In Scratch 1.4 a REALLY useful feature was Shift-File then save Project Summary. This enabled me to convince students that they had actually created software programs because there was readible computer code available to see and read. PLEASE tell me that Scratch 2 will give us some way of saying to students that they really have made code by being able to show them! Rgds TJB,.
