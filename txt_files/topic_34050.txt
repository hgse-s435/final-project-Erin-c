I have posted this question in a couple places - I am trying to get my new school to be allowed to install the WeDo extension so we can use our new WeDo equipment. The tech department needs the answers to the following question: Will the extension work if it is installed in the account library and not the main library? Macintosh HD/Library/Internet-Plug-Ins: vs ~/Library/Internet Plug-Ins: Is there a complete spec sheet posted somewhere for the extension? I need to prove that it will not crash other programs... -- Barbara Tennyson Instructional Technology Specialist Broadmeadow Elementary School 120 Broad Meadow Rd Needham, Ma 02492 781-455-0448
