I am the Director of Digital Design at an independent Jacksonville, Florida school and will be in the Central Square, Harvard Square/Tufts area (via T) on February 6, 2015 and would enjoy the opportunity to see how you are using SCRATCH or SCRATCHJr....programming skills/research! Please let me know if you are able to share a visit! Thank you,
