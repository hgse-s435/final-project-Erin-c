I'm super excied for the conference! Looking through the program, I had a few questions about a couple of the sessions: What's "My Excellent Vacation" all about? also, what's "The Windows and Doors of Scratch"? and finally... what type of Government Recognition is going to be talked about in the "Attaining Government Recognition for a Scratch Outreach Program..."? Is that for funding or for program status (like 21st Century programs, or something like that). Thanks y'all see ya in a week or so!

Hi Emily, I've posted a more detailed version of the program, which contains all of the session descriptions. Hope that helps! K
