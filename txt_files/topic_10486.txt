Hello, I have been asked by my school if I could provide a copy of the group photo that was taken on our last day of the workshop. They want to post it on the school website. Where can I find a copy of the picture and is it okay if we post it? Gretchen

The photo is available athttp://www.flickr.com/photos/38090850@N08/5992159736/in/pool-1721311@N20 I think it's fine to re-post... Thanks! K
