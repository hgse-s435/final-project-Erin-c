Hello, I teach a sixth grade CS class in which we work on Scratch projects. I want my students to learn how to use online images in a responsible way. I've had a hard time finding firm rules on how to do this, and I was wondering if this is the current thinking on how to do it properly! 1) Search for images using Creative Commons (search.creativecommons.org) 2) When you find an image, save it to your computer 3) Copy a link to the image from the URL 4) Upload the image into Scratch 5) Give a citation to the image using the URL in the "Notes and Credits" section Am I missing anything? This seemed like the best guidance I could give the students. I made an instructional video about it, but I'm very open to suggestions on what else should be included here. http://www.screencast-o-matic.com/watch/con6ehekTE Dawn D.
