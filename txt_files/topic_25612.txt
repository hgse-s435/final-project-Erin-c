I have read that the "Educators' Accounts" are not going to online to later this spring. I am starting this week with my 5th grade-aprox 100 students and next week with my 4th grade-aprox 100 students. Originally I was going to start with the offline 2.0 but have recently decided to use online as I want my students to be able to collaborate, remix and comment.  I am going to make accounts for all 200 students as I want to have some controls in place. My question is this. When the educators accounts come online, will I be able to transfer these accounts to the educator account?

Hi Sandy, Great question. From what I've been told from the Scratch Team, there will be no transfer ability. Sincerely, M
