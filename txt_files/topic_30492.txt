I'm continuing to write Scratch coding lessons targetting Key Learning Areas (KLAs) in English, Arts, Maths and Science, which will hopefully be taken up by Australian (and other) teachers. Students combine Scratch and curriculum. They are also encouraged to remix and demonstrate to their peers and in some cases younger students. Solutions are available in the ScratchIT Studio.
