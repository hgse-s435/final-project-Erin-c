Karen, I thought I had read I had until Feburary 15 to submit a proposal for the Scratch Conference in July. Now I see the date was 1/1/2012. Did something change or did I misread it. I've been wildly working on a proposal to go out this week. Help! Thanks, Vicki Gold

The deadline was originally February 1, but I pushed it back to February 15 because there had been a delay in launching the conference website. Could you let me know where you saw it listed as February 1 so I can go update it? Thanks! K

Wonderful. I will look for the Feb 1st date. Did anything happen to the email notificatiion when I get a response? Vicki
