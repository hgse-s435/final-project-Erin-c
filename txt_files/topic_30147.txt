Hi, Does anyone have a good guide to using the various different bits of kit that could be "plugged" into Scratch - things like Arduino, Lego, Makey Makey etc. I'm finding the resources a little scattered and would like to try out some hardware kit, but not sure which route has longevity as a teaching practice. Many thanks Wendy

Hi Wendy, I'm a new member so just saw this post.. we teach the LEGO WeDO kit as well as SCRATCH so I could help you out with that one. Feel free to email me info@tinytechsclub.com for more information. Thanks! Vrinda
