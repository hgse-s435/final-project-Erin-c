A place to reflect on ideas that arose during our meetup today

I've also begun to use the following hashtag along with several other ScratchEd NYC Meetup attendees on Twitter: #scratchnyc

I created a public Scratch Studio (http://bit.ly/1e5Edit) and added our Doodle Jump game-in-progress (http://bit.ly/1d81pZH) as well as a few other projects I thought might be of interest based on various (fabulous) conversations today. Please feel free to add your own projects, comment, remix, etc.
