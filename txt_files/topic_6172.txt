I think this was discussed during the scratch conf 2008. For very young children (USGrade 1-3) it may not be desirable for them to go onto the global scratch site immediately. Is there a way for a school to "host" a small sharing site so that young students in a Scratch club can share amongst themselves and their teachers, but not with the global site? P.K.

Hi P.K., You might want to check outhttp://scratched.media.mit.edu/discussions/how-do-i/set-scratch-server-- which discusses this issue... Thanks! K

Thanks Karen for the quick reply. Iguess I didn't dig deep enough on the forums! sorry about that. ScratchR seems like the thing to do. I'll try and report back. I just got the go ahead at our school to start the club, very excited. (Park Street School -- only one T stop south of you guys). P.K.
