We just made a simple video of our workshop...All teachers enjoyed the three day class. Teachers networked, discussed the opportunities to teach Scratch, brainstormed the challenges, state standards and Scratch and much more... We respect and appreciate the time they spent leaving their family to attend this workshop. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJ89Rrg6Etw&feature=youtu.be stay tuned...more workshops are planned... THANK YOU MIT and SCRATCH TEAM FOR GIVING THE OPPORTUNITY FOR TEACHERS TO LEARN PROGRAMMING. -Sankar Srivatsa Founder, Seal Point Academy
