Hello Scratchers, I'm an editor at No Starch Press--you may know our previous books about Scratch, includingLearn to Program with Scratch, The Official ScratchJr Book,orSuper Scratch Programming Adventure. https://www.nostarch.com/learnscratch https://www.nostarch.com/scratchjr https://www.nostarch.com/scratch We're working on a few new Scratch books these days. And so I'm looking for anexperiencedScratch educator or Scratch team member for a short-term reviewing project, for a new book. I'm looking for someone to help read the book's text, run the code, and offer any suggestions on the pedagogy and the game logic itself, too. The book is made up of an intro to Scratch and then 8 games. It's a project book designed for kids and parents, just 180 pages or so long. I'm aiming to complete a review in 2 months time or so--reading and commenting on one chapter per week, basically.The project is paid. Candidates who aren't selected for the formal review will still get an advance peek at our book, a chapter or two. Scratch experience andEnglish language proficiency required. Please contact me directly viatyler@nostarch.com Best, Tyler tyler@nostarch.com?
