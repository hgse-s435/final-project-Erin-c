Participating in the Engagement from Scratch workshop at SOTF12 or came across the presentation elsewhere? Use this space to network with other educators exploring Scratch in their classroom. Share ideas, reflections, successes, experiences, etc. here.

You can access the projects referenced in the presentation by accessing my gallery collection.

My students are excited to share what they are working on with others. It is a very good feature here on Scratch. We will see how it goes soon.
