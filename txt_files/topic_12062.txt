HI! This is the best venue I can think of for my question although I know it's not quite the right one. Does anybody know how I can check if a BYOB sprite has a parent? I'm looking to delete all clones except the prototype. There is an attribute parent block but I don't know how to check if this block is null or not. Thanks!

Compare the block to (from Operators). If the comparison in True than the sprite has no parent.

Thanks! Works a charm. - mulhern

The answer was a big help. But I think it raises a problem that has arisen in programming languages over and over again. When I evaluate I get . Now, it turns out that is equal to which is why the suggestion works. But, even though is equal to if I try to use it in the same way as I run into difficulties. This creates a sort of semantic difficulty because the two values are clearly not equal. Would a separate operator be better?
