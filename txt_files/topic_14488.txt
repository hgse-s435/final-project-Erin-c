I'm developing this to use firstly in after school robot club and then I want to use a set of 6 RaspberryPi in a Year6 class as an alternative to using the DataHarvest FlowGo hardware/GO software. I love the FlowGo Hardware (but can't afford a load of them at 99 each) and I don't love the GO software (compared to Scratch :) ) so I've taken the pi-face interface software (July 2012 edition) and modified it so that you can control the GPIO pins on a RaspberryPi and therefore start using Scratch to control external devices as cheaply as possible.
