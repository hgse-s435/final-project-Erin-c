Hello Can someone please clarify for me this oint. What version of scratch are we using online- 1.4 or 2.0 ? Also how do we get the version that works offline? thx David

Hi David, I think both of your questions are addressed in the Scratch Team's FAQ:?https://scratch.mit.edu/info/faq Hope that helps! Willa, on behalf of the ScratchEd Team
