I am fairly new to this, but am interested in blending an existing unit I have on Rube Goldberg Machines (physically creating them) with an application of it on Scratch. Is there anyone out there, that has lessons or ideas for helping kids (grades2-5) make simple machines like this using scratch? I would really appreciate help with ideas.
