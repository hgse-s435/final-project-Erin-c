Duke University is hostingCS4HS@Duke,a great opportunity designed for high school educators to learn about new ways to teach and use computer science in the classroom. This two day workshop is filled with examples from across the discipline that can be integrated into classrooms and become part of curricula at different levels. Participants will have a chance to work with faculty, educators, and researchers from Duke and other institutions, regional and national high schools, and from Google as part of a two day introduction to many aspects of computer science. Among the topics at the workshop: Exploring Computer Science Computer Science Principles App Inventor Scratch Alice The workshop will take place Oct 27-28, at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina.
