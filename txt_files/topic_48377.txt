Hi, I am interested in how mathematics teachers are integrating Scratch in their mathematics calssroom. Especially, I would like to hear some stories of how you begin with Scratch and how much technological knowledge you need to begin to teach mathematics with Scratch. Thank you so much.

Hi Jinsook, Great question! Math and Scratch are super complimentary. Here are a few resources that might be useful: 1. We're hosting a TwitterChat tomorrow night on Math and Scratch. You can join by following #ScratchEdChat. If the time isn't convenient for you, we'll post a recap of the conversation the following week via our handle on Twitter: @ScratchEdTeam 2. This Scratch for Every Subject piece features a collection of Math integration ideas:http://scratched.gse.harvard.edu/resources/scratch-every-subject-math 3.?There are many example projects, lessons, and unit plans for Scratch in this Cross-Curricular Guide: http://scratched.gse.harvard.edu/resources/scratch-every-subject-math For getting started with Scratch, check out our New to Scratch Page:?http://scratched.gse.harvard.edu/resources/new-scratch Hope that's a good start! Keep us posted on your progress! Willa, on behalf of the ScratchEd Team
