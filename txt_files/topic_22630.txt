Hi all. I teach Scratch to 6th graders and am transitioning this year to 2.0 I love all the features, but we invariably have multiple login issues. Today 2 kids couldn't get in at all. We use Win7 on our network. I have tried latest version of Chrome and FF, and IE10, all with the same results. I read about hitting refresh, which sometimes works but not always. I had students restart computers, cleared the cache, etc. I don't want to go back to 1.4, but I'd rather have something that always works even if it's not the latest and greatest. Any and all suggestions welcome! TIA, Bob Irving Lancaster Country Day School Lancaster, PA

Hi Bob, I'm sorry to hear that you and your students are having trouble logging in. Do you have the latest version of Flash installed? I'm not sure if that would make any significant difference, but it might be useful for using Scratch 2.0. If you continue to have trouble, you could write to the Scratch Team at help@scratch.mit.edu. They might know if something is going on. There's also an offline editor (beta) available for Scratch 2.0 if you're interested. You can download it at http://scratch.mit.edu/scratch2download. Sincerely, Michelle Chung, on behalf of the ScratchEd Team

Thanks for the reply. We do have Flash updated, so I don't think that is the problem. I'm desperate enough to use the offline editor, but that really takes most of the fun out of 2.0. I will send an email to the help desk. Bob Irving
