Boston Scratch educator, Paulina Haduong, is looking for 1-2 volunteers to help facilitate a Scratch workshop for Boston Cares/Tech Goes Home. Boston Cares is a big nonprofit volunteer coordinator in the Greater Boston Area, and Tech Goes Home does really wonderful digital literacy programming/hardware support for low-income families and communities across the country through a "train-the-trainer" model, where trained community members/librarians/teachers facilitate workshops for local families. TGH is particularly excited about introducing Scratch to parents and families. This workshop is geared towards adult volunteers who would like to explore Scratch a little bit before they figure out how to structure and facilitate their own workshops. No need to be an "expert" at Scratch - just general enthusiasm and a willingness to help others is enough! Workshop details Saturday, October 1 12:30-3pm (lunch provided) Location: St. Mark's Community Education Center (Links to an external site.) (Dorchester) Interested? Email paulina_haduong (at) mail (dot) harvard (dot) edu.
