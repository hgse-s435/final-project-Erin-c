Hello all, The new Teacher Scratch accounts are wonderful. I can't figure out how to delete a student from my class. Any help? Thanks, Elaine

Hi Elaine, We're so glad to hear that you're liking teacher accounts! I found this on the Scratch Team's FAQ page (the Scratch team manages Teacher Accounts): Can I delete student accounts? It is not possible for a teacher to delete a student account. A student can delete their own account in their Account Settings. Hope that helps! Willa, on behalf of the ScratchEd Team

Thank you for your help and that solves my problem. :)
