Hey ScratchEd-ers, My name is Eric Schilling. I'm the Scratch Online Community Manager and former Creative Computing Online Workhship faciliator (CCOW!).I wanted to reach out and alert you all of an update coming to Scratch: Email cofirmation. Starting on Feburary 13th, 2015, Scratch account creation will include an email confirmation request. Confirming the email address will enable the account to use all social actions such as sharing projects, commenting, creating studios, etc. Unconfirmed accounts will only be able to create and save unshared projects. All accounts created before Feburary 13th, 2015, will not need to confirm their account to use social actions. Those accounts will be uneffected. I understand this may cause some friction creating student accounts. I would suggest having your students use your email address, if you are unsure the students can receive email from @scratch.mit.edu. (We are deligently working on Scratch Educator accounts to make this entire process simpler!) Please let me know if you have any questions. Thanks! E

Hello Eric, It would be great if "sharing" can be a tiered and an optional feature, even if the email is confirmed. I teach 2nd to 5th graders and prefer that the students not share publicly without their parents knowledge and permission. Creating studios and sharing within the class would be beneficial to the class and manageable for me as instructor. Thank you! D.
