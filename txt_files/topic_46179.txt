I have been using a Scratch Educator account since September and I love it. It takes away the hassle of getting parents to create and share account information with the school. I have hit a snag, though. In one of my studios, I seem to have run out of space. It this possible? Is there a limit to the number of projects that can be added to a studio in an Educator Account?
