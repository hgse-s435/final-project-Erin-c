The ScratchEd Team is revising the Scratch curriculum guide draft, and we want to develop activities for better supporting student reflection throughout their design process. Do you use "design notebooks" with your students? Help us improve this part of the curriculum guide by sharing your feedback inthis short survey. Your participation is greatly appreciated. Thanks! Tomoko and Michelle, on behalf of the ScratchEd Team
