Last december 10 people met at a Scratch2015AMS afterpartyand discussed things learned at the conference, plans for the future, setting up a Dutch Scratch wiki, working on Dutch translation, showing ideas, ... It was all day (10:00 - 20:00) and big fun. Most if not all of us wanted to meet at a more regular basis and I think we shoudl set something up to ease meetings like these. So that's one of our to-do's at our next meeting: Monday March, 28 2016 ("easter monday") 10:00 - 20:00 Haparandaweg 67-B5 1013 BD Amsterdam You're most welcome to join (part of) this meeting.
