I'm an editor at No Starch Press, an independent technical publisher based in San Francisco. Over the past year or so I've been editing a book about Scratch. The book is not academic, and it's not a teacher's guide; it has no larger goal than to get kids excited about programming. I'm looking for a technical reviewer who can weigh in on the merits of the approach, ideally someone with direct experience using Scratch with kids. The work is 200 pages over 11 chapters. The reviewing work will likely continue through the next 3-4 months, and we'd pay you for your work and credit you. If you're curious about this project, please respond to tyler (at) nostarch (dot) com via email, summarizing your experience with Scratch. If you're unable to provide a formal technical review, but would still like to read a pre-release copy of the book in a few months, I'm happy to share that as well. Just drop a line and I'll make sure you receive a PDF. Thanks! Tyler tyler at nostarch dot com

I hope you've had some responses to this very interesting opportunity! If you're looking for more/different people, please let me know -- I'd be happy to make some recommendations. Thanks, K

Thanks so much, Karen. The response from the community was amazing. Thanks to everyone that sent their info my way. The position is currently filled. I'll be sure to come back and share what we're working on soon. Tyler
