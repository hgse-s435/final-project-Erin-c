Scratch Day is a worldwide network of gatherings, where people come together to meet other Scratchers, share projects and experiences, and learn more about Scratch. We hope that you'll consider hosting or attending an event. Check out the Scratch Day siteathttp://day.scratch.mit.eduand feel free to post questions on this threadfor more information.

I am very interested in this event! I need more "sandbox" playtime!
