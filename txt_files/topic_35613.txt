Is anyone aware of scholarships/programs for teachers who want to go back to school to become highly qualified computer science teachers? Seems like MIT or Harvard should do something like this. Many thanks, Ben

I'd love to learn more about this. I did happen to come across this website. I haven't had too much time to explore it, but it looks interesting: http://www.csta.acm.org/ProfessionalDevelopment/sub/TeacherWorkshops.html
