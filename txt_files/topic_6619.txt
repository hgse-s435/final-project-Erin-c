hello, i'd like to introduce a few students to programming with Scratch, especially for its drag and drop visual way of working; before doing that, i need some help to understand the underlying differences between Scratch and Alice, which is fairly similar; thank you in advance for your expertise !

In general I think Scratch is great for students with little or no background who want to get a fast start and be able to do lots of things quickly. Whereas Alice is meant more as an introductory tool for learning computer science. Scratch:  Written in Squeak  Limited amount of functionality; specifically no i/o, no paratmeter passing or return values, no recursion, no exception handling, no inheritance  Since there is limited functionality the students can't ever go wrong.  Easy to learn interface  2-D Alice:  Written in Java  Most of the functionality of Java is available in Alice  Students can run into some serious errors  The interface can be overwhelming for some students  3-D
