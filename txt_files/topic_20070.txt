I am exploring how Physicians can use Scratch to teach, deliver medical related material and communicate with the patients. We are non-profit Orgainzation. We are looking new ways to educate patients. Mukhtar M. Rana, PhD President & Executive Director Health IT Services, Inc. www.healthitservices.org

Hi Mukhtar, interesting idea. I'm an optometrist and run computer clubs for kids. I hadn't thought too much about making scratch projects to show my patients, but it's certainly an idea worth exploring. I'll think about possible applications and let you know what I come up with. Cheers, Martin www.nerdsville.org www.optomcpd.com

Hi Mukhtar, me again :) I made this little presentation in about 20mins. It's a little rough around the edges, but I think it shows that your idea definitely has potential! http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/11353227/ I'd love to see more of these. Cheers, Martin
