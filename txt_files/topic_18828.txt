Hi everyone, In this website, the 2nd and 3rd graders in my class describe and demonstrate the "conservation inventions" that they recently developed: http://tinyurl.com/a4trcxd The projects have been posted to the Scratch website, though it's hard to run them without the "accessories." We'd love to hear any feedback that you may have, either via the Scratch website, or via the "Comments" sections that are below each project on our own website. Thanks very much! Sincerely, Larry P.S. I was part of the Creative Computing 2011 group, so hello to all of you who were there!
