cs teachers what you do in 9 weeks? (1-hour meeting) how scratch can relate to upper cs concepts can scratch lead to oop concepts -- e.g. methods/public /private through calls (broadcasts), especially if you encourage kids to use single-stepping to watch how things are going provide them with challenges to think as computer scientists keep things closed at the beginning, then let the kids go creating their own projects a look on how universities are using scratch (Berkeley/Snap) scratch vs. other choices (e.g. greenfoot, alice, app inventor) kids were more excited to play with app inventor (not about alice): lots of possibilities. scratch can be used with other subject matters: geometry, algebra, physics, history... but scratch cannot be used directly for the ap exam, although it will help computational thinking. the ability to share is more motivating kids .. theyd like the idea of other viewing their projects proving sth personalized would help kids collaborate appropriately sharing concerns: accounts for the class with no need for parents permission privacy concerns! Thanks to Abdulrahman for taking the notes in a very free flowing discussion.
