I have several students who have completed and loved Course 1of Code.org's Coursework (it's geared towards specific age groups) but are too young to understand Course 2. Is there a way to create a background or scene on Scratch that allows the kids to use their own coding ability. It has the character and a goal to meet, however they have to tell the character where to go. It's for ages 4-6 if that helps. Any thoughts?
