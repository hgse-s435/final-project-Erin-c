Hi everyone, As you may know, the Lifelong Kindergarten group at the MIT Media Lab has been working on a new generation of Scratch, which we call Scratch 2.0. (You can see a preview of Scratch 2.0 in this video.) If you'd like to help us test Scratch 2.0, please leave a comment here, with a link to your Scratch website profile. (For example, I would add a comment with a link to http://scratch.mit.edu/users/karenb) When we're ready for more testers (most likely in a few weeks), we'll send you an invitation via email, with an explanation of how to access the Scratch 2.0 site. Thank you so much for your help... Sincerely, Karen

I would like to test Scratch 2.0 with my students. Many of them will be excited to test it out. http://scratch.mit.edu/users/cmeltzer

Same here:http://scratch.mit.edu/users/anunez After attending the conference and workshop this past summer, I have introduced Scratch to our 3rd, 4th, and 5th grade students. They are presently finishing their A Little Bit About Me projects and those projects will be uploaded to a StV gallery that will be created soon. The students are LOVING learning Scratch! On Oct 26th, I and another colleague will be presenting Scratch to diocesan teachers of Arlington VA. So YES! I am very interested in piloting the Web 2.0 version. ~Anna Nunez

Have been teaching scratch for over three years and would be eager to learn and work with 2.0

I teach Scratrch at second level in Ireland as a cross curricular tool and as part of a Software Development course. Would love to take part in the Alpha. My Scratch is: http://scratch.mit.edu/users/conpower

If I can be of service I would be interested in testing Scratch 2.0. I'm currently working with middle school students who have started their own Scratch Club as well as math teachers interested in integrating Scratch into their curriculum. My Scratch handle is: http://scratch.mit.edu/users/WestBendEast Thanks, Chris

How do we know if we are among the lucky ones ;) ?

Hi Richard, I need your Scratch username. (Please refer to the original post.) Thanks, K

Hi Bruce, I need your Scratch username. (Please refer to the original post.) Thanks, K

Dear Olivier, I'll need your Scratch username. (Please refer to original post.) Thanks, K

***THIS TOPIC IS NOW LOCKED*** Thanks to everyone who responded. I've sent the list of Scratch usernames on to those who manage 2.0 access -- I'll post here again when I've sent out the emails explaining how to access the site. (This should be sometime next week.)
