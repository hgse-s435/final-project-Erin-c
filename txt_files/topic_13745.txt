Last night was fun! It was great to get to know people on a more personal level. I believe that my husband has my notes from our discussions so when I reconnect with him later on I will see if I can decipher my notes and post them!

It was great meeting everyone!

Thanks so much for posting this!

I found my notes from last night! Here they are: http://csunplugged.org Haptic=hands on Don't forget we can LOCK ROTATION so our sprites won't go upside down on us! To teach sequencing, bring your students to a place like a cafeteria and have them tell each other how to maneuver between the tables and chairs only using words. Movies discussed: Bottle Shock Sideways Arduino:http://blog.makezine.com/arduino/ Andrew, maybe you could post your deck-of-cards method to teaching binary. There were other ideas but these are what I was able to get down on paper...or rather, my placemat! We had a great dinner with all of you. I hope we meet again!
