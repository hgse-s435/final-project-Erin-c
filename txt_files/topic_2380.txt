Hi, I thought everyone might like to know that Animation10 - the 3rd Annual UK Schools Computer Animation Competition 2010, has now launched. Entrants can create their animations using Scratch (also: Alice, Greenfoot, Flash, or Serif DrawPlus). For full details, and to register (registrants get free posters and flyers) please visit the Animation10 website: www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/Animation10/ Animation10 is open to all UK schoolchildren aged between 7 and 19. The deadline for entries is 1 April 2010. Animation10 is run by the School of Computer Science at The University of Manchester, and is funded by Google and Electronic Arts, and in association with BBC 21CC, cs4fn, and the Family Friendly Film Festival. Best wishes! Toby -- Toby Howard Senior Lecturer Deputy Director of the Undergraduate School School of Computer Science The University of Manchester www.cs.man.ac.uk/~toby www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/Animation10

Thanks for the information! I just took a look at last year's competition winners. It was so much fun watching the animations. Is there any way to see just the ones that were made with Scratch? Thanks! K
