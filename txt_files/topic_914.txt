I am looking for ways to use Scratch to deliver the MA frameworks curriculum in fourth grade. Love some suggestions beyond asking the students to create a tall tale... Thanks for any help that you can provide! Janet Tortora

Do you have any particular subject in mind?

I'm also curious about the curricular areas you're thinking of. Maybe you could share a link to the frameworks that you're looking at? Thanks! K
