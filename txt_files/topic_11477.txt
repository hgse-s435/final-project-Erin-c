Intro Scratch Workshop for Educators Saturday, January 14, 2012? 12:00pm-4:00pm @ MIT Media Lab? Hosted by members of the ScratchEd Team Are you interested in helping your students: imagine new possibilities of what they can do with computers? learn to express themselves creatively with new technologies? explore computational ideas through personally-meaningful projects? Join us at the MIT Media Lab for this four-hour BYOL (Bring Your Own Laptop) workshop, where we will introduce you to Scratch, a programming environment that enables students to create interactive stories, games, animations, and simulations. As students create and share Scratch projects, they learn to think creatively, reason systematically, and work collaboratively -- and develop as computational thinkers and computational creators. This event is open to all Boston-area educators who have no prior Scratch experience or are looking for a refresher course. During this workshop, we will: explore the core ideas underlying Scratch experience Scratch through demonstrations and hands-on activities discuss strategies for integrating Scratch into classroom practice introduce you to ScratchEd, the website where educators share their Scratch ideas, experiences, and resources We particularly encourage educators from the same school, program, etc. to attend together as a group. The workshop is $10 and includes lunch, a copy of the Scratch Curriculum Guide, a set of Scratch Cards, and other resources. Register online at http://jan2012workshop.eventbrite.com/
