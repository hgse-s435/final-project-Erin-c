Hi ScratchEd friends! I wanted to share a great opportunity for your youth.Make-to-Learn, a new thematic initiative of the DML Research Hub being led by Indiana University's Creativity Labs, is partnering withInstructables.com, one of the biggest online DIY communities, to host theMake-to-Learn Youth Contest, where kids can share their makes, talk about what they learned in the process, and check out lots of other creative makes from across the country. The contest is open untilApril 15th, and we invite all sorts of makes - digital, physical, electronic, gastronomic, whatever! Of course, Scratch projects would be great, just as long as a youth made it. Details about submission can be found here: http://www.instructables.com/contest/maketolearn You can download a flyerherethat can be posted in your spaces, shared with youth and educators, posted to listservs, etc. Definitely feel free to share widely! We'd love to give as many youth a chance to participate as possible. (And also have a chance to win super cool prizes like iPads, dream makers kits, and more!). If you have any questions about the contest, I'd of course be happy to answer. Best, Rafi
