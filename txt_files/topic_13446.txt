Hi Vera, I'm arriving on Monday afternoon with 2 of my collegues from Austin. We could probably meet up on Tuesday evening - feel free to email at eweerts (at) austinkids (dot) org and we can exchange contact info. We are definitely planning on checking out Museums, restaurants, and other fun stuff. We're doing pre conference stuff on Wednesday, but don't have specific plans before that. Cheers! Emily

Awesome!...
