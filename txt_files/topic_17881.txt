At the April 2013 Scratch Educator Meetup, a group of HS Scratch educators got together to share ideas for creating a pong game from, well, scratch. Laura Johnson took some notes of the discussion that are shared here: Specifications: - start with one row of blocks and one ball --> have to move the ball to the wall of blocks using the paddle - when the ball hits the blocks _ > block has to disappear - 3 choices for triggering disappearance: paint a block in the background and using "touching" block sprite hitting sprite coordinates > ball has to change direction - how to simulate the angle that would result in the real world? Questions / Considerations: - how to decide what level of specification to offer students regarding game mechanics? --> dependent on time and level of students - storyboarding / psuedo-flowcharting is helpful to plan game - using this as an advanced Scratch activity, but still providing various levels of challenges within it - pros and cons of showing students the final product (as in, this is what you're aiming for) vs. telling them the specifications and letting them conceptualize it themselves - value in taking time to discuss various approaches to the same problem / set of constraints, are some better than others? Do you have other suggestions for specifications/questions/considerations? Please share them below!
