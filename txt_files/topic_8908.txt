January Webinar: Four Questions About Scratch Monday, January 24, 2011 7pm-8pm EST Hosted by Mitch Resnick and Karen Brennan In this webinar, we will discuss four questions about Scratch: What is Scratch? What is good Scratch? What is Scratch good for? How do different people think about these questions? We will share how these questions relate to the major themes of a recently-funded project that explores computational thinking and design-based approaches to learning. All webinars will be recorded and shared on ScratchEd. Join us online at http://connectpro53415882.adobeconnect.com/jan2011/

Are there any plans to alternate days for these webinars? Or will they always be Mondays? -- I am teaching class (on the west coast) at the time this will be taking place.

Hi Susan, My apologies -- as I mentioned in another thread in response to Anders, we really struggled to find a time that worked for a lot of people. As with everything, we're approaching this iteratively, and I could imagine the webinar time being changed. I'll make sure to announce changes on ScratchEd. In the interim, all of the webinars are being recorded and will be shared online the next day. Sincerely, K

Hi Karen, Like Susan, these times are not good for me (I'm usually getting my kids and myself to school and just starting to teach). But, I completely understand the difficulty finding a time. I thought it might help, though, to give a higher profile to the webinars. I have had an off and on success in connecting. It might be that when I click on the link when you "announce" a webinar, that is different from the link for a recording. Would you consider a specific webinar page?Or in the resources, a Webinar box in the right hand pane? This might it easy to find the recording links. Cheers, Wayne
