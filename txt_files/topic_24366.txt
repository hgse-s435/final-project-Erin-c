Hi I'm new to this board and to Scratch. I'm very much interested in teaching kids Scratch. I watched the video on one hour coding and tried it for the first time. I also installed the program and read some documentation. I was wondering if It was possible to do the same as one hour coding, that is explain scratch with videos and allow kids to program directly within the browser (ta the same time and in the same Window). I find this prresentation very convenient for kids to learn and progress rapidly... I was thinking maybe integrate it on my website. Can I do that? Thank you for your feedback
