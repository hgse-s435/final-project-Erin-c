Recap Introductions and a Question- After informalnetworking with coffee and Flour pastries, everyone gathered in a circle for introductions. Michelle invited each person to share a brief introduction, and then asked to answer the following question: "What is one thing you are looking forward to doing in May?" Co-Creating the Schedule- Attendees generated session ideas on small stickies in small groups of three, then we thematically clustered the stickies on the wall to see which topics people were most interested in exploring during breakout sessions. Breakout Sessions - Four different breakout sessions emerged. Many participants new to Scratch were interested in having an introductory session, which Rosemary volunteered to organize around building up a maze project. Lorraine hosted a show & tell to share recent student work and Adam facilitated a discussion on supporting intermediate Scratchers. Lunch- During lunch, Michelle shared upcoming events, Lucia presented her work from a university course in Mexico City using Scratch, and Lynn demonstrated how she uses Edmodo to manager her Scratch curriculum.
