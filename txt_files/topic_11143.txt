Hi folks, I am a teacher with little knowledge in Computing. Can I still assist and lead during LEGO We Do / Scratch activities? Well actually I am very knowledgeable in computing because that's my profession (IT Consultant). I am starting a project (XO olpc laptop, Lego We Do and Scratch) at a primary school and I am thinking in what extent should I give training to the teachers who will eventually take lead and give instructions in the classroom. My role is to provide and setup the technological environment. In the end teachers should be capable of setting up their own sessions and supporting students in the process. Is there any documented practise how to prepare teachers for a Lego We Do/Scratch acctivities? Kind regards, Urso Wieske
