Some of my students claim their Scratch programs run differently (timings are off?) on the website than do when running locally...are there known problems with this?

That is an existing issue with the java player used on the site. However, in my experience, a lot of the trouble that studnts have with timing has to do with how they trigger events. Trying to sync things up with the "timer" or with they "wait___ sec" blocks will typically suffer from some sort of lag. On the hand, chaining a series of events together with the "boadcast," or "broadcast and wait," blocks will help a lot. This tutorial on creating dialog may help clarify what I am describing.

The dialog tutorial is nice. How about one for changing scenes (including backgrounds and characters)?

Great idea. Here's my first pass at it: http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/ashbyr1/714297 If you share it with students, please let me know if they ask for clarification about anything, so I can make improvements to it.
