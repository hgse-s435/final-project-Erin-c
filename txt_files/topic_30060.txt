Hello co-Scratchers. Under supervision of Prof. Dr. van der Maas, I am conducting research on a computer-adaptive test which helps children to learn Scratch. If you are interested in our project, see this blog:catforscratch.wordpress.com If you are interested in collaborating or helping a little bit with this research, do not hesitate to contact me. Have a great day, Jan
