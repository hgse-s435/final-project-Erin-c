People in the ScratchEd community may be interested in http://citizenmaths.com/, a new free open online maths course which makes good use of Scratch to help learners get to grips with powerful ideas in maths. The Citizen Maths course goes live 12 September, is open for registration now, and will remain open for registration beyond the "go-live" date. We've a range of support material on the Citizen Maths "Information Hub" at http://info.citizenmaths.com/, including a 4 page overview of the thinking behind the course. Citizen Maths is for anyone who can make good use of it, and we strongly welcome feedback about it from all categories of user. Weve designed it with independent learners in mind: that is, for people who are not enrolled on a formal course and who want to improve their maths. But we also expect that some teachers, tutors or trainers, will find that Citizen Maths is a useful adjunct to their own work, and that they will give their students active encouragement to use Citizen Maths too. It may also be that parents of school-aged children decide to use Citizen Maths to develop their own maths so that they can help their children. Separately we know that people involved in mathematics education or in online learning more generally may want to sign up for Citizen Maths simply to check it out.
