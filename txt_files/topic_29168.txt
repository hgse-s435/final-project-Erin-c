I have a student who seems to be invisible. I search for his username and his project name and they both come up with nothing. I'm looking forzack88753 who made the project  Pixel Zombies by Paul  and get nothing. Ideas?

Hi Janet, You should be able to find a Scratch users' profile by typing in: http://scratch.mit.edu/user/(insert username here) For example, my Scratch username is mchung, so you can find me at: http://scratch.mit.edu/user/mchung I tried to search for http://scratch.mit.edu/zack88753 and didn't find anything...Perhaps you can check with the student again? Thanks, M

Your search forhttp://scratch.mit.edu/zack88753 should have beenhttp://scratch.mit.edu/users/zack88753/

Thanks. I thought I should have been able to find him by simply putting the name in the search box.
