Hi If you have been excited about Scratch 3.0, please take a look at our version of iTCH (Scratch for Schools and Districts) that now includes saving and restoring projects with Scratch 3.0 as well. It's available here: http://www.itchcode.com We are still in the process of migrating our lessons over to 3.0 but in the meantime you can create, save and use 3.0 with your entire class. Regards, The iTCHcode Team PS. You can also pre-order my book for Scratch 3.0 from amazon here.
