Hi there. I am doing some background research on the number of schools in Singapore and the ASEAN region which use Scratch as part of the curriculum or as an enrichment programme. I was told that Scratch was a platform being used in a local competition for primary schools in Singapore and was referred to the code xtreme apps competition at http://www.itsc.org.sg/codeXtremeApps2010.html. Unfortunately, there seems to be no publicity of the results even though the competition is over. If you have some information, please comment. Thanks so much. Have a lovely day. Ai Boon
