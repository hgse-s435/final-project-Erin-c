Themessage that you create for "When I Receive", and the blocks that follow that message "name" - is that similar to creating a procedure in logo?

Yes, I think of "broadcast" and "when I receive" as a way of implementing procedures.

Great. Thanks.

Except that one cannot pass parameters (unfortunately) as in LOGO. Is anything in this direction in the pipeline? Thanks. Bernd.

As for passing parameters in future versions of Scratch, it's something that we have discussed (and continue to discuss). But there's always a tension between adding functionality and keeping things easy for beginners. You might be interested in BYOB (Build Your Own Blocks), a project developed by Scratch/ScratchEd community memberJens M_nig. I know thatBrian Harvey has also thought a lot about this.

In the meantime, I have discovered a scary number of feature requests in forum posts all over the website, so I'm taking back that particular one of mine:-) After all, it's a strength of Scratch that it is not overloaded with features, even if that means that some things cannot be done. But that's ok - with a pair of scissors, you can cut paper, but nobody expects it to fell a tree... I now vote for keeping Scratch easy also in the future.
