Hi everybody, I'm an italian teacher (primary school) reading "New frameworks for studying and assessing the development of computational thinking" (Brennan, Resnick, 2012) I found this interesting tool for assessing projects: http://happyanalyzing.com/ But it seems to work only with version 1.4. Is therea tool similar to Scrape for version 2.0 of Scratch? thanks Alessandro Rabbone, Torino, Italia

Hey Alessandro. We are currently trying to set up an assessment tool with my supervisor. Unfortunately, it is very difficult to automately assess Scratch projects. Still, there are some possibilities to assess Scratch, e.g. Hairball[1]. Boe, B., Hill, C., Len, M., Dreschler, G., Conrad, P., & Franklin, D. (2013, March). Hairball: Lint-inspired static analysis of scratch projects. InProceeding of the 44th ACM technical symposium on Computer science education(pp. 215-220). ACM. Best, Jan
