March Webinar: Computational Thinking Concepts Monday, March 28, 2011 7pm-8pm EST Hosted by Karen Brennan Scratch supports the cultivation of computational thinking, a set of concepts, practices, and perspectives that draw on ideas from the world of computing. In the past few years, there has been a growing recognition of the importance of computational thinking for understanding and solving problems in a wide range of contexts, not only in the field of computer science. As young people program and share Scratch projects, they begin to develop as computational thinkers: they learn core computational and mathematical concepts, while also learning important strategies for designing, problem solving, and collaborating. In this first of three webinars focused on computational thinking, we will focus on computational thinking concepts (sequences, loops, parallelism, events, conditionals, operators, variables, and lists). All webinars will be recorded and shared on ScratchEd. Join us online at http://connectpro53415882.adobeconnect.com/mar2011/

Looking forward!

The March Webinar was fantastic! Thank you Karen.

I''m looking forward this webinar in Korea. So, I try to connect the webniar, but I can't connect it. ?? I received this message: "The host has ended this meeting. Thank you for attending."

This was an auspicious start. I'm looking forward to next month's installment.

Thanks to everyone who attended last night's webinar. The recording, slides, and links to resources are now available:http://scratched.media.mit.edu/resources/computational-thinking-concepts-march-2011-webinar
