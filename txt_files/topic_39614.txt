Join us for our KY Scratch Educator Meetup on January 30, 2016 from 10am to noon at Awesome, Inc. in Lexington, KY. Meetups are a great way to build your personal/professional learning network and have fun learning from others using Scratch! Our meetups are open to all educators, parents, librarians and community partners interested in learning more about how the power of creative computing can transform learning! Register to attend on our Eventbrite page. We hope to see you!

Hi Leanna, I'd love to attend one of your meetups. Do you know when the next one might be? (I have a scheduling conflict on January 30...) K
