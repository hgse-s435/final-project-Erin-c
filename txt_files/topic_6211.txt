Over the past few months, I have been working with a few schools in New Delhi, India on Scratch. I want them to interact with a school in America, especially in the Cambridge/Boston area (where I am located). Would anyone be interested in setting up some sort of Scratch connection between their school and a school in New Delhi? If so, please email me at aksaigal@mit.edu. Thanks, Arun

Hello Arun, If you haven't found anyone in the Boston area, you'd be welcome to join in with a Scratch professional learning community project that will continue this fall. Last spring it included monthly teacher conversations plus a joint Scratch project between students at five locations in three countries. We'll get going again in another couple weeks. Here's the powerpoint from our panel at the Scratch Conference: http://scratched.media.mit.edu/resources/share-conversations-about-scratch-schools Karen Randall

I am very interested. I actually came to the ScratchEd site to post a request for a school in India. How funny! I work at a private PreK-12 school in Cambridge, and our 6th grade social studies/history teacher is looking to collaborate with a school in India on one or more projects. I would love to discuss this. Please feel free to email me: megan_haddadi@bbns.org Thanks! I look forward to speaking with you, Arun. -Megan
