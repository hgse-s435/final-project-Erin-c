Hi, I am starting Scratch training lessons in a school next week, I will be teaching 10 classes in total, each with 30 pupils. Ihad planned tosetup a teacher account in my own name, then 10 classes,and add 30 pupils to each using csv files. However, when I am finished, I would like the pupils to continue working on Scratch during school computer time. I will be gone from the school at this point. So, if I set the teacher account up using my own email address and details, is there any way for me totransfer the teacher account to the school IT supervisor to manage from his email after I've left? If not, any other suggestions on how I should setup the 300 pupils? Thanks, J
