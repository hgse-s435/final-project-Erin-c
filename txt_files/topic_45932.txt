Hello, I am mentoring 3 new teachers to CS and I was surprised how they responded to the Debut it Unit 1 challenges. The Flip the Cat Debut IT 3 challenge stumped them as it had a Click Sprite Event, followed by turn blocks each turn right 90 degrees. With these 4 blocks, it is impossible to see the cat flip without putting a Wait block in between the turns or using a repeat 4x block with 1 turn 90 and 1 wait. They really didn't know how to guide the students. The Debug 1.2 using glide and the Debug 1.4 requiring students to explore also stomped my new CS teachers. Do you have any advice to give the other than encouraging them to explore the blocks before class to solve the problems? Kelly
