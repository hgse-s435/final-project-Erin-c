Over the summer (2010), I attended the game workshop and we had a wonderful handout that showed examples of different core mechanics of games built in Scratch. Would anyone know where to find that handout online? I'm looking for examples of simple Scratch games that use collecting, vs jumping vs other core mechanics. Thank you!

There were a few games-themed sessions, so I'm not exactly sure what handouts you're referencing. You might be interested in the "Let's Play" resources:http://scratched.media.mit.edu/resources/lets-play Hope that helps, K

Yes, I used that! There were a few sessions a day earlier than the main conference. You were at the Gaming one that I attended. There was a paper handout printed in color that had exemplary but simple games. I'm going to try to find it at school tomorrow. I know that I brought it back and carefully put it somewhere safe because it was such a great handout! At least that when I think I got it!!
