Notes for Robotics Discussion August 11, 2012 Led by: Abdulrahman Idlbi Present: Kim Sivick Anna Nunez Vonda Brown Linda George And a whole lot more people 2 extensions supported officially in Scratch others available for Lego Mindstorms, Aduino, Lego Wedo, Pico Board or Scratch board, etc. Lego Wedo developed by Kindergarten group so Scratch can work with them Can use Enchanting for Robolab and other modifications to Scratch, as well as others With all of the enhancements to Scratch, they work but cannot be uploaded to the website For Pico board, connect it via USB, then go to Sensing in Scratch, check the slider sensor, and make cat move according to the slider value, with a forever loop and set x to slider sensor value Can make the cat jump by using the button pressed and changing y in a forever if loop Also, 4 resistance sensor values Example: Forever loop, Play note value of sensor A = resistance sensor for .5 beats, using the clips along the strip of water As resistance changes, the note changes A search on Kinect2Scratch will get a free download for moving sprites from sensing body Using kinect game controller and Scratch Now with Lego Wedo, can use tilt and distance sensors to make the bird fly across the screen Can make all kinds of animations and games using these controllers Forever Set y to distance sensor value A If tilt sensor value = 4, Change x by -5 If tilt sensor value = 2, Change x by 5 Another link www.Go.warwick.ac.uk/scratchresources Forever Moteor direction reverse Motor on for 1 second Will make the dragons mouth open and close If go to sites for any of the physical controllers, can download the drivers, usually free

Hello, >others available for Lego Mindstorms I have used Scratch with LEGO WeDo (see some project suggestions onhttp://code.google.com/p/scratch-robotics/), but I'm interested in using it with Mindstorms. Could someone please give me a link that explains how to do this? On a related topic: Tom Lauwers is working on Snap! support for the Finch robot:http://www.finchrobot.com/. Thanks Moti
