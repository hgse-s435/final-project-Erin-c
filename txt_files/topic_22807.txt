My 7th and 8th grade students have created games using Scratch thet we would love to share and discuss with other middle school students who have created Scratch games. I think it would be great for them to see what other students have created, and to get feedback from on their own games from other students. Let me know if you are interested.

I am most interested. I am currently teaching a short (8weeks) class using scratch. Our 8th graders are very new to this (as am I). email me at pbacalis@gmail.com I teach in Lyons, CO
