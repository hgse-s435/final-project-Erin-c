Scratch 1.4 allows Scratchers to create musical projects using the "set instrument", "play note", and "play drum" blocks. These blocks make use of music synthesizers built into the OS or Java. Unfortunately, for various reasons, Scratch 2.0 can't use those synthesizers, so we have to build our own synthesizer and musical instrument library. We've made a start. To hear the results so far, you can run musical projects using the Flash-based player on the Scratch website. You'll probably notice that most of our instruments don't sound great. We want to improve both the number and quality of the instruments in Scratch 2.0, and we could use help. We're looking for links to free musical instrument files in SoundFont format (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_font) that we can incorporate into Scratch 2.0.
