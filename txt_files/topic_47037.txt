The document that I used is the Teacher Guide from Scratch Education program. It is a textbook that helps me guide through to teach students how to use coding in Scratch. I am wondering if anyone have any possible ways to find answers for the Reflection Questions from the Teacher's Guide. I don't see any possible answers to the questions. It made me feel helpless to guide them to answer the Reflection Questions if I do not know exactly what its looking for in answers. Can anyone help me??

Hi Ashley, Thanks for posting this question. We just posted an invitation for teachers to share example Design Journals, which will hopefully include example responses to some of the reflection questions. That said, most of the reflection questions don't have one "right" answer, as they're more related to students' processes and ideas. If you're wondering about some of the more conceptual questions.e.g. the "It's Alive" activity on p. 48: "What's the difference between a sprite and a costume?"the "Notes" section is often a good resource. If you want to post some specific examples, I'd be glad to search for various example responses. Hope that helps! Willa, on behalf of the ScratchEd Team
