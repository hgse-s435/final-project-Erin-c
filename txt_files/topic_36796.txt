Researchers at the University of Washington ran an experiment to see how the design of computer science classrooms affected girls interest in taking a computer science class. First, they decorated a classroom in a stereotypical way, often associated with computer science, such as Star Trek posters, computer parts and books. Next, they outfitted the room with accessories not associated with computer science, such as plants and art posters. They then showed both photographs to high school girls and boys, asking them which classroom they prefered. They found that girls had a strong preference for the non-stereotypical classroom.

In addition to designing the physical space, what else do you do to encourage more diverse images of computer science in your learners' minds?
