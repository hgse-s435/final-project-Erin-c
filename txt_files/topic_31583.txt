Hello, I found the Scratch Programming Concepts document for V1.4 but I wonder if there is a similar document for 2.0? There are some programming concepts that are now supported in 2.0 that weren't in 1.4. Thanks --Louis

I would also love some help in using words such as recursive in talking about using Scratch 2.0.

Hi Susan, My suggestion to connect computer science concepts to Scratch is the book by Majed Marji: Marji, M. (2014). Learn to Program with Scratch: A visual introduction to programming with games, art, science, and math. San Francisco: No Starch Press. Retrieved from http://www.nostarch.com/learnscratch I have mixed feelings about the book. On the plus side, it's thorough, detailed and very well illustrated but I think the author misses the boat in connecting Scratch to current software development methodology, namely object-oriented design. The book seems to follow the conventional path to structured programming and doesn't touch on objects at all. In other words, this is a C textbook written in Scratch. He does discuss procedures (ch.4) and recursion (briefly in ch.7), if that helps. All the best --Louis
