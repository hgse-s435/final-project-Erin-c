hello, i cannot do the proper formatting of my posts, as you have already realized ...; i'd like to insert itemized lists, links and wraps etc., the way i see you do; but how ??? i am very sorry for the bad appearance of my posts; thanks

Do you see tools above the post editor window? (Like bold, italics, un/ordered lists) What browser are you using?

I don't see any tools; the browser is Opera 9.10 on Xp; thank you

I'm sorry to hear that you're having problems with the editor. I've added a bug report, so that I can follow up on why that might be happening. A short term fix, though, would be to use a different web browser, like Firefox.

that's fine, i am using firefox 3.0.11 and i think it works better since i can see the toolbar you were pointing me to; for example this is an item and this another one thank you !

Would it be possible to add a functionality like "quote" ? Some forums allow to report automatically in a reply some parts of another post a user want to reply to, exactely. In my opinion, it would be useful to understand what one is referring to, and what not. Thank you again.

That looks good...thanks for being willing to experiment! :)

I've added a quote-back feature to my development list. Thanks for the suggestion! K
