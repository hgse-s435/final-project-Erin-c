Hi, I want to do two projects with the kids this week. One is just to pick a backdrop, import a picture and type text.. Merry Christmas or Happy Holidays.. Easy .. BUT when I am done it and save it... There is the green flag right in the middle of the backdrop. Can I get rid of the green flag? Cynthia

When you click the green flag it disappears though :)
