We're looking for teachers who support creativity through computing education or computer science activities to participate in a study about #CreativeComputing! K_12 teachers across the country are engaging in creative computing activities with their students in beautiful and inspiring ways. We love the ways weve seen teachers draw on students creativity and imagination to spark interest in computing. Were looking to connect with educators across the country who are engaging in this type of teaching. Are you one of these teachers? We want to understand more about your creative computing teaching practices, with the ultimate goal of inspiring a broad audience of K_12 educators to support creative computing in their own classrooms.
