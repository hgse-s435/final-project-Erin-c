Hi, Next week at IEEE EDUCON 2015 (Tallinn, Estonia) we are presenting "Computer Programming as an Educational Tool in the English Classroom", a preliminary study in which 2 primary teachers used Scratch to teach English as a second language to 4th and 5th graders in a quasy-experimental design (control and experimental groups, pre and post tests). Here you have the presentation with the main ideas: Slides Best, Jess.

Hi Jess, Congrats on the IEEE submission! Thank you for sharing your slides.How did your presentation go? Sincerely, M

Hi Michelle, Thank you for your comments. I think the presentation went quite well, and I had the opportunity of talking to some other researchers working on similar initiatives, so it was a really interesting conference - although not as fun as last summer Scratch Conference! ;-) Best, Jess.

Glad to hear that the presentation went well!

I did my action research on using graphic organizational tools with ELL students. Now that I am in an area with a larger population of ELL students and using Scratch as a classroom tool, I am interested in doing another research project. I am not currently affiliated with a university or any organization. Do you have any suggestions?
