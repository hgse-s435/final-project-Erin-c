Hey all, I'd like to bring Scratch Education to my national group, but I need someone that is more fluent in Scratch than I that can join me in a 30-45 minute Zoompresentationthis coming Thursday. Is there anyone out there that would help me throw together a quick tutorial to show fellow educators what is possible with Scratch? Does anyone have something already worked up? Thanks in advance, Todd Williver - Oregon State University

What is it that you are trying to put together? What type of examples are you looking for? Age group? Etc. I have given teachers in my school several project ideas with framework to code however due to classroom time constraints sometimes they have a difficult time integrating as fully as they'd like. Let me know the answers to the above and I will try to help with some projects I may have already created. Welcome to Scratch! My Scratch account is: mstone326
