We are planning our Scratch Day event in Lexington on May 14, 2016 from 9:30 am to 12:30pm EST. We would like to have a station at our Scratch Day where students could connect with other students at other Scratch Day events to ask questions or share projects using Google Hangout. If you are hosting a Scratch Day on May 14th and would like to connect with us, please contact Kelly Fischer at kelly.fischer@fayette.kyschools.us. Thanks!
