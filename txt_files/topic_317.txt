Im giving two talks about Scratch (and Alice and some graphics software) at Silicon Valley Code Camp in the beginning of October. This is a free conference. Icould use some volunteers to walk around and help students with Scratch. I usually use my older students for this, but perhaps there are some adult educators in the area who are skilled with Scratch.
