I have an email in to Scratch about this issue, but they indicated that it may take a while to respond. My students have been working on creating games and other presentations to enter into a computer fair for about 2 months now. Yesterday one of my students logged into his account and his project was gone. Instead he saw a list of 17 "projects" that I inferred to be related to the times that he was learning the program and following tutorials. Is there any way to retrieve his project? I am at a loss and the computer fair occurs in a few weeks. Thanks
