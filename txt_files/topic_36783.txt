Hi everyone, Have you been experiencing problems with the Scratch site? Our MIT Scratch Team friends just shared an explanation... Hi Scratchers, As many of you may have noticed, we've been having trouble keeping Scratch running smoothly for the past day. Part of this is due to some updates to Scratch that were made on Wednesday night. In addition, on Thursday morning Scratch experienced a large growth in site traffic due to a number of articles linking to Scratch in the media. While all this attention is great (yay!) we haven't been able to deal with it as well as we would have liked (boo!). Here is what we are doing right now: We have put some small measures into place to help deal with the large influx of traffic We are working on resolving and rolling back some of the changes made on Wednesday night We are working on getting another server into production to help handle the additional load We are very sorry for the trouble that this is causing for many of you and hope to have Scratch back up and running normally soon! Scratch On (soon), - thisandagain (Fromhttps://scratch.mit.edu/discuss/topic/151762/)

Hey everyone, it's Eric from the Scratch Team @ MIT. Thanks for sharing this update, Karen. If anyone has additional questions, please feel free to shoot us a note at "help@scratch.mit.edu"or ask away here. Apologies again, everyone.

As an alternative we also have capacity running Scratch over at Ucodemy on our cloud servers. Its a version of scratch with extra features for the classroom. Try it out here: http://ucodemy.com/itch/
