I am looking for another middle school class to share my 8th Grade classes first attempts at making scratch projects. We are creating animations, storyboards and games showing solutions to real world problems related to technology or to the enviroment.

Are you still looking for a class to partner with? I have three classes of sixth-graders and we rotate every quarter. They would have a blast sharing with your students. Dawn
