The 2013 National Association for Media Literacy Education (NAMLE) Conference is taking place July 12-13 in Torrence, California. The conference theme is Intersections: Teaching and Learning Across Media. Here is an excerpt about the event from the conference website at http://namle.net/conference: Disruption is a watchword for the time we live in: competing social networking platforms, ever-shifting working styles, novel job descriptions displacing the old, manifold curricular and performance demands. With all these possibilities vying for our buy-in, it is vital to seek commonalities. It is at the intersections that we will begin to make sense and make use of a media revolution well underway and yet incompletely understood by our educational infrastructure. This conference will highlight the role of media literacy educators capacity to take a leading role in this nationwide task. Media-savvy educators now have the chance to articulate how new pedagogies can erect road signs at the intersections where communication practices, platforms, and cultures cross paths. Disciplines of thought and method can merge to form innovative perspectives, refreshing the way we approach problems and generating paths of study relevant to 21st Century careers, citizens, relationships and lifestyles. The 2013 NAMLE conference will reflect the reality that education is at a cross roads, with opportunities to push the boundaries in mixing old and new media, as well as combining no-, low-, and high-tech interactions that encourage society to share in the cultural production process of sense and meaning making.
