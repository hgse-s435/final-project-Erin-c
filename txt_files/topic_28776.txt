Hello! I am running an after school enrichment program for the 2nd year at my school in Candia, NH. Actually, I'm running two! I am facilitating one program for grades 3 - 5, and another for grades 6 - 8. My school is holding an open house next week, which will include displays for our after school programs. Could you share your best resources and ideas for introducing and promoting Scratch to students and parents? Thank you! LeeAnn C. Wells
