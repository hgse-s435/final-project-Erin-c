Hi there, I'm organizing a North Bay Scratch Day in San Rafael, CA and was wondering whether there were any other Scratchers or Scratch educators in the area who would like to participate or pool resources. Here is the North Bay Scratch Day page: http://day.scratch.mit.edu/event/366 . It's going to be held in the computer lab of the elementary school where I work. There is also an adjacent conference room where we could demonstrate LEGO, Sensor or Pico board technology. Let me know! If anyone has any advice, I'd appreciate it. Thanks so much. Alfia
