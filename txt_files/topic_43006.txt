A Beginners Guide to Computing + Photography for Teachers: Photo Games and Computer Stories in the K_12 Curriculum July 11 to 15 @ the International Center of Photography, New York City. The workshop is designed for K-12 teachers who want to bring Scratch (or computational thinking more broadly) into their classrooms. It's structured as an introduction to programming forpeople who also like photography  but you don't have to be a "photographer" to join us! Lessons will explore Scratch and digital photography as a way to make interactive collages, games, stories and puzzles. In discussions and reflections we'll ask how learning to program a computer fits in the K-12 curriculum, and share ideas for lesson plans that teachers can adapt to their own classrooms.
