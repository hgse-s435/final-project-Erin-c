I am reading lots of things on the Scratch website about teaching Scratch. However, I need to know the English (not British because Scotland's education system is different again) equivalents for lower elementary,upper elementary etc. Anyone have a list?

Hi Kathryn, I just posted a reply to you but it was mysteriously eaten up ... apologies if this appears more than once! I think KS1 is roughly Lower Elementary and KS2 is Upper Elementary with our English year 6 = Grade 5 and Year 5 = Grade 4 etc. Certainly this is what I found at American schools in Africa. I have been teaching Scratch to year 6 who are very enthusiastic Scratchers: their creativity and very positive attitude to Computing never cease to amaze me. Equally successful have been lessons with year 3 children - Scratch is ageless really. We also have a Code Club - 23 members and a waiting list! Liz (in Sussex)

Hi Liz, thank you for that. I have got my first Code Club on Friday! It will be interesting and cosy - we only have 95 pupils in the whole school so I have got 6 coming. That's probably good for me to start with :) What I lack in experience I hope will be made up for with enthusiasm! Can I give you a shout if I need advice?!

Hi Kathryn, Hope the Club goes well tomorrow ... I look forward to hearing how you get on! I'm not that far from you in Burgess Hill, but I teach in South London (technically I'm not a Code Club Volunteer as it's the sameschool I work in). Liz
