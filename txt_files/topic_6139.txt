SCRATCHCLUBFORELGIN, IL Iam a homeschool mom of two kids trying to connect my kids with other local Scratchers. I would be happy to work with any local organizations, teachers, or other parents to get a local Scratch club off the ground. My son loves Scratch, and has benefitted SOMUCHfrom it. He's not the football, baseball, basketball sort of kid at all. He needs to connect with other kids who love science and technology. If you know of anyone near Elgin, IL (zip 60120) who would like to connect with Scratchers in this area, please have them contact me at ElginScratchers@yahoogroups.com. Thank you.
