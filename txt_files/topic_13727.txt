Hi everyone, Thanks for a fabulous kick-off dinner event tonight -- it was so great to meet all of you! Don't forget to share your About Me interactive collage projects in the Creative Computing 2012 gallery - http://scratch.mit.edu/galleries/view/173859.Here's a quick recap of how to add your project in a gallery: Share your project to the Scratch website. Go to the Creative Computing 2012 gallery and click on "add my project" on the right sidebar. Select the project that you would like to add to the gallery. Click "Accept". If you run into any problems, let us know. See you tomorrow at 8:30! Michelle on behalf of the MIT Creative Computing Team
