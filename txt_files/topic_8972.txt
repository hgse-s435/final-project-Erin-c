I'm wondering how you find each other if you are a class working online in the Scratch community? When I posted my first project, I had comments literally within the hour and it was awesome. My students made their own accounts and are excited to participate in the community but I'd also like them to be leaving comments for each other. I'm thinking of creating a Google Site and listing all of the user pages for the class. Is there a way to create a "group" right in the Scratch community that would do the same thing? How have others accomplished this same goal? Thanks!

Hi Susan, There are two different features of the Scratch website that I've used to connect people in a group to each other: friendsand galleries. With friends, I ask students to add me as a friend, then I add them back. Then, anyone can look at my friends list to see everyone in the class. With galleries, I create a gallery and ask everyone in the class to add their projects to the gallery. That becomes an instant collection of people in the class, where people can then find projects to comment on. Hope that helps, K
