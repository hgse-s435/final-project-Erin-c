We are looking for middle school girls (aged 11-13) in the greater Boston who have previous Scratch experience and would like to spend part of their February vacation creating Scratch games that teach energy conservation. We are a group in at the educational development firm, TERC, composed of experienced science experts and informal educators who have worked with Scratch. Our work focuses on environmental education, particularly around energy use, energy conservation, and climate change behaviors, and builds on previous activities with girl scouts on the same topic. The exact time and days of the week during February vacation week will be determined based on the girls availability and parents schedules. We are expecting that girls will come to TERC for multiple days for around 10 hours total. If you are interested, please contact, Elisabeth Sylvan, at sylvan@terc.edu or response to this thread. We hope to hear from you!
