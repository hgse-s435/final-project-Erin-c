I am in the middle of a unit with my 7th and 8th grade students using scratch to teach control structure. This week about 8 of my 60 students are not able to load their projects. They log in and try to open any project and get stuck with one or two assets short of loading. A few have been able to wait it out after 10 to 15 min. but the rest never load. We have been using scratch off and on for the last 5 weeks with no issue so I am at a loss as to why this is happening. A few things I have tried are... Deleting the browser cache Logging in from other computers Using IE and Chrome We are using windows 7 with IE or Chrome Any help would be greatly appriciated!

Hi David, The MIT Scratch Team has been making updates to the Scratch website in the last few weeks, which might explain the glitches you were experiencing. If it continues, I would recommend contacting them at help@scratch.mit.edu to let them know about the issue. Sincerely, Michelle, on behalf of the ScratchEd Team
