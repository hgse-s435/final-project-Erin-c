Hello, I've had a normal account since three years and I would like to link it to my ed account. Is it possible ? How do I do that ? Thank you

Hi Malik, Scratch and ScratchEd are different sites, with different purposes. This graphic helps explain what's what: Hope that helps, Willa, on behalf of the ScratchEd Team

In this same vein, is there a way to add an existing Scratch account to a teacher account as a student? I have a student who already has a Scratch account with many saved projects and he wants to use this account in our after school coding club rather than starting with a brand new one. Thanks!

Hi Maureen. Thanks for the question. Teacher Accounts can only create new student accounts. It is not currently possible to add existing Scratch accounts to a classroom. As a workaround, you may want to consider following existing Scratchers and have them follow you, your students, and your class studios (existing Scratch accounts can curate class studios as well). This way, you and your students (student accounts as well as existing Scratch accounts) can be aware of each others' activity on the site. I hope this helps!
