Hi Guys, I really could do with some help and ideas here. I have an interview for teaching post in a school. During the interivew I have to teach a class of 12-13 year olds a lesson on scratch, the emphasis being on 'word language'. It can be assumed that the class have no pior knowledge on scratch or programming for that matter. Anybody have any suggestions how I can go about this and also can someone tell me what it means by emphasising the lesson on scratch 'word language'? Much appreciated. Thank you Zpatel

You have been given an impossibly vague and idiotic assigment by someone who probably doesn't know what they are talking about. Good luck with that. Sounds like you just have to use Scratch, not teach them how to use it? I hope so because you don't have enough time to teach "how to" You could demo it but even that takes time, space, etc. Without a clear definition of what "word language" means, it is an exercise in futility. On the other hand, if you have been given this task by someone who is faking Scratch knowledge, it shouldn't be too hard to get creative and come up with something that looks good. I Google "word language" but didn't see anything remotely helpful but only looked at one page of results. Sorry.
