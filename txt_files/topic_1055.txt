Rick reported a super annoying bug yesterday. I know that many of you may have experienced it: you get redirected to a blank page when posting content. I think it's fixed! (It had to do with the notification email settings.) If you see it again (or any other glitchy bits), please don't hesitate to post! Thanks, K

Hi Karen, I just posted from my Mac in Firefox 3.5.3 and experienced the "blank page"problem (twice!) Ingrid

Hmmm -- back to the drawing board! :) Thanks for the report.

I'm still getting it as well.

Does it occur with all types of posting? (E.g. It happens with comments in Discussions as well as posting resources.) Thanks, K

OK -- I've tried something else. Please let me know if you continue to see blank pages... I appreciate the bug reports!!! Thanks, K
