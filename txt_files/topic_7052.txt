Hi Scratch Team, Ijust finished reading "Tinkering Together" - a 2008 paper by Agnes Chang about a proposal for a synchronous collaborative version of Scratch. It kind of blew my mind. Is there any possibility of this becoming a reality? Or even elements from this proposal? Despite the road blocks Chang mentions, it still seems like an amazing idea. curious and excited, PeterR ----------

Agnes is great -- and put together a nice proposal for Mitch's course. It's not clear at the moment how her ideas will influence the future of Scratch. But if there were elements you found particularly interesting, I encourage you to post them to Scratch Suggestions athttp://info.scratch.mit.edu/Suggestions
