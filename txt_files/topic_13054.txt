Hi all My name is Orad Weisberg, third year studentfor interactive communication at IDC Israel. I am doing a research on Scratched community (thats you) and I need your help with the research. All you need to do is go to the link below and fill quick questionnaire regarding your activities in the Scratched community. This will not take more than 2 minutes and it will be very helpful for me. If you want more details feel free to comment this post with any question you have Many thanks Orad Link to the questionnaire: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dDItdFgyY0hjQmtyRjFHYnFLcHBna2c6MQ#gid=0
