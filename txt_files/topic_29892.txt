Hello, I'm a year 4 class teacher who has struggled to download sample projects saved as *.sb but seem unable to locate such files. Even those titled as being created in Scratch 1.3 seem to have the *.sb2 Maybe I'm looking in the wrong places. Can anyone advise on where such Scratch 1.3 projects can be found, please?
