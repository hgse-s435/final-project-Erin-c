We had great sessions at the December Scratch Educator Meetup! I am sharing this GoogleDoc, and asking participants to: 1.) Add your name to the list of participants. 2.) Add any notes, links or projects that you have that are not included in the document. https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MPgGi496zs9QazoIgi95ipyn7JbXP1VzYXsbHQkc1EY/edit?usp=sharing Thank you for your help! ScratchTeam, I'll see you in February! LeeAnn C. Wells
