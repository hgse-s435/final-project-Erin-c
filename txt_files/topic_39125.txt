MIT, Harvard, Transforming Ed and Boston Collegiate Charter School are partnering closely this Spring to research how to boost important student outcomes. As a part of this project, were looking to hire TWOScratchinstructors for two 6thgrade classrooms. No technical experience is necessarythere is a pre-written curriculum and there will be trainingthough some prior teaching experience is preferred. The program will begin onFebruary 23rdand run for about 8 weeks, excluding holidays. We need individuals who are excited for this paid opportunity to commit to Tuesdays through Fridays from2:15-3:15pm. The school is directly across from the JFK Stop on the MBTAs red line. This is a greatPAIDposition for a grad student or an individual with a flexible schedule who wants an opportunity to be in the classroom and work with a wonderful school.
