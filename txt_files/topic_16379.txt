I enjoyed not just Scratch info, but the discussion of current education techniques. It still says there are monthly webinars, but I don't see any since summer 2012. Are there monthly webinars or not? Thanks, Carolyn

Hi Carolyn, Thanks for your message -- and for pointing out this much-needed update! We're in the process of updating our online offerings. (Stay tuned for some exciting announcements later this week.) Although we're not currently hosting webinars, recordings of our previous monthly webinars are available online. Sincerely, K

Enjoyed the past webinars and the format with seeing chat questions even after the fact. Or I would not have asked. Thanks
