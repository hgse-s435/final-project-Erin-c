Hi, I'd like to invite you to control a Model Train over the internet with Scratch (version 1.4). You can control the Model Train with Scratch's Join Mesh feature and results are observed on a web cam. When nobody else controls the Model at that moment, you can obtain 20-minutes exclusive timeslot (locked to your public IP) and compose your projects or load & run some predefined ones. Further details: www.flyfish-tech.com/scratch/ This Model Train has been implemented as a proof of concept and will be available to you for few months. Best wishes, Ivan Zilic FLYFISH TECHNOLOGIES d.o.o.
