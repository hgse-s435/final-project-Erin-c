We've just released the Scratch tours -- http://info.scratch.mit.edu/Scratch_Tours -- guided collections of Scratch projects. We would love to get your feedback on the existing tours and ideas for future tours. Thanks! K

What a great idea! For future collections, how about two sets with a "Scratch in schools" focus, one for younger and one for older grades?

I've got a draft of "Scratch in Schools" already started -- including work from your group. :) If you have particular favorites, please let me know. I'd be happy to include them! Thanks, K

Oh ho, now I am curious as to which ones you've noted. If I can find Keenan's old Ben Franklin project, I like that for how he combined a book report with games to play. Thinking about projects from schools, there's also the difference between projects made by kids exploring ideas and projects made to demonstrate specific curriculum concepts.
