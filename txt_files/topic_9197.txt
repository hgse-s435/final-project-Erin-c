Hi Karen, Thanks so much for inviting me to speak at the webinar. It was a nice collaborative experience to exchange information with people from around the world! I've just created an event for World Museum in the Scratch Day website. http://day.scratch.mit.edu/event/358 We are still setting up the website for World Museum, but it will be up soon and I hope many people will be joining this collaborative project! The webinar was my first experience of adobe connect, but I liked the general format. I think this webinar was for the general audience, but I thought that it might be interesting to have more informal meetings organized by people with some more specific interests. Just a thought. Anyway, I look forward to more collaboration! Yoshiro Miyata
