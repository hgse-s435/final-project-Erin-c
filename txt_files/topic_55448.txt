Calling all K-2nd educators! The DevTech Research Group at Tufts University (co-developers of ScratchJr) is conducting a research study on how children ages 5-7 and their family members can create projects together using the free ScratchJr app. These 1-2 hour ScratchJr Family Day events can be hosted in museums, schools, after school programs - anywhere that families can come together! Sign up to host a ScratchJr Family Day this spring and receive free step-by-step instructions and a consultation with the ScratchJr team. The research portion of the event consists of completing a few short surveys. Learn more about our Family Coding Days research, and sign up to host a ScratchJr Family Day by June 8th, 2018!
