Hi everyone, Just to let you know that our new MOOC, "Code Yourself! An Introduction to Programming", has now begun, and is available on Coursera: https://www.coursera.org/course/codeyourself This is a free online course that teaches young teenagers how to program using Scratch. Teachers are welcome to join the course and reuse some of the materials in their own teaching. This course is offered by the University of Edinburgh and the ORT University in Uruguay, and a Spanish-speaking equivalent of this course, called A Programar!, is also currently available. Hope to see you on the course! Areti
