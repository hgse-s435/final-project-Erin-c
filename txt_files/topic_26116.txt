The MIT StarLogo team will be introducing teachers to their new web-based game and simulation design tool, StarLogo Nova, following the April ScratchEd Meetup. Come hear what other educators are doing with StarLogo and then follow along through a brief tutorial. The Meetup will be held in the MIT STEP lab, 3rd floor of the Weisner Building (next door to the MIT Media Lab). I will be attending the ScratchEd Meetup and will act as pied piper, leading folks over once you've finished your lunch. Please register on Eventbrite so we don't run out of yummy snacks. We look forward to seeing you!
