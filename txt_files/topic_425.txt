Thinking about the couple postings asking for more ordered collections of math and physics projects has me wondering about how this can happen in ScratchEd. I put together a collection of map projects (gallery maps and Scratch, http://scratch.mit.edu/galleries/view/53737) but finding them felt a lot like hunt and peck typing. It sounds like having searchable collections of curriculum-related projects would be helpful to educators. Entering a project at a time here in ScratchEd would be a pain. Any other ideas for ways to use or modify the structure to meet this need? Karen R.
