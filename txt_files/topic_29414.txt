Hi, it seems I stopped receiveing updates about the discussion on scratched in a while. I checked back and it seems all my subscriptions are active. How can I do to fix it? Thank you very much!

Hi Robert, We recently updated the ScratchEd website, and somehow, subscriptions were turned off. We are working on fixing the bug. Thanks for letting us know. Sincerely, Michelle. on behalf of the ScratchEd Team
