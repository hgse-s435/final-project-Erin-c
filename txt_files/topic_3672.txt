Hello Scratch Community! My organization, MOUSE (www.mouse.org), has a team of 4 amazing high school students who want to prototype a video game they've been designing - called "immigration-ville"(see the link at the bottom of this post for their prototype video). We'd like to hire a Scratch-pro ASAP to coach them on the tech-basics of simple video game design. S/he must be available to meet with the students for at least 3 two-hour lessons, after school from 4:30 - 6:30pm, between May and June 15th. Compensation will be $35/hr for 7 hours minimum. Please email me at meredith@mouse.org if you are interested. Job & project description here (with a video from the students!): http://www.mousesquad.org/hiring Please forward to anyone you think might be available!

Hi Meredith, I hope you got some replies to this. There are several great Scratch educators in the NYC area! Thanks, K
