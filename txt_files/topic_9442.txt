Hi there, I'm trying to find a place where I can purchase 2 or 3 Picoboards that will work with Scratch. Sparkfun is all out and I can only find one available, and it's in the U.K. If anyone knows of anywhere I can purchase some (gently used ok too), please let me know the details. Thanks!

Hi Alfia, Unfortunately, Sparkfun is the only place that I know of... K

Hi Karen, I contacted them directly and they said they should have some in next month. :-) There are several other places to get them online, but they're all out of the U.S. Alfia
