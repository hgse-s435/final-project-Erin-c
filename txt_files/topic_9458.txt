I would like to do a breakout session around assessment. Thinking about questions like:How do you assess your students' projects?How do you identify what areas they could improve upon or where they need to be challenged more?How do you assess your own Scratch activities? Anyone interested? Looking forward to the Meetup!

I would like to do a breakout session around building games in Scratch. I'd also be interested in meeting other people from high schools using Scratch in school or out of school.

I am also (Ricarose) interested in learning how to look at a Scratch project and take the student to the next level - whatever is right for that person... I know this is not a simple process...
