Dear ScratchEd Community, Hello! My name is Willa and I'm the new Creative Computing project manager at the Harvard Graduate School of Education. I can't wait to get to know your amazing community of educators, both online and face-to-face! As we head back to school, what are your Scratch plans? (Post them here or share on twitter)!
