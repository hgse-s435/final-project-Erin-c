This summer, CS2N is hosting online competitions. From animation to game design, we are offering several outlets for students, educators, and hobbyists to hone their creative abilities and computer science skills. We also provide tutorials/training materials to support the software participants will use. With the "Of Mice and Monsters!" animation competition, partipants are asked to bring life to an adorable little bunny or pony by animating it to hop around a field. Or if cute isn't their thing, they may animate a mummy or dinosaur as it roars angrily in the desert. They can create a character from scratch or use one already created. Learn more here!
