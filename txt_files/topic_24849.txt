Our third grade students remixed our school song and uploaded them into a Scratch project modeled after the artistic style of Knuffle Bunny. Knuffle Bunny's artwork consists of cartoon images over black-and-white photographs. We chose this children's book because it is a Caldecott Award winner, and it fit into the third grade Caldecott unit. This was the first time many of our students used Scratch, and they all picked up on it very well! I designed a tiger for them to use with the program because our school mascot is a tiger, and the book centers around a stuffed animal bunny. We simply switched out the bunny for our tiger (3 Costumes) and the images in the book for photos of our campus.
