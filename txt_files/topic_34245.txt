I am happy to announce my new book is now available in most Barnes&Noble locations, on Amazon.com and in select independent bookstores. It is also available in ebook format for Kindle, Nook, and Google Play. This is one of the few books which emphasizes Scratch design techniques, though kids will gradually expand their programming skills as well. Find out more from the publisher's website.
