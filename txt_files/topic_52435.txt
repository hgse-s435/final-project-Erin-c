I created 'Classes' for the first time in 2016. Those students have now moved up a grade. Can they still log in with their usernames from last year? If I delete a class, what happens to those user accounts? Can they still login? Those students are now in different class configurations. Can I move students between existing classes? Can I rename the classes? Can I hand the 'Class' off to another teacher? Thanks
