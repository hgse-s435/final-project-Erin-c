I just realized that I have probably missed the fall webinars and am looking to see if there is a November webinar. We're busy with Scratch again and I need to get back into the support loop! :)

Hi Susan, Our next webinar is on November 30 (seehttp://scratched.eventbrite.com/ for more information). Recording of previous webinars are available on ScratchEd athttp://scratched.media.mit.edu/search/node/webinar%20type%3Aresource Hope to see you at the next webinar!
