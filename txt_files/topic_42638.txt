Hi Everyone I am a Fine Arts/Programming and Web Development Instructor. I have several students with moderate special needs in my PWD class and need to know if anyone out there deals with teaching this subject with these particular students. I would like someone to share their curriculum with me so that I may get an idea of how to start teaching this to them. This (Programming)is all new to me and I am working on my certificate towards it. I am an "old pro" at web design/development but need more classes in order to get certified in Programming. Any suggestions? Sincerely, Robin Monaco Fine Arts/Programming/Web Development Instructor
