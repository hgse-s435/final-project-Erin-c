hello, i will use scratch in the next school year and i'd like to choose carefully the resource to get people introduced to the tool; i feel very comfortable with learnscratch.org even because they send a dvd for free to use in the lab and that resource is very low-floor to high-ceiling are you aware of other similar documents? they should have a comparable wide approach, not necessarily tailored to one specific topic; especially if they can be used off-line (books or dvd's) since i haven't internet connection easily at school thank you in advance

We have a (less comprehensive) offering at scratch.redware.com which is being used in some primary schools here in Sussex, UK. There is a lesson plan with videos and resources and you can download the website (well an older version) from redware.4shared.com.

Hi Roberto That's the best website I have ever seen, the best reference, the reference. Every body should have to study seriously and closely. First : the class management is remarkable Second : the step by step approach of Scratch is made with a very clever manner. ( Difficult for me to write in english) You are right
