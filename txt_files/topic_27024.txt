Comment from Nancy: - computers don't necessarily have speakers Suggestion for Barbara: - using webcam with game making (e.g. Fruit Ninja, balloon game)

I created a demo project for a music teacher friend using the built-in synthesizer to not only play notes from various instruments when characters are clicked, but even using a bit of code and basic music theory to improvise music in the same key.
