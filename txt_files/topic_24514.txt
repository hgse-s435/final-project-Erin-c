Hi ScratchEd! In collaboration with researchers at EDC/CCT, we've been developing portraits of teachers working with Scratch in the classroom. The 1-page portraits present a context in which Scratch is being used and a pedagogical puzzle that the teacher is working on. We'd love to get feedback from you on the content and the structure of the portraits. A sample portrait is available at https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5-lw7R420OCY1NFMVZPaHhEVjA/edit?usp=sharing Two questions: What suggestions would you share with the teacher in the profile? How can we improve the portrait structure/format? Thanks so much! Karen

I would like to see the geographic location of the teacher. After reading the portrait Iwas thinking I wish there was a way to get in touch with her to discuss her concerns and/or collaborate. So having a place to note how to contact the teacher is important.

Thanks, Karen!
