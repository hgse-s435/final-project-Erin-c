The LA Makerspace (lamakerspace.com) and Cal State Northridge are teaming up on a project to recruit teens and tweens to run intro to Scratch classes for yonger kids. We tried this out last spring with a workshop run in part by girls from The Archer School. That worked so well we want to expand the project into something called the LA Makerspace Scratch Squad (LAMSS). You can learn more about LAMSS on the website http://www.lamakerspace.com/scratchsquad We are looking to spread the word among Scratch teachers in Los Angeles and also let the community know what we are doing in case people what to try this in other cities. We will be training the teens this fall/winter and doind classes all spring. I will try to post updates on how the project goes. Let us know what you think!
