Coming to Cambridge for the Scratch Conference next month? The StarLogo Nova team is offering an introductory workshop at MIT on Wednesday, August 6th (the day before the conference) from 9am to 3pm. The $25 registration fee covers breakfast, lunch and all materials. ScratchEd members can get an additional 20% off by using this discount code when you register on Eventbrite:SCRATCH-ED Workshop Description In this fun, intensive, hands-on workshop, participants will learn how to program 3D games and science simulation models using StarLogo Nova, an online educational software tool which uses the same block-based programming approach as Scratch. If you have never programmed before, this workshop will be a great introduction. For people with prior programming experience, this workshop will provide you with experience in an easy-to-use, powerful programming tool to add to your repertoire. We will organize participants by experience level so that you will work with others with similar levels of experience and be able to move through the activities at a pace you're comfortable with. A team of facilitators will be able to answer any questions and will help to make sure the entire workshop is fun and valuable for all participants. Find out more about the workshop and register on Eventbrite. For a more extensive StarLogo Nova training experience, check out the week-long Imagination Toolbox Workshop being offered at MIT the week after the Scratch Conference.

If you cannot make it to the StarLogo workshop be sure to look for our poster presentation, Imagine Scratch In 3D, at the Scratch Conference on Friday, August 8 at 4:30 pm.

Hi Derek I saw some cards you had during the conference with what looked like 'tips' for starlogo. Are those available either on site or for purchase?
