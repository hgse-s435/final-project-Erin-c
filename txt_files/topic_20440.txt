This discussion is primarily for topics expored during the August 25th UCCI Scratch workshop but I encourage folks to use it beyond this week. For questions I cannot answer I will do my best to engage the appropriate expert in the Media Lab.

Do you have any questions abour registering for yourScratch and ScratchEd accounts?

What Scratch features are you most curious about/desire to focus on?

What are you having difficulty with in Scratch?
