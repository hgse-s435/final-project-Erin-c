A colleague and I would like to attend a Scratch workshop in Califorina this year (2015)? Please advise of any opportunities. Thanks!

Hi Lisa, I know that Brian Foley at CSUN runs workshops in the Los Angeles areaand at LA Makerspace. You might want to contact him about upcoming workshops or if he knows of other PD opportunities happening near you. I hope that helps. I'll let you know if I hear of any upcoming Bay area Scratch workshops. Sincerely, Michelle, on behalf of the ScratchEd Team
