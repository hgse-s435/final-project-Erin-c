What did you use to make the videos? I found them clear and easy to follow. Thank you for sharing.

Hi Patrice, Thank you for your feedback. I used the screen capturing software Screenflow on a MacBook. Overall I was very satisfied with this software and Irecommend it. If you have more questions about the production process Iwould be happy to answer. -Robyn

Hi Robyn, Thanks for the information. UnfortunatelyI do not have MacBooks at my school. Do you know of any screen capturing software for the PC? -Patrice

Hi Patrice, Do you know if your school has screen capturing software for PC. Iknow of Camtasia - which looks like you can do a lot on the PC platform (not so great on Mac). If your school doesn't have the software, I think good screencapturing cost a bit of $. If you want to continue this conversation you can email me rdby735@mail.harvard.edu. I am happy to help you figure something out. -Robyn
