I recently posted about the Camera I'm kickstarting (only 6 days left!)https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/robosnap/robosnap-vision-for-your-robot When demoing this at the San Mateo Maker Faire a few weeks ago, I got a lot of excitement from kids that saw my computer running Snap! - they would say - "Hey that's Scratch - I know Scratch". I think applying Snap!/Scratch to Robotics is a great next step. I currently have a Kickstarter reward just for running Snap! on an EV3 without the camera. It controls the motors and LEGO sensors. If you think this is interesting then please help support my Kickstarter or sign up for our newsletter at www.robosnap.net. I'm planning on developing a curriculum for teachers to teach LEGO Robotics with Snap! Would love to know whether this is of interest - please give me some feedback.
