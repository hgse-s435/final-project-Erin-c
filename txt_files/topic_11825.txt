Hi everyone looking for some help/advice. I am researching Games-based learning through the use of game making in class for my PhD. At present I work with classes of children Primary 4 to primary 7 (ages 8-12). I work for around 8 hours with them over 8 weeks to develop a game, however while not part of what im trying to research I would like to know if anyone has assessed any game making with their class. What I'm looking to see is has anyone developed any methods of assessing what the children have made for their game i.e does it have sprites, backgrounds, scripts. Or even if anyone could offer advice it would be a help as this would posibly help strengthen the research already being done.
