I have a Games Design course for HS students, and I have a vision of having all 12 kids sitting at computers in our school network, writing games in Scratch. Then, at the end of the period, they upload their games to a gallery I have created called 'HKISgamers', where we can all access them and play each other's creations that night from our homes. But here's the rub. 1) I have created the gallery, made it public access, but how do I get my kids to be able to find it to contribute their work? There is no 'search galleries' function. 2) If three or four kids all try to log on to their Scratch accounts from different computers in our network, they end up being logged into someone else's account instead. Apparently, I cant have multiple users from a single network on line simultaneously. 3) When someone tries to upload their game, the screen goes dark and they are told that they are trying to do an impossible task and told to restart. I have a sneaking feeling that this is related to #2. How do I achieve my vision of having a common, findable gallery where the kids can deposit their work while in school? M

Hi Myron, I answered this in a different thread, but I'll repeat and extend here. :) 1) I have created the gallery, made it public access, but how do I get my kids to be able to find it to contribute their work? There is no 'search galleries' function. The Scratch search (located at the top of the page, to the right) can be used to search for galleries. For example, I'm a teaching assistant for a course this term. I set up a gallery that I namedMAS.714 2009. The participants can search forMAS.714 2009and filter or refine the results to include onlygalleries. (The options are for refining byusers,forums,projects,galleries, ordocumentation.) 2) If three or four kids all try to log on to their Scratch accounts from different computers in our network, they end up being logged into someone else's account instead. Apparently, I cant have multiple users from a single network on line simultaneously. That's really bizarre! You definitely should be able to have multiple users from a single network on Scratch simultaneously. We do it fairly regularly in our research group -- and I've done it in schools. Maybe you could try some controlled tests (one person on, add another person, etc.) to see where things are getting funky? 3) When someone tries to upload their game, the screen goes dark and they are told that they are trying to do an impossible task and told to restart. I have a sneaking feeling that this is related to #2. Wow -- that's also really strange! Could you give me a bit more information about what version of Scratch you're running and in what type of configuration (type of machines, OS, etc.)? How do I achieve my vision of having a common, findable gallery where the kids can deposit their work while in school? Hopefully, that was answered by 1. But please don't hesitate to let me know if things aren't working or if you have other questions!

Hi Karen: nice to hear from you. I'll thread my responses in allcaps. 1) I have created the gallery, made it public access, but how do I get my kids to be able to find it to contribute their work? There is no 'search galleries' function. The Scratch search (located at the top of the page, to the right) can be used to search for galleries. For example, I'm a teaching assistant for a course this term. I set up a gallery that I namedMAS.714 2009. The participants can search forMAS.714 2009and filter or refine the results to include onlygalleries. (The options are for refining byusers,forums,projects,galleries, ordocumentation.) HMMM, THE SEARCH FUNCTION I SEE DOESN'T HAVE ANY REFINEMENT OPTIONS. I HAVE THE BLUE FRAMED SEARCH BOX, AND THE 'SEARCH' COMMAND ONLY. BUT NONETHELESS, TODAY IT FINDS THE GALLERY. POSSIBLY THE PROBLEM YESTERDAY WAS THAT IT WAS AN EMPTY GALLERY, OR THAT IT WAS NEWLY CREATED? 2) If three or four kids all try to log on to their Scratch accounts from different computers in our network, they end up being logged into someone else's account instead. Apparently, I cant have multiple users from a single network on line simultaneously. That's really bizarre!

Maybe you could try some controlled tests (one person on, add another person, etc.) to see where things are getting funky? I'LL TRY THAT ON MONDAY. 3) When someone tries to upload their game, the screen goes dark and they are told that they are trying to do an impossible task and told to restart. I have a sneaking feeling that this is related to #2. Wow -- that's also really strange! Could you give me a bit more information about what version of Scratch you're running and in what type of configuration (type of machines, OS, etc.)? YES, THIS IS THE MOST BIZARRE ONE AND THE ONE THAT I NEED TO TROUBLESHOOT THE MOST; OTHERWISE THE KIDS HAVE TO DO THEIR UPLOADING FROM HOME. I'M RUNNINGTHE LATEST VERSION OF SCRATCH (V. 1.4) ON iMACS RUNNING OSX. NOT ONE KID OUT OF 12 WAS ABLE TO UPLOAD FROM SCHOOL, BUT SO FAR 5 OF THEM HAVE UPLOADED FROM HOME. WHENITHAPPENSAGAIN, I'LL SNAG A SCREENSHOT. SOMETHING IS DEFINITELY WEIRD HERE. THANKS, Myron

POSSIBLY THE PROBLEM YESTERDAY WAS THAT IT WAS AN EMPTY GALLERY, OR THAT IT WAS NEWLY CREATED? Yes, it takes time for Google to pick up new content, so there's a bit of a delay. The refinement options appear at the top of the search results list page. Here's a picture. Good luck with the testing! K

You might try giving your class the direct link to the gallery: http://scratch.mit.edu/galleries/view/58598 This would eliminate the need to wait for googl. I've found that it's very useful to have a class webpage that provides direct links to projects, galleries, forums, assignments and how-to videos that I want students to visit. Posting the in the room or providing them as handouts can also work but expect to be plagued by typos. Once they have accessed the gallery, instruct them to bookmark it like this: http://scratch.mit.edu/galleries/view/58598 2) If three or four kids all try to log on to their Scratch accounts from different computers in our network, they end up being logged into someone else's account instead. Apparently, I cant have multiple users from a single network on line simultaneously Could this be an issue of students not logging out of the Scratch site when they are finished?
