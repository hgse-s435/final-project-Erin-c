How do I have my students attach their projects to our class studio?

Hi Donna! Here is a description from the Scratch discussion boards as to how this works. I'd also recommendjoining the Teaching with Scratch Facebook Groupwhere educators are actively sharing best practices and questions! I hope this helps :). Best, Alexa

Thank you so much. We have it going now.
