--just thinking about how new college students start a Facebook page to get to know each other a little before school and wondering - if you're staying in the dorm for the conference and would like to introduce yourself here... I'm Susan and I'm coming with 7 high school students (and one Mom chaparone) - 4 boys and 3 girls. We're in the dorm Wednesday night through Friday night.

I'm Kim and I'm coming with my son (rising 9th grader). Good to learn other HS students will be there. Hope it won't be too hot in the dorms without AC!

I'm Matt. Staying in the dorms Wednesday night through Saturday morning.

Hi Matt and Kim - we're thinking of looking around the lobby of the dorm at 4:45 on Wednesday to see who's around for supper - look forward to connecting!

Hi, I'm Joe and I'm staying in Baker House Wed - Sat morning.
