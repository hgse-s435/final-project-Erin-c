May Webinar: Computational Thinking Perspectives Monday, May 23, 2011 7pm-8pm EST Hosted by Mitch Resnick and Karen Brennan Scratch supports the cultivation of computational thinking, a set of concepts, practices, and perspectives that draw on ideas from the world of computing. In the past few years, there has been a growing recognition of the importance of computational thinking for understanding and solving problems in a wide range of contexts, not only in the field of computer science. As young people program and share Scratch projects, they begin to develop as computational thinkers: they learn core computational and mathematical concepts, while also learning important strategies for designing, problem solving, and collaborating. In the third of three webinars focused on computational thinking, we will focus on computational thinking perspectives: expressing, connecting, and questioning. All webinars will be recorded and shared on ScratchEd. Join us online athttp://connectpro53415882.adobeconnect.com/may2011/
