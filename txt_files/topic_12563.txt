From the Scratch Team blog: Scratch 2.0 is a collaboration, with different people working on different parts of the same project. Most of the Scratch Team's time and effort is spent thinking carefully about how to make Scratch 2.0 easy and intuitive for people who are new to programming. Developers help turn those ideas into working code. The movie below is a visualization that shows how one part of Scratch 2.0 - the website code - has grown and changed as we work on it. Each dot represents a file that's part of Scratch 2.0. The figures that dart in and out, making changes to existing files and adding new ones, are the developers. As you'll see, Champika Fernando, the lead developer of the Scratch 2.0 website, has changed a lot of files, along with John Maloney and Sayamindu Dasgupta. And of course, the entire Scratch Team has been thinking carefully about the design of things (something which this visualization does not show). Lots of Scratchers have been asking us when Scratch 2.0 will be ready. It's still too soon to name an exact date, but we're planning to launch Scratch 2.0 later this year. As soon as we have a timetable for release, well post an announcement.
