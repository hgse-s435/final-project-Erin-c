We thought you'd like to know that Animation14 - the 7th Annual UK Schools Computer Animation Competition, has launched! It's open now, for teacher registration, atanimation.cs.manchester.ac.uk Animation14 is a free-to-enter, not-for-profit competition run by The University of Manchester, designed to enthuse young people about Computer Science. The competition is open to all UK schoolchildren aged 7-19. Teacher registration is free and carries no obligation to submit any entries. All registered teachers will receive free colour A2 Animation13 posters for their school, to be sent out in October. Entrants can create their animations (maximum duration: 1 minute) using any of the following programs: Scratch, Alice, Adobe Flash, Serif: Draw Plus, KoolMoves, SWiSH Max4, Blender, Autodsk 3DS Max and Maya. There are great prizes, awarded at the Animation Festival and Inspirational Computer Science Day held at The University of Manchester on 11 July 2014. Last years Animation13 competition was bigger than ever, with over 1,120 entries from 154 schools across the UK. We awarded prizes to 41 students (working as individuals, or in groups) from 24 schools. You can see all the winning entries, and photos from our Awards and Inspirational Computer Science Day atanimation.cs.manchester.ac.uk.
