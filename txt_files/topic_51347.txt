I am looking to hire Scratch educators to teach in the Marble Hill neighborhood of the Bronx, NY. This is a paid opportunity with Generation Code - an exciting, young, start-up in the NY area. This is a summer opportunity beginning at the end of July and we are looking to get some new instructors in our pipeline ASAP. If interested, please email debra.feinberg@generationcode.com
