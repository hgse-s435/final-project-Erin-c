Hi, I have a student for whom I cannot change a password.  I've tried both ways: by prompting and by manually changing. In both cases, I get kicked into the "captcha" screen, and typing password and captcha never works to get me past this point. For some reason, his account only works on a single computer, which at the moment is not working. It's very strange. I tried clearing all browser data, but that didn't seem to work either. Any ideas of what to do? The student is 1/2 way through a project, so creating a new account isn't really an option. And he hasn't shared it yet, so I can't access it to download as an .sb2 file. Thanks for any help with this. Richard Smyth rsmyth@stonehamschools.org
