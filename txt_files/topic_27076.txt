I am creating a game for my year 12 Industrial Technology Multimedia major and the resolution of the images is not that great. I wanted to know if there is anyway I can make the images/sprites resolution look better on scratch?

It might be that you are using the image editor in bitmap mode. On the bottom-right, make sure that "Vector Mode" is clicked. Hope that helps! M
