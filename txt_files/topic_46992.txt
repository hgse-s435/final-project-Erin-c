Hi Everyone! I am interested in facilitating a Scratch Educator Meetup in South Florida! Looking for educators interested in participating! If you are, please email some possible dates in March: alexis.cobo@pinecrest.edu or tweet me: @agatorbites ! I have some ideas for a location, but open to any place, time, or day! Looking forward to connect, Alexis

That would be a great idea! Sorry I didn't see this until today.
