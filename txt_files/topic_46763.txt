Hi all, I am looking for a resource that I used last year...not sure where I found it, honestly. It identified standards in the common core that are addressed through teaching Scratch to primary (2/3 grade) students. Has anyone seen something like this? Wracking my brain! Thank you!

Thanks so much! This is a great start.
