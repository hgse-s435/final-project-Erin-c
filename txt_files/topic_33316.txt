My students all have gmail accounts, howerver these accounts are locked down so they don't receive any emails from outside of the district. This serves as a difficult situation for me because I want my students to be able to embed their projects on their district webpage. Is there a way for them to have access to the embedding code without having to verify/confirm an email account?

As far as I know, the Scratch Team is working on Educators Accounts that would solve the problem you have but a solution could be... 1. Ask your students to download their projects 2. You, as a teacher, upload the projects in a "school" studio. 3. Share the studio link in your district webpage Frank

To add to Frank's answer... I've received several questions about this, which I've forwarded to the MIT Scratch Team.Here's how they responded: We suggest using a single email address (e.g., your own) to approve all of your student accounts. (Multiple Scratch accounts can share the same address.) We realize that the confirmation process can be time-consuming for you and other educators, but confirmation is just a one-time process when first registering an account. We're currently developing Scratch educator accounts which will streamline the process of student account creation and management. We hope to launch a beta version this coming summer. Hope that helps... K
