The organizers of the 10th global Scratch conference, this summer in Bordeaux, France, are preparing a book to celebrate 10 years of Scratch. We invite you to contribute one of your best Scratch memories for inclusion in a book celebrating 10 years of Scratch. May be as short as a sentence or long as you wish. In any language understood by Scratch Cat! All stories will be published online, while a diverse selection will be presented as a printed book at Scratch2017BDX.? http://www.scratch2017bdx.org/en/scratch10book/ has the form which should be used before June 15 (!).
