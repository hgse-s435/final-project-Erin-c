Can anyone tell me please why I cannot get on to Dr Scratch Regards Cath

Hi Cath! It looks like it's back up now. It may have been down for maintenance! Best, Alexa

Does Dr Scratch work with Scratch 3.0? Apparentrly not, am I missing something? Thanks

Hi Laura, It does appear to be down at the moment. It looks like they have a beta version for Scratch 3, but perhaps they are still working some parts out? I'd suggest contacting their team at:team@drscratch.org to see what's going on! Best, Alexa
