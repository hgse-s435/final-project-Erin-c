Does anyone have any ideas for creating original assets for students for Scratch games? I can teach Photoshop, but I am wondering about using Pixlr or Gravit. Any lesson plans you can share?

Hi Arthur! Thanks for your question. One great option is to have students generate original assets in the Scratch Paint Editor. Here, a young person demonstrates step-by-step how they have created a character from scratch (no pun intended) in the editor. As we are undergoing a transition time in the ScratchEd Online Community, I think you may also get some great responses if you continue to postthese questions in the Teaching with Scratch Facebook Group. Best, Alexa, on behalf of the ScratchEd Team
