Hi everyone I was just wondering if a teachergives some type of brain break for students to re-energize theirbrains. I will be teaching for 4 hours straight. I think some type of brain break from the computer would be necessary. I am looking forward to teaching Scratch. I found CSfirst.withgoogle.com for about 8 lessons of game design to get them going. After that, I will let them build theirown game in pairs. Has anyone tried CS firstwith Google?
