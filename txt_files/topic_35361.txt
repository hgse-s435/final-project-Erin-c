Hello everyone I'm trying to find images of the scratch blocks that I can print to make manipulatives that kids can use to plan and think before actually going to the computer. Does anyone know where I can get high quality printable images of ALL the scratch blocks? I already have the printable blocks for scratch JR and want to do the same thing with Scratch 2.0 blocks. Thanks!!!

Here's a post where another ScratchEd member created different printable versions of most of the blocks:http://scratched.gse.harvard.edu/resources/vector-scratch-blocks

Thanks for sharing this post!
