I'll be teaching Scratch at Spirit of Knowledge Charter School in Worcester this fall. I guarantee that games will be part of it. I'll have the kids post their results to the Scratch website.

I definitely will be using games when I re-write my introduction to programming unit. I think creating a game will be the culminating project. I think most students will really enjoy that type of project and it allows for so much creativity.

I like this. I am wondering if there are any ways in scratch to create games where you can have more than one player. This would be really appealing as well.

Creating Scratch games is so much fun that I am almost worried that once I introduce this in my classes, the kids may not want to work with other applications!!!
