I'm looking for others using Leap Motion with Scratch for collaboration and troubleshooting. For now, here is one issue: This is a drawing project with a finger and Leap Motion. We are using the offline Scratch 2.0 editor. It draws and draws and then all of a sudden, it starts making sharp straight lines when you move the finger instead of what the finger is doing. We are baffled. Has anyone else had a similar experience? One of my students figured out that a hand keeps a connection with the Leap Motion better than a finger but in another game being built, two fingers work to move two characters in a game but two hands cause confusion as they overlap too easily.
