Hi everyone! I have just recently started using Scratch. I would like to know if anybody has any ideas on a good way to use scratch for a fifth grader who struggles with reading. Any ideas or suggestions would be helpful. Thank you!

Hello Jessica, Say a little more about the context for your Scratch work with this student. Is this part of a Scratch class and he/she is having trouble reading the scripts, or are you tutoring and looking for ways Scratch can turn him/her on to reading? If the latter, some of the story-telling projects might be fun to try. For example, have the student take some photos around school, make a Scratch slide show that is just a sprite switching costumes (the imported photos), then record narration about what the photos say about the school as a special place. Link that to reading a picture book about special places such as A Quiet Place by Douglas Woods or When I was Young in the Mountains by C. Rylant. If you're thinking more about using Scratch as a way to practice specific skills, how about having the student make a flash card game that features the sight words he/she most needs to memorize? The words appear on the screen (sprite costumes again), pause for reading, then have a voice recording that says the word for the student to check. Or, if none of this fits, keep asking! Karen R.

Iam tutoring her andlooking forideas to turn her on to reading. Shejust began using Scratchand likes paying attention to the details for the finished product so I am hoping that her interest with it will give her that little extra boost in motivation with reading that she needs. I will try out your idea though. I think she would enjoy doing something like that. Thanks for your help!
