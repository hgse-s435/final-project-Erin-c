Anyone interested in a ScratchEd meet-up and can be in the area of Calgary in the next few months, please fee free to respond. We are looking at computer coding in Scratch and ScratchJR. for kindergarten to high school students. We have stories of successes and challenges to share and workshops ideas to teach.  There are interested people who are making plans and will find out the best timing for the most people before we set a date. Respond to this discussion with your ideas!   Thanks! Lilli

Hi Lilli I am definitely interested in having a ScratchEd meetup in Calgary!

Hello Christina, Sounds great. I am thinking we start small. We can use a similar format to other ScratchEd meetups.  May or June, 2015?



Sure, that would be fine with me. Even if it's just the two of us to start! Should we start a meetup page to see if it gets interest outside of this dicussion group?

For Scratch Day, May 9th, There is an open house to get to know about Scratch at the Telus Sparks Centre.  The Scratch and Learn will be from 11:00 am to about 2:00 pm. I'll be there to help and explain about Scratch. I am also working with a school in Pensylvania on a project that I will be featuring in Amsterdam for Scratch2015AMS. Meet me at Sparks, if you'd like to discuss a ScratchEd meetup and/or this project.

I'm volunteering at the Fish Creek library Coder Dojo until about 1pm that day, but I could probably meet you there after your session is done if that works for you?
