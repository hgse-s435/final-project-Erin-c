Hi!Saskia here, from the Scratch Team. I'm reaching out to tell you a bit about Scratch Day. Each year, people around the world gather at local Scratch Day events to celebrate the Scratch coding language and online community. Scratch Days are festive gatherings that bring young people together to share projects and ideas, tinker, experiment, and learn from one another. The events are typically in May, but can be organized any day of the year! Teachers are celebrating Scratch Day all aroundthe world by hosting gatherings in their schools, dedicating class time to Scratch activities, and/or helping parents connect with Scratch resources. As of now, there are just over 1170 global Scratch Day events. We'd love to see a Scratch Day in every state in the US! Will you join the celebration? If interested in hosting a Scratch Day in your classroom, school, or community, check out the resources on the How to Host page of the Scratch Day site, and see the resources we've created on the Scratch Foundation blog. Scratch on! Saskia
