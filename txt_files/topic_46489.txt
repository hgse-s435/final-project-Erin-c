How do I delete student accounts that I created in my class? Thanks!

Hi Mariette, Here's an answer from the Scratch Team's Teacher Account FAQ Page. It is not possible for a teacher to delete a student account. A student can delete their own account in their Account Settings. I hope this helps, Willa, on behalf of the ScratchEd Team

Thanks Wilhelmina! I REALLY needed to see that information. ?One of my students is leaving my class and so I need her to delete her account. ? ?Thanks, ?A friend from scratched.
