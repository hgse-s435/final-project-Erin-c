This is a message from David J. Malan, Professor of the Practice of Computer Science in the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences at Harvard. Along with others in the community, CS50 at Harvard is preparing a suite of resources for teachers who would like to teach AP CS Principles this coming school year. CS50 itself is Harvards (and Yale's) introduction to computer science for majors and non-majors alike that begins with Scratch and then transitions to C and then to web programming. (The course is also freely available via edX.) CS50 AP, meanwhile, will be a free adaptation for high schools that satisfies the new AP CS Principles curriculum framework. If you or a colleague might like to adopt or adapt CS50 in some form this fall or next, CS50 and our friends at Microsoft will be hosting a number of workshops this year designed to connect and equip educators for just that. (The workshops will offer CEUs and certification for PD.) A number of scholarships are also available for teachers who would like to take the course first through Harvard Extension School in preparation. If youd like to learn more, see https://youtu.be/RVjHSAZdVJg for a quick introduction. And to apply for any of this years workshops (in whichever city is easiest among Boston, DC, London, and San Diego), see https://cs50.harvard.edu/ap/apply for all details. And please feel welcome to write us at ap@cs50.harvard.edu with any questions!
