I am interested in having someone come to my son's Grade 2 classroom to do a Scratch workshop for the kids. The educator does not have to be affiliated with MIT. If anyone knows of someone who is qualified and able to do this, please contact me. My son's school is located about 40 minutes south of Boston. Thank you! Annie annie.kelleher@comcast.net

Dear Annie Kelleher, I teach on the South Shore is your son's school anywhere near Marshfield. I teach afterschool programs in Scratch. You can see my Web site atvickigold.com. Thanks, Vicki Gold
