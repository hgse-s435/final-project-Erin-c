I'm planning to host a number of informal networking events/workshops for CS educators in the Boston area, via this Meetup.com group -http://www.meetup.com/Boston-Computer-Science-Educators/ Please join to stay informed of future events. We'll definitely include some Scratch tutorials for beginning CS educators. Vibin
