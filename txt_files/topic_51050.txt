I am fairly new to this, but am interested in blending an existing unit I have on Rube Goldberg Machines (physically creating them) with an application of it on Scratch. Is there anyone out there, that has lessons or ideas for helping kids (grades2-5) make simple machines like this using scratch? I would really appreciate help with ideas.

Our third graders used Lego WeDo motors and sensors to create Rube Goldberg machines combining physical elements (dominoes, blocks, marbles, ramps, etc.) with Scratch animations. For example, they programmed the distance sensor to react to a domino falling in front of it activating a Scratch animation on the computer. When the animation ended it activated a motor to turn on which pushed a marble down a ramp.
