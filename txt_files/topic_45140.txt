Hi, My name is JP (short for Jean-Paul). I'm looking to start a computer programming tutoring academy for kids in Grades K-12, and am looking at numerous different programs (e.g., Scratch, code.org, code for life, Khan academy, CodeHS, Tynker, codecademy, Code Avengers, Alice, etc.). I'd like to get some feedback and suggestions on 2 things: 1. What are the best programs/curriculums out there to really set kids up for success and give them an advantage with respect to computer programming; and, 2. What programs/curriculums are mpost suitable for the different age and hrade groupos (i.e., K-2, 3-5, 6-8, 9-12)? I'm neither a teac her (although I have taught various courses at various levels), not a programmer (although I have a very basic understandiong of java), so any feedback or suffestions would be greatly appreciated. Thank you ScratchEd! JP
