We're celebrating Scratch Day a week early this year with a Scratch Day Educators Meetup in Holyoke on May 7 so folks can also participate in events in Boston on May 14. Join us at the Massachusetts Green High Performance Computing Center for a three-hour Scratch Meetup for Educators! BYOL (Bring Your Own Laptop), if possible. The event is free and breakfast and lunch are included. Beginner Scratchers and seasoned scratchers are all welcome. Learn more and register here.
