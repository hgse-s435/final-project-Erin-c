I am a creative computing teacher and have 120 students per grade. I want to be abel to share student work with parents, and the world at large but I can't seem to add their projects to the studios I created. I used to be able to do this before Scratch 2.0 but now I can't. Please can someone give me a work around? I have all these projects noone is able to see right now... Thank you, Francesca Zammarano JS Creative Computing Teacher and Tech Integrator United Nations International School New York, NY
