Notes by Karen Brennan from a breakout session hosted at the November 2012 Scratch Educator Meetup Key Question How do we support students who are diverse in their interests and current abilities? Strategies create videos for students, like Colin's Scratch Challenges (http://scratched.media.mit.edu/resources/scratch-challenges-curriculum-beginner-advanced) offer a menu of challenge choices give a general challenge, then giving suggestions for adaptations to individual students build culture of asking a neighbor encourage kids to share their expertise in the classroom respond to the "I'm done" by asking the students to add layers give students freedom in process by providing them with a project specification sheet (e.g. needs to have a score, multiple players)
