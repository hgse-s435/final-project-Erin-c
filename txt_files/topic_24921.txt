Scratch is a really great way to get kids ready for the MIT App Inventor, which uses Scratch-like blocks to code functional Android apps! Give it a try, it works best with Middle and High school ages.

Hi, How can we use AppInventor in Computer Science education? Do you have any documents/e-book about AI education in classroom?

There's an online curriculum located at http://www.appinventor.org/content/teaching-app-inventor/introduction/course-intro.

Thanks a lot.
