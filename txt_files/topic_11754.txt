Does anyone know if LEGO Simple and Motorized Machines iscompatible with Scratch? Link below to the LEGO product. Thank you. Lego Education Simple Machines

Hi Eleanor, I asked Mitch and John (the lead developer of Scratch) and here is how they responded: Comment from Mitch: This kit includes a motor and light, and includes a battery box for controlling them. To control these elements from a computer, you would also need the "controller" that comes with the LEGO WeDo kit -- or you can buy this controller (officially known as the LEGO USB Hub) separately (http://www.legoeducation.us/eng/product/lego_usb_hub/1655). Comment from John: I assume that the motor could be plugged into a WeDo hub and controlled from Scratch. Scratch doesn't have a block to control the light.

Just FYI. I and friends are working to make an inexpensive robot kit named NanoBoardAG now. The target price is under $40. It includes all bricks and devices (motor, controller, etc). NanoBoardAG is based on Arduino and compatible with WeDo and PicoBoard. http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/abee/2297128 http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/haru88/2312017 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAFa-VDtmZM We hope to bring it to next Scratch@MIT. P.S. Scratch 1.4 can control LEGO PF Light 8870 by motor blocks with a little modification. Here is a mod that include it. http://squeakland.jp/abee/tmp/SensorBoardWithMotor.zip
