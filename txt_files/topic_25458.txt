Hello, I would like to organize courses on Scratch for a fee to be able to reward teachers who will participate in the project. Is it possible? thanks

Hi Jhon, Yes, you can teach a course that costs money with Scratch. You can read more in the Scratch permissions FAQ at http://scratch.mit.edu/help/faq/#permissions. I'd love to hear how the course goes! M
