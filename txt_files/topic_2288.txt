We're happy to announce that we have just relaunched the Scratch Day website for this year -- http://day.scratch.mit.edu/ -- and we hope that you'll consider hosting an event. We hope that you're as excited about Scratch Day as we are. We look forward to working together with you and others around the world to celebrate Scratch Day on May 22.
