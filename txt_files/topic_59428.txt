The subject pretty much says it all. I've searched extensively and come up empty. I'd like to get email and/or at least messages. Thanks!

Hi Gary, To my knowledge, you cannot get pop-up notifications, however, the activity tab will keep you posted on student activity (see below). I'd also recommendwriting to the Teaching with Scratch Facebook Group, where we have migrated our discussions. Best, Alexa

Thanks, Alexa. I filled out the form to join the facebook group. Gary

There are Scratch projects that act as noitifiers. But when I tried one - a week or two ago- it was temporarily not working. So I am going to revisit this when Scratch 3 is operational and the dust settles.
