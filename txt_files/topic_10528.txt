I am putting together a document that addresses which Massachusetts Standards Scratch meets, has anyone used it in conjunction with the brand new Math and LA standards?

Interesting... we have some emerging work tying Scratch to the Music standards.

Hi Sarah, Do you have the common core document? If so, would you be willing to share it? I'm new to scratch but think that for coding to gain traction we have to be able to tie it to the common core, at least at the elementary level. I'd be interested in whatever you have come up with. Thx.
