Is it possible and permissible to upload Scratch projects to websites other than MIT's Scratch website?

Yes, definitely. Check out this other discussion topic about this very issue --http://scratched.media.mit.edu/discussions/how-do-i/set-scratch-server-- or the Scratch website FAQ --http://info.scratch.mit.edu/Support/Scratch_FAQ#Embed

Thank you!
