Hi As with any class of children there are those who are excellent and thos that cannot quite grasp how to make a sprite move. I have used paired mixed abilitiy partners - lower ability are happy to sit and watch and not do!! I have used similar ability pairings - need to have too much attention and difficult to see to the needs of a class of 15 pairs. So my question is how best to differentiate a lesson when using Scratch? Best wishes Shaun (UK primary teacher)
