Next year I will be teaching an additional enrichment class to 6th grade students. They will be taking this enrichment class for 10 weeks or one marking period. I want to include at least 4 weeks of Scratch. Does anyone have ideas for projects of a longer duration?I do introduce Scratch in the regular ComputerStudies classes and we spend about a week working on a short project.

Have you looked at the MIT Scratchcurriculum guide? Maybe there are some ideas that you could remix?
