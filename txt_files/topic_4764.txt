Ihave the SCRATCH apps on my personal Iphone. I know that Apple has pulled it from the I-Tunes Store. Is there anyway Ican transfer the Apps to another I tunes account. I have a classroom set ofItouch and would like to put the Scratch client on my school - ITouch so I can pass it around and have students try their apps on the school I-touch. Irealize all this does is PLAY the Scratch projects through the Scratch site. But it still fullfills my need. Icreated a summer program at my school around Scratch and one of the bullet points was that we will develop games and projects that "run" on an I-Touch. (THATWASBEFORE Apple pulled the client) Can anyone help? Lucie
