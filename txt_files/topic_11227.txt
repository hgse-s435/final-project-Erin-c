Hi everyone, I'm really happy to let you know that ScratchEd is (mostly) up and running again. Of course, I'm expecting bugs to pop up here and there -- if you notice anything, please don't hesitate to let me know. Bug reports are always welcome! Some aspects of the redesign that I'm particularly excited about: The redesign of the Resources section. In addition to refining the design of the search interface (now including searching by language!), we have three different pathways: new to Scratch, familiar with Scratch, and experienced with Scratch. If you have comments or suggestions for the pathways pages, I'd love to hear them. The addition of the Events section. Our events were formerly listed on a separate site, which made it hard to keep track of them. I'm hoping this integration will help people feel more connected to the face-to-face and real-time components of the ScratchEd community. The redesign of the Members section. You can now find people with similar interests (by age/grade level, curricular area, language) in addition to geographic proximity. To specify your interests, go to your profile ("My Profile") at the top-right of the screen, then "Edit", then "Member". We'll be sending more information about the changes (in a video tutorial format) later this week. Thank you! Karen
