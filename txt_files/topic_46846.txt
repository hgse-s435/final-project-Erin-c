I am wondering why there is no Pen tutorial/scratchcards on Scratch? can you recommend any good tutorial?

Hi Nilanjan, Thanks for your post. * If you click on the question mark icon in the upper right side of the editor, there is a tips window for the pen tool. * Here are two tutorials that might be useful: https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/37103/ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-EdwnMdfok That's just a start! Good luck, and please keep us posted on what you discover! Willa, on behalf of the ScratchEd Team
