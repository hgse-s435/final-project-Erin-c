My friend's band, Three Day Threshold, is playing a show in Cambridge tonight (Friday). Y'all should come check it out! They're playing at Toad, which is just a short hop on the T away - just take the Red Line to the Porter Square stop. Here's a handy map! They play "Country and roots rock with Celtic, Punk, and Bluegrass influences". Their set starts at 10pm. Cheers!
