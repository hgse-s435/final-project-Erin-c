Greetings all - Here is a helpful summary of the steps required to install Scratch on a Novell Network, generously provided by Bill Pickle from Bellevue Public Schools, Bellevue, NE. I'm posting it here so that School ITexperts can find it... Hi, > > > I was asked to load Scratch on a Novell network that has netware6.5 servers. The instructions on your site do not include how to install and run Scratch in a Netware environment. We use the Netware Application Launcher (NAL) to deliver apps to userd. I got it to work and thought you might like to know how I did it. > > > Here is how I got it to work: > > > installed program on a windows workstation. copied the Scratch folder to the netware server. created an icon in the NAL. in the run options the path to file: (for example) \srv olderscratch.exe just below this line is Prameters: this must be set to \srv olderscratchscratch.image > > > Without the parameter set the program asks for the location of the .image file. The applications run from a hidden server share in our environment, so students can not browse to the app location.
