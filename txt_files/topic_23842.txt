The possibility to add tutorials to the tips bar is great! Two questions: Will the tutorial be available for translation? Can we add our own tutorials?

Hi Manuel, Great questions! We are currently looking for help translating the Scratch Hour of Code tutorial. Please leave a comment on this discussion thread if you're interested in contributing. - http://scratched.media.mit.edu/node/24076 The Hour of Code tutorial was designed specifically for this event, so the option of people adding their own tutorials to the tips window is not available at this time. Sincerely, Michelle Chung, on behalf of the ScratchEd Team
