Hi what age group are you going to be working with. If you would like I can email some resources to you - still working on them at present but my email is awilson169@gmail.com. I also used Scratch with 8/9yr olds last year for my honours project at uni - there is a paper in the resources section which shows what i did and some results.

There are some suggestions for activitiesinhttp://scratched.media.mit.edu/resources/designing-scratch-workshop -- It might give you some ideas. Good luck, and please do let us know how it goes! Thanks, K
