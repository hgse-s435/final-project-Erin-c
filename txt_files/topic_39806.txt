I actually have 2 questions. 1) Is the new Lego WeDo 2.0 set compatible with Scratch? I was recently awarded a grant to order Lego WeDo bots for my elementary technology classes and need to know if I should order the original WeDo kits or the newer 2.0. 2) Is it possible to use a Chromebook to use Scratch with Lego WeDo? I have a few Windows run laptops but I have a class set of Chromebooks and it would be easier to use those if at all possible. Thanks in advance.

LEGO Education says that WeDo 2.0 will have a Scratch 2.0 interface, to be released in late January/February 2016 for Mac OS X and later in 2016 for Windows. Generally, I'm impressed with WeDo 2.0. Lots of very useful parts, easy connection, and some good projects. I haven't yet worked with students on WeDo 2.0 but it looks like it is open-ended enough to invite improvisation and not just rote replication of pre-existing projects. Sorry to say, I don't have an answer to your Chromebook question.

Unfortunately, none of the hardware extensions work - or will work - on Chromebooks. Sorry I don't have better news, Willa

Good news, I have gotten WeDo 1.4's to work with Scratch 2.0 on Chromebooks. http://www.picaxe.com/Teaching/Other-Software/Scratch-Helper-Apps/ http://www.picaxe.com/docs/s2bot.pdf http://workshops.sjcoe.org/Uploads/71520156592239808.pdf

The awesome Scratch team has released its extensions for WeDo 2.0: http://scratch.mit.edu/wedo? Check it out! I have been able to connect my Mac OSX computer to the WeDo 2.0 and used the Scratch extension blocks.

It must to work with chromebooks, extension works with any explorer, isn't it?
