I am a PK3-5th Grade Technology teacher, and I am piloting a curriculum centered around teaching Scratch in my school. I was hoping as a culminating part to the unit (to occur sometime between April-May) some of the Scratch pioneers would be willing to participate in a Skype session with some of my 4th & 5th grade students? They have a lot of questions and we are part of the Project Zero Visibile Thinking Curriculum and this could really help foster a culture of thinking by using technology! Please let me know if anyone knows how to go about this (ie who to contact, etc), or if you are able/willing to participate in it! Thanks so much, Alexis Cobo coboa@nbps.org

Hi Alexis, I'm so excited to hear about your pilot program with Scratch! Regarding your request for a Skype session, the Scratch team is made up of a very small group of designers, so although we love connecting with other Scratchers, our time is unfortunately limited to do the type of interaction you're asking about. I would recommend checking out this new Scratch project that features Q&A with some of the Scratch Team members that might interest you and your students - http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/sparks/3013192. You could also send a message tohelp@scratch.mit.eduto see if other Scratch Team members are available. Sincerely, Michelle, on behalf of the ScratchEd Team
