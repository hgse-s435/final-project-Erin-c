How do I log into my scratch ed account to create and work on a class?

Hi Sara! You may be thinking of Teacher Accounts on Scratch. If you visit scratch.mit.edu it should allow you to log in if you've created an account through their site! Let us know if any other issues arise :). Best, Alexa from the ScratchEd Team

Hi David! Have you seen this resource before?It will walk you through the process of creating a teacher account on Scratch.mit.edu. I'd also recommend you reach out to the Teaching with Scratch Facebook Group to hear from other educators about their experiences with Teacher accounts! I hope this is helpful! Best, Alexa
