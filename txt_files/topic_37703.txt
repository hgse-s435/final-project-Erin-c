I'm curious about the impulses that underlie children's drive to create games (in a variety of platforms, including Scratch), especially children ages 6-9. The factors I've seen in my own teaching seem to include: creating a game that is optimally hard to win, for the creator creating a game that is relatively easy for the creator to win creating a world a personally meaningful/interesting style and having total control over the game design and structure creating a game that challenge or otherwise impress a friend/sibling What else do you think is going on? What percentage of kids do you think want total control, to start with a blank slate? And what portion want to start with something like a template that they can tweak? Let me know what you think!
