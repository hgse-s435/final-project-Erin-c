Hello all, I've just updated the No Starch PressScratch book to cover Scratch 2. nostarch.com/scratch Here aretwo free chapters from the book, they're a nice, friendly introduction to the Scratch 2 interface. You can use them with the book, or just as a nice standalone intro. I've also created a basic "educator's guide," a companion to the book, for teachers, parents and other educators that you can download from the link above. Hope you find these useful! Cheers, Tyler

It is a great book too and highly recommended :)
