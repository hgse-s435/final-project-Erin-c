I would like to discuss assessment tools specifically the creation of rubrics to address student motivation and creativity. With an emphasis on how to create this rubric without stifling creativity while still making this rubric a helpful learning tool for students. Ive been talking to a number of my students about the phrase exceeds expectation, and have found a level of frustration as to what this means even when examples of excellent work are posted. Thanks Vicki Gold
