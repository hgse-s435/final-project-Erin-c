I teach a high school animation class. It is a year long elective that meets 3 times a week for 46 minutes. I'm planning to weave Scratch and Flash throughout the year with iStop Motion rather than have a software based class. Is there anyone in the Scratch Educator community who also teaches Flash? I'd be happy to share what I put together and would love a collaborator or someone just to share ideas!

I am curious as to why you are using Flash and Scratch for animation only. (Please excuse me if I am confused.) For animation, I would use Blender. It is an excellent animation studio which is reasonably easy to learn. Currently, I am teaching beginning programming using Scratch to elementary students. I plan to introduce some animation using scratch, but plan to go further into programming; gaming, applications, etc. Scratch is a grreat tool for introducing the basics of programming. Flash is a great tool for animation, but its true strength is in programming. Flash requires a higher degree of computer programming understanding. My background: Computer science, 10 years experience. I program in many different languages; VB, Java, JS, C#, C++, Perl, PHP, and others (If I haven't used the language before, give me a short time and I will). I have taught Robotics, Web design and applications, Flash design and programming, and Computer programming. I also tutor in math, science, ELA, throughout the educational levels. (Elementary - College) I will gladly offer my insights and opinions; answer any questions to the best of my ability, and help in any way possible. (The expression, "Pay it forward." comes to mind. I would not be where I am today without the guidance of others.)
