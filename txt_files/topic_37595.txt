hi, I am an artist, programmer and researcher. I am researching the teaching of software to artists. My experience has been that there is a great deal of resistance to this. I am interested to learn what has been the experience of other educators who teach coding to artistsusing scratch. Thank You Dr Greg Giannis

Hi Greg, Thanks for (re)posting this post. I have a background working teaching artists, but not working with TAs and coding. I'm curious to know more about the resistance you've heard about and I wonder whether it was the subject (was it discomfort with digital media?) or the way the subject was introduced (was it a mandate?). Here's a ScratchEd story from last year that relates - about an Artist in Residence who uses Scratch with student artists: http://scratched.gse.harvard.edu/stories/using-scratch-teaching-artist-residency-florida Direct link to Nathan's blog here: http://nathanselikoff.com/2316/events/teaching-artist-residency-stone-middle-school I would love to continue this conversation and keep looking for resources. Thanks! Willa
