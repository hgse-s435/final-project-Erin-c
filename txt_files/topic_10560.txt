Hello all: I am looking for schools that would like to participate in a research study involving Scratch. I am interested in Scratch and self-directed learning skills. If you think that this could be appealing to your school, please email me (tferrerm@gmail.com ) and I will give you a more detailed explanation! Thanks! Teresa
