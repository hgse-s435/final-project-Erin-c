Is there anyone who will connect the math study and Scratch in China ? Now i am researching that

Hi. I have been teaching math content with Logo programming since the 90's. Currently, I am in the process of moving activities from Logo to Scratch. Since I am at the university I welcome the chance to work with classroom teachers so the activites are designed to meet specific mathematics learning objectives. I don't know if this fits your question. Check out my work on thiswiki.
