Hi, I've been using screen shots from Scratch to make manuals for my coding clubs. What's the copyright status of this material? I assume it's OK for non-business purposes? How about for use in coding clubs that charge a tuition fee? What if I'd like to publish my manuals? Also, are there any resources that explain copyright issues associated with, for example, using an image or sound file copied from a website and using it in shared Scratch projects? Cheers, Martin

I would also like to see the answer to this issue.

Here's the answer from the MIT Scratch Team, available on their FAQ page:https://scratch.mit.edu/info/faq/ Can I use Scratch and / or screenshots of Scratch in a textbook or a CD? Yes, you can even write a book or chapter about Scratch. You may also use the Scratch logo when referring to Scratch. You may create screenshots / images of the Scratch application and website, and consider them to be licensed under theCreative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike license. We ask that you include a note on your textbook / CD / what have you that says "Scratch is developed by the Lifelong Kindergarten Group at the MIT Media Lab. See http://scratch.mit.edu". Can I include a description of Scratch and the Scratch logo in brochures or other materials? Sure! We recommend the following description: "Scratch is a programming language and online community where you can create your own interactive stories, games, and animations -- and share your creations with others around the world. In the process of designing and programming Scratch projects, young people learn to think creatively, reason systematically, and work collaboratively. Scratch is a project of the Lifelong Kindergarten group at the MIT Media Lab. It is available for free at http://scratch.mit.edu"

thank you
