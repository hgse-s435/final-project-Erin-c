Very exciting!!! Back in July, I trained K-12 teachers across California. Now, I will be teaching Scratch to 70+ Engineering colleges across India next month via WebEx, thanks to Massachusetts professer for making this happen. Soon, I will be teaching orphanages across India how to Scratch in their local languages so the gift of Scratch be shared across the world. I will keep you posted. -Sankar Srivata

Hi Sankar, I'd be really interested to learn more about your program with colleges in India. Perhaps you can update us on progress? Regarfds, Rory
