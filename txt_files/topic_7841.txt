Does anyone know if there are UK suppliers of the Sensorboards. As part of my job I am not allowed to use either Paypal or a Credit Card for purchases related to work. If there were a supplier in the UK I could then raise an invoice, etc. Otherwise I would have to buy it/them myself which I don't mind doing for one but not a class set!

Hi Nick, I'd recommend contacting the Scratch Board distributors for suggestions. You can reach them at picoboard@playfulinvention.com Sincerely, K
