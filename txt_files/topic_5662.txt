I'm at the Scratch @ MIT conference in the Saturday keynote with teachers (which is terrific! itboth the kids and teachers presenting together) and am really interested in finding out how the presentations integrate scratch into the screen presentations - it seems like its in Powerpoint - do folks have examples how they integrate their projects inside a presentation?
