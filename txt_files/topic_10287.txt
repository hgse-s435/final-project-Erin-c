If you could have more scratch cards, what would they be?

Here is the link to the illustrator files http://info.scratch.mit.edu/Translation/Translating_Scratch_Materials and the fonts http://wiki.scratch.mit.edu/wiki/Scratch_Font

Just posted my first Scratch Card, let me know what you think and I need ideas for more! http://scratched.media.mit.edu/resources/using-pen-tool-scratch-card

Thanks for the info Sarah. Very informative

Sarah, this is great. I'll be sure to share this with my school. Thanks!
