Hello, how do I learn more about how to use Scratch? I am the host of a technology club at my elementary school called:Google CS First When students raise their hands for questions they have with the projects they are creating in Scratch, much of the time I can't answer them. Thank you, Julie Knott, Librarian Unity West Elementary Tolono, IL

Could you email any responses to the question of how do I learn about using Scratch to: knottj@unity.k12.il.us Thank you! Julie Knott, Librarian
