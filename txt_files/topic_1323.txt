Hi Karen, Are you planning to record the workshop? I'd love to see how it goes. Also, you might already have more than enough interest, but if you want to spread the word about Scratch in general, and your workshop in particular, I've found linkedin.com to be an extremely useful site for professional networking. Best of luck, Rick

I hadn't thought about recording the workshop, but it's an interesting suggestion! I'm going to see if one of the interns working on ScratchEd this term might be able to attend and help with the recording process. Thanks! K
