Is anyone using Scratch with adults learners with significant first language text and numeracy barriers? The hands-on numeric manipulation of the characters seems like an engaging "number sense" instructional tool, but the Scratch text interface might be too complicate for users with low level text skills. I would apprecaite insights from any Scratch users with first hand adult instructional experience. Thank you,
