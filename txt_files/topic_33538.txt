Is there a database that I can direct parents to where they can find information about summer technology workshops/camps?

Hi I see you are in Massachusetts, so I recommend the list of summer computing camps and workshops for students we compile at CAITE here: http://caite.cs.umass.edu/students/SummerOpsStudents2015.html or the listing MassTLC Ed Fdn keeps here: http://masstlcef.org/after-school-summer-programs/ Good luck! -RF
