I've completed a 32-video online course covering Scratch programming. It's free to sign up for using the coupon code SCRATCH_FORUM: https://www.udemy.com/scratch-game-programming/?couponCode=SCRATCH_FORUM The course provides step-by-steo instructions for creating six game and art projects in Scratch. These projects are from my book Scratch Programming Playground, which is released under a Creative Commons license. It's free to read online at https://inventwithscratch.com. I'm interested in receiving feedback about the course, and would love it if you could forward this coupon code to others. I want to put programming resources in the hands of as many people as possible.
