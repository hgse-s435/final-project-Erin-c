I have old posters for Scratch 1.4 that list all the categories and each block that is within that category but am looking for the same type of posters for Scratch 2.0. These are the ones I used for Scratch 1.4 https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B3-taY_wcWo5dHMwMk9vdHNNSjA/view Thanks so much! I need to update my Scratch bulletin board now that we are using Scratch 2.0.
