Any runners attending the conference? I'd like to get a run in Thursday & Sat morning before breakfast.

I don't run too fast, lol... but I would like to run around the river in the morning. Where are you staying?... I am at the Marriot Hotel.

Vera - I am a pretty slow runner. I'm at Baker Hall. I was planning on starting my run by 6:30 and going 2.5 miles. It would be nice to start with coffee & looks like the Marriot's got a Starbucks. Want to try & meet there at 6:30? You can contact me via e-mail techkim@kimxtom.com.

Kim- I was thinking about to exercise from 6 to 7, so I will be able to come back to the hotel and get ready for the conference. Does that work for you??

Vera - sorry I didn't see this until it was too late. Hope you had a good run. I enjoyed the flatness!

Kim!, I wish it was possible for us to meet... I just run at the gym, lol... but I think I know every building infront of the hotel by heart, lol. But... anyway, maybe next time everybody attending the Scratch Conference would like to walk around the river, at least, lol.
