When teaching Python or Java, I always have students submit their programs electronically (so that I could run the programs) and turn in printouts of their source code and output. Having the hardcopy makes it easier for me to grade and give feedback, particularly since I can mark directly on the code and point out both good and bad points in the student's work. With Scratch, getting hardcopy is a little more complicated, but certain screenshots can be submitted. I was just wondering if anyone else does this with Scratch, and how it has worked? With each sprite having its own script, it could get a little complicated to make sure that everything is included. Thanks in advance for any thoughts or advice you can give!
