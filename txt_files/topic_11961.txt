Hello everybody, I am new to the community. I am teaching Scratch to secondary education students (3rd grade junior high school) and I have to admit every single student loves it! As far as I know I am the only one teaching Scratch at school in my region. I would very much like to have the opportunity and the means to further promote both the Scratch spirit and its community. So I was wondering if there is any chance of a local event (or in Greece, in general)preferably in the Greek language. I also think it would be a great idea if I could give promotion goods to the students such as Scratch t-shirts and the like. Is such type of support / promotion available? Thank you very much in advance, Dimitris
