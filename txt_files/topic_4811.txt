I know this seems like a strange question for a Scratch message board but I didn't know where else to ask. I've been teaching Scratch this summer to teachgame designbut I also want to give my kids some exposure to flash game design as well. Does anyone know of a good online or offline application to teach flash? I need something that is free or cheap (preferably free). I need something that kids could learn. Thanks!
