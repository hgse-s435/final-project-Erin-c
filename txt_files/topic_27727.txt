This summer, Pursuitery is hosting free Coding with Scratchclasses offered by the Connected Learning Alliance, that brings together organizations, programs, projects, initiatives and individuals working to leverage todays technology for more equitable access to learning and opportunity for all young people. The class employs social media for feedback and sharing, and offers an opportunity for students to gain experience with STEAM (science, technology, engineering, art and mathematics) skills in a fun and supportive environment. Participants will be working alongside peers, youth mentors, experts, and Scratch Coaches. Young people will learn how to think creatively, reason systematically and work collaboratively  essential skills for life in the 21st century. Participate through the citys' website if you are a Cities of Learning participant (Chicago, Columbus, Dallas, Los Angeles, Pittsburgh, Washington D.C.), or sign up through the "Coding with Scratch" website. Session 1: June 16 _ July 20 , 2014 Session 2: July 21 _ August 24, 2014 More information is available at http://summer.pursuitery.com/scratch Sign up to be a Scratch Coach at http://summer.pursuitery.com/scratchcoaches Contact summer@pursuitery.com or tweet@Pursuitery with questions or comments.

As one of the developers of Coding with Scratch, we are very interested in scratch teachers comments on the activities. This was my first time working on an open online scratch class (scratch MOOC) and it is a real challenge to know how much information to give at the beginning and how to help students who get stuck. Any feedback is appreciated! Here is the badge kids can get if you finish the class:
