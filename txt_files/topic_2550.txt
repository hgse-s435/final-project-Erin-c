During the summer of 2010, my team is schedule to hold a 5 week summer camp for urban middle school students. We would like to feature scratch as one of the core summer activities. I'm in search of someone who would be interested in facilitating our class at The University of Hartford.

Are there people close to your location on the members map? Perhaps you could try contacting those people. (Please let me know if you need any help getting in touch with them...)

Hi Bruce, I am a technology teacher from Newtown,CT. I currently teach Scratch to my students (grades 3 - 7), and I also taught at NVCCKids On Campus last summer to students grades 4 - 11. So I would be interested in learning more about your program. You can reach met at my school e-mail at pgans@fraserwoods.com Thank you Patrice
