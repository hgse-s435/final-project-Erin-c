I was think about doing a breakout session about debugging activities. Any interest?

I am definitely interested.

That sounds like fun (but doesn't it all?! ) -- I would be interested as well. Thanks, Karen.

I also want to learn about remixes and the Scratch website. I am intrigued by the project: For the People of Japan. and its Remix Visualization.
