Hi, does anybody know how to sign up for the PD online course about Scratch ? I can't wait to attend. Thank you very much.

Hi Roberto, You can find out more about the Creative Computing Online Workshop by joining the Creative Computing Google+ Community. Registration will be available starting June 1. Looking forward to having you join the workshop! Michelle Chung, on behalf of the ScratchEd Team

Thank you very much Michelle ! All the best, Roberto

We are launching a three day workshop free for teachers in Sacramento. This workshop would aid teachers interested in launching a computing curriculum in their classroom or school or just learn creative programming. The workshop is in a school sponsored by Seal Point Academy (www.SealPointAcademy.com) and the school district. More information would be available next week. The date is July-23-25, 2013.
