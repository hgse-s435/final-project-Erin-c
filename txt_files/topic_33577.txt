Hello See theese projects http://scratch.mit.edu/users/pommerit I have made a start project for all the pupils 8 and 9 years old and they remixed its. They only have to change lego models (pictures exported with blockcad ) , two variables (number of models and answer's position in the list ) descriptions and sounds. It is in French but you can use it in your language Enjoy Alain

thanks
