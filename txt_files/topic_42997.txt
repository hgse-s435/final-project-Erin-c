The workshop on computational thinking in education will pay a tribute to the visionaries who 50 years ago started to transform the way computer science is used in education. Educators and researchers from 3 different continents will share what they are doing now, 50 years later. And everyone who attends will be invited to share their views on the use of computer science and computational thinking in education in the future... perhaps in another 50 years :-) A tasting of Spanish wines will be served at the end of the event. Speakers: Cynthia Solomon, Logo Group, MIT. Computer cultures for children - From Logo to Scratch and beyond Richard Millwood, Trinity College Dublin (Ireland). A critique of the current trend to implement computing in schools with reference to the past in UK and Ireland Gregorio Robles, Universidad Rey Juan Carlos (Spain). Assessment of computational thinking skills Yetunde Folajimi, University of Ibadan (Nigeria). Nigeria Geek Girls Club: creating a new face of Africa through computer games and apps development Gilly Puttick, TERC, and Jackie Barnes, Northeastern University.
