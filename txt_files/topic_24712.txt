I am planning to teach Scratch in a class where most students are on Chromebooks. I saw at least one post here that made it sound like there were problems on Chromebooks, but I have also seen posts saying there should be no problem. Do you have experiences with Scratch on particular Chromebook models that either did or did not turn out well?
