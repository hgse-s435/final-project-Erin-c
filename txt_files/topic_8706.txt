Hello researchers, I am delighted to let you know about an interactive conference session, Scratch on the Surface and Beyond: a Creative Programming Language for All Ages, at iConference in Seattle in February, 2011. The iConference is an annual interdisciplinary conference on the study of people, information, and technology, and sessions are selected by a competitive and rigorous review process. The Scratch session was designed to introduce and expand knowledge of iConference attendees about Scratch. Participants will have an opportunity to engage in hands-on exploration as well as to discuss the broad potential applications of Scratch for a diversity of disciplines, ages, and purposes. It is organized and will be implemented by Dr. Eliza Dresang, Cleary Professor of Children and Youth Services at University of Washington (UW), and Kyungwon Koh, a Florida State University (FSU) lead doctoral student, with participation by five additional doctoral students from UW and FSU (Katie Campana, Melissa Johnston, Michael Lee, John Marino, and Beth Patin).
