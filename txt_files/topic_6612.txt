I work at a PreK through 12 school in Cambridge, Massachusetts that is looking to collaborate with a school in India via scratch. We are open to several possibilities. We would love to create scratch projects to share with you and have you swap projects to share with us. OR even better, we would love to use the scratch site to collaborate to remix each other's projects to work together in creating projects between partners internationally. Please reply if you are a school in India and you are interested. I have about 60 6th graders that will be creating several scratch projects this year related to their civil rights unit and their human rights unit in social studies/history class. -Megan Haddadi megan_haddadi@bbns.org

Megan, I run Millennium National School in Pune, India (www.myshala.com). We have 9th graders learning Scratch, but am thinking of starting from Std. 5. Let us discuss how we can take this further over email. My email address is nikhil dot karkare at myshala dot com. Hoping to hear from you soon. Regards, Nikhil.
