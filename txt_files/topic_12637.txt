Hi all, I'm still planning to come with about 5 high school students who will be leading a workshop. We will be making some final plans this week. We'd love to connect with anyone else planning to stay in the dorms and/or bring students of any age. Please respond! We're planning to arrive late afternoon Wednesday and stay until the end on Saturday.
