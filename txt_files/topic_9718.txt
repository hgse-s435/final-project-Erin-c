The annual Logo Summer Institute will take place August 1-5 in New York City. This one-week intensive hands-on workshop for teachers includes explorations of several Logo and robotics learning environments. In recent years Scratch has become increasingly prominent. The program is highly individualized, so participants wishing to focus entirely on Scratch may do so. The facilitators for the workshop are myself, Hope Chafiian of the Spence School, and Steve Farnsworth of the Robert Louis Stevenson School.
