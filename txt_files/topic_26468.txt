Hello ScratchEd Team, With my 4th graders today, I had sent them to the CCOW "About Me" studio to view the projects as they are going to make an About Me project . Like only 4th graders can do, they found the few projects that were not Intro projects created by CCOW but random projects that were not entirely appropiate for viewing in a school setting. One was a shooter game, and another was a project that shows an ax striking a character in the head.  Is there anyway that these projects can be removed from this studio?  Attached is a screenshot showing the projects. Thanks, Sandy

Hi Sandy, Thanks for letting us know! I reported the axe project and removed non-"About me" projects from the gallery. Please let me know if I missed anything -- and thanks again for the report. Sincerely, K

Thank you Karen!
