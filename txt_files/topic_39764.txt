I'm the organizer of the new Pasadena Scratch Educators Meetup (PaScratchers). Last Sunday we held our first event drawing 9 educators and we are enthusiastic to draw even more of you from the Los Angeles area to come join us. Our future events can be found on our meetup.com site. Don't hesitate to contact me. Cheers, Keith
