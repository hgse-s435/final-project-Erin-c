Friday we will stream our Amsterdam event "Scratch Music Machine". From one of the nicest venues in Amsterdam: the Teatrum Anatomicum at Waag, you can watch us build a music project with Scratch, Picoboards and Build Your Own Blocks. Friday May 18th, 4-7 PM CEST (that's 10 AM till 1 PM if you happen to live in Boston ...) If other events are stremaing, let me know in the comments, may be interesting to broadcast here in Amsterdam (our second event is Saturday May 19th 10 AM - 3 PM CEST)

I think its a great idea to broadcast our events so that other people can share the experience! In our Scratch Day event "World Museum 2012", we will be broadcasting via the "World Museum Channel". We will also be connecting via facetime with other events in Sydney, Hong Kong and Tokyo, as well as groups in Mongolia and Hakodate, who have no event to attend. We think by connecting many places around the world, we can enrich our experiences and broaden our visions in this wonderful opportunity! Cheers! Yoshiro Miyata, World Museum Project
