My students work cannot be shared with me through the Google Classroom. Scratch 2.0 was easy to share the link and I could see the work. Since the new Scratch 3.0 students work once they share it through the link can't be seen. The message is "Whoops! Our server is Scratch'ingits head We couldn't find the page you're looking for. Check to make sure you've typed the URL correctly. If you know how to fix this problem pleaselet me know!

Hi Sheila! I'd recommendsharing this question with the Teaching with Scratch Facebook Group, where we've migrated many of our discussions! I imagine some of the teachers there may know what to do! Best, Alexa
