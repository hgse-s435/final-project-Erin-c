(some of my 8th grade students do have their own accounts, but most of the younger students do not.)the students are saving their work to the school network.from there, idisplay projects on the smartboard for group discussion and as a class we share(upload) them online through my computer. we also have downloaded some projects from the website to the school network through my account and the students are beginning to learn about remixing. when posting information to be shared publicly, i cautioned the students to be mindful of revealing personal information. this was a particular concern when creating the all about me projects-some students revised their original projects to create a \"safer\" version for online sharing.\\n\\n', '10295': \"i had a wonderful time at the creative computing workshop andi wanted to thank everyone for making our time together a meaningful experience. i learned a lot about teaching scratch and i look forward to sharing my new found insights with my students. i would love for us to continue to share and possibly meet in the future. i would like to discuss the possibility of having a meetup in connecticut in the fall. we could get together on either a saturday or a sunday at a local public library (they have free internet and available meeting rooms). i thought that the topic of our meetup could be the planning of a group activity, centered around scratch for computer science education week. here is some information about last year's csedweek - http://www.csedweek.org/. thanks again for an amazing learning opportunity! patrice gans pgans@fraserwoods.com\\n\\nthis sounds like a great idea. i'm in.\\n\\ngreat. let's talk some more.\\n\\npatrice, i'd love to do this. do you have a weekend in mind?\\n\\ni don't have a specific weekend in mind, but i am open to suggestions. i am pretty busy through october, but november looks open.how about if you both contact me via my e-mail address and try and work something out.\\n\\n\", '29414': 'hi, it seems i stopped receiveing updates about the discussion on scratched in a while. i checked back and it seems all my subscriptions are active. how can i do to fix it? thank you very much!\\n\\nhi robert, we recently updated the scratched website, and somehow, subscriptions were turned off. we are working on fixing the bug. thanks for letting us know. sincerely, michelle. on behalf of the scratched team\\n\\n', '33316': 'my students all have gmail accounts, howerver these accounts are locked down so they don\\'t receive any emails from outside of the district. this serves as a difficult situation for me because i want my students to be able to embed their projects on their district webpage. is there a way for them to have access to the embedding code without having to verify/confirm an email account?\\n\\nas far as i know, the scratch team is working on educators accounts that would solve the problem you have but a solution could be... 1. ask your students to download their projects 2. you, as a teacher, upload the projects in a \"school\" studio. 3. share the studio link in your district webpage frank\\n\\nto add to frank\\'s answer... i\\'ve received several questions about this, which i\\'ve forwarded to the mit scratch team.here\\'s how they responded: we suggest using a single email address (e.g., your own) to approve all of your student accounts.

(i have previously used scratch+wedo on windows, but i\\'m hoping to start using linux so that i can re-purpose old computers, plus encourage more educators and parents to try linux with kids.) but...i am having trouble, i think, getting the lego wedo usb connection to be recognized consistently through linux. i have recently obtained a raspberry pi, which came with a raspbian distro (debian wheezy) , and the included scratch 1.4 version worked right away with the wedo usb connection. yay! however, not so much luck with another version of linux on some laptops that i tried. boo. as you may know, in scratch, there are some special functions (program blocks) that interact with the wedo motor and sensors through the special wedo usb hub. the documentation that i can find says that scratch will show these special function blocks only when the wedo usb hub is active/recognized. (one can force-display the blocks through a menu option, but that doesn\\'t necessarily mean they\\'ll work). i installed the ubermix (ubuntu) distro on 2 old-ish dell latitude d610\\'s, and the wedo usb connection does not seem to be working/recognized on either laptop. (the special blocks do not appear in scratch 1.4, nor does any sensor or motor work, even if i make the blocks appear by using the menu, then put them in a program. and yes, i tried both motor and sensors, & all of the usb ports.) anyone got clues to help me? maybe i should just try another kid-friendly distro? (anyone triededubuntu ordoudoulinux?) i figure it\\'s usb drivers or hardware config or permissions or something, buti am not at all an expert with linux and i don\\'t have that much time. i can edit config files, etc, if i have instructions. i also have a few linux-loving friends who i can call upon if needed, but i\\'d like to have first done whatever research i can. (*see below) also, i cannot really ?advocate?for other teachers to try this if it\\'s not fairly easy. but if there is a fairly simple fix, i\\'d be happy to help make sure it gets spread around. i do have a deadline of sorts -- trying to have this working for demos at a maker faire in may 2014. any help appreciated! ~ ms. g intexas * here are all the web clues i have found so far: re: no support for lego wedo in scratch on linux (scratch team mailing list archive): https://lists.launchpad.net/scratch/msg00269.html scratch in debian (miriam ruiz blog): http://www.miriamruiz.es/weblog/?p=678 scratch on the raspberry pi (scratched forums): http://scratched.media.mit.edu/discussions/teaching-scratch/scratch-raspberry-pi lego wedo & scratch (raspberry pi forums): http://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=63&t=62957 scratch and gpio (raspberry pi forums): http://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=77&t=15604 scratch to hardware api: call for discussions (raspberry pi forums): http://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/posting.php?mode=quote&f=77&p=511369\\n\\nplease try this: functionality can be restored by installing the following file /etc/udev/rules.d/99-wedo.rules with the following content: attrs{idvendor}==\"0694\", attrs{idproduct}==\"0003\", subsystems==\"usb\", action==\"add\", mode=\"0666\", group=\"plugdev\"\\n\\nthanks, sjoerd, ...but alas, adding that file didn\\'t work. this is similar to the solution discussed at http://www.miriamruiz.es/weblog/?p=678 so i was really hopeful. where did you get this info?

there are some great introductory lesson plans in there such as the about me and dance party projects. also, the scratch cards might be a useful resource for helping students get started. m\\n\\nmichelle, i ended up just doing an ad-hoc lesson for both classes. i started out explaining how scripts work and introducing them to some basic commands to change position, color, etc... and then had them spend time experimenting. they came up with quite a few great ideas. i was amazed at how quickly the 1st graders caught on. the 3rd graders progressed even faster, and we eventually gave them a challenge task of making a sprite move through obstacles (using commands for arrow buttons, and then autonomously). an alternate challenge was to create a conversation between 2 or more sprites. the 3rd grade teacher is planning to use scratch to teach cartesian coordinate system, and maybe some other math concepts. it was a very rewarding day for me and great for the kids. i think about half of them downloaded the program at home. i\\'m glad i found out about scratch - what a great way to introduce programming to kids. regards, matt\\n\\nhi matt, thanks for sharing! it sounds like both you and the students enjoyed experimenting with scratch. i love the idea of giving the students challenges/obstacles to explore other blocks and scripts. teaching cartesian coordinates in scratch is a useful one, especially using the \"glide to\" block. you could also mention to the 3rd grade teacher that there is an xy-grid background in scratch that might be useful. m\\n\\njust saw this. i use code.org\\'s curriculum to teach the 1st to 3rd grader. the result is great. you actually don\\'t need a computer. ipad or android tablet will work. hope that helps. harry\\n\\n', '4764': 'ihave the scratch apps on my personal iphone. i know that apple has pulled it from the i-tunes store. is there anyway ican transfer the apps to another i tunes account. i have a classroom set ofitouch and would like to put the scratch client on my school - itouch so i can pass it around and have students try their apps on the school i-touch. irealize all this does is play the scratch projects through the scratch site. but it still fullfills my need. icreated a summer program at my school around scratch and one of the bullet points was that we will develop games and projects that \"run\" on an i-touch.

(this can be viewed and downloaded on the scratch site at http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/tinkerzone/2025446) this clock uses 8 variable throughout the scripts. the clocks movement and time keeping is math and scripting. if you download the program and study it, you will see how i used the variables throughout to accomplish this.the clock actually keeps time reasonably well. (especially since there is no connection between it and the system clock) other uses for variable involve user interaction. certain user input should be held by a variable. a calculator is a good example of using variables. when you input the first number it is assigned to a variable. then you choose an operation and input a second number which is held by another variable. then the calculation is done and the answer is stored in another variable. if the calculator stored these input values permanently, the application would eventually become unusable due to size. by storing temporary information in a variable, the program remains intact and the temp information is deleted when it is not needed. if you open a word doc and start typing, everything you type will be placed into a variable(s) until it is no longer needed or saved. the blank document that is created when you open the program is being held in variable until it is saved or deleted. ok. i got long winded. sorry. :) i hope i have helped to shed some light upon variable and the uses and reasons.\\n\\nbased on the fact that students are usually \"afraid\" of variables -either because of their dull names (x) or their arithmetic values, i think an easy way to teach them is using the following very simple scratch scenarion: scratch dialogue where \"answer\" is indeed a variable with a very nice, human-friendly name and an obvious value! my students even got to love the math variables ;)\\n\\ni have taught 3rd graders using scratch before and i have found that starting with a score variable is the easiest way to get them engaged since most of them know what a score is and know what they want it to do ahead of time. there is no hurdle of trying to explain why we want the variable and why it is useful. this also makes it easy to reenforce resetting the variable at the beginning since most students want their score to reset to zero at the beginning.\\n\\ni totally agree, these chat-bot type lessons are also very intuitive for students.\\n\\nthank you all for your response... i would like to add an interesting response to the @scratchedteam tweet about this question (thanks @scratchedteam btw): @karlbarrs \"@scratchedteam i have used variables for the usual \\'lives\\' and \\'timers\\' but my favourite use was to give a game variable difficulty :-)\" gathering from the responses, some approaches to variables introduction are: 1. game scenarios: variables as scores/lives in the beginning and timers/difficulty later on 2. the ready-made \"answer\" variable 3. more complex problems like \"clocks\" and \"calculators\"\\n\\n', '10121': 'i found these sensor boards on ebay called pic development board for pic16f877 pic16f877a does anyone know anything about them and could i use

education system worldwide; an idea in its early stages of development but so grand in its ambition that it seeks to eventuate global equality though education and the gift of knowledge. i write to you because as you are i'm a computer enginering working full time with education. i'm responsabile to evaluate and propose solutions with all sort of solutions that involves technology. i am interested in building a relationship with you so eventually we may work together with shared values, i like that you belief that the key to development of human resources lies in universal education and gender equality. when equipped with knowledge, skills and ambition, children can grow up to live happy, empowered lives, and be valuable members of their society. first i would like to introduce our concept: we are a non-profit organisation striving to empower the worlds poorest individuals through advancing educational opportunities. we work on the expansion of education by providing a new approach to the content and delivery of the learning experience, giving knowledge to the less privileged with no previous means of accessing the opportunities now available in the digital age. we are puttind a lesson plan together to use scratch on this platform on which the tools of learning will empower people with the technical language of the future, so we may globalise communication in the digital era. connecting people in the remotest of places with a universal language will not only change lives through impact but change the meaning of equal opportunities. our mission is to educate children in coding and design concepts by engaging them in cutting-edge technology, like raspberry pi, with inspiring projects that are fun and productive; building games of their own designs with javascript, html css and python. we aim to make this learning model a part of the school curriculum to give children the chance in developing countries to work on a universally recognised skill, building their confidence in developing themselves and broadening their career prospects worldwide. we want to build lasting relationships with local communities and encourage everyones engagement in the program. an allocated teacher will be provided for the leading and supervision of the learning development of our students. our continual support will see that individual learning needs are met and that graduates are given the tools they require to utilise their skills as they grow. current education in technology development has discovered a huge weakness that has inhibited the ability to actually understand the concept of how it works. graduates understand how to use technology but not how to build it; coding is the key in advancing both technology as we know it and the people using it. the ever growing needs of the employment market can be met by those with the skill set to take it one step further. this is what we offer. there is a significant difference between consuming information and being confident to develop it. imagine speaking the same language; code, this could be the first step to creating global equality, in terms of opportunity. regardless of where you are, we get you where you want to be. i request the opportunity to communicate directly with you so we can further discuss the processes that are under way with regards to both the business model and applied funding. i would also like to explore how we may potentiate a partnership. kind regards ellen bannerman ebspda@gmail.com\\n\\n\", '50920': \"i am looking to next september and can already

usernames that have already been created on the site, nothing will happen (it will just show an error on the screen). at this time, the only way to change the passwords is to do it manually. however, in the password change screen, you have two options: to change the password to something specific, or to simply prompt the student upon login to change it themselves - which may be the faster option, if you are doing many of these.\\n\\nthank you for the replies. i have about 150 to 200 accounts to reset, i'll start plugging away with resetting them. i think i will do the same and assign the same

this is a valuable difference as well). i have collaborated with classrooms around the world before and found it to be an amazing experience for all involved. this project will be simple. the project for my grade 5 students will have this is our guiding question \\'what makes us canadian?\" and the international class would do the same for thier country. students in the class would create scratch projects about significant historical events, people that have had an impact on their country, key ideas... whtever is in your curriculum. if you are in grade 4 to 12, each student could make a project. younger grades may make a project together as a class. a really exciting part is that we would share a scratch studio. the students would communicate to each other through their projects and through comments. knowing that there is a groups of studetns from another part of the world that they are working with is tremendously exciting for the students. they love to show off their own countries. they also love to make scratch projects! if you understand what i am trying to put together, please comment - send a message - on my scratch account: \\'lgmeloche\\' . hope to work with you

their own. i\\'m looking for more advanced projects for them to try. we don\\'t need tutorials; we need problems to solve, or project specifications and rubrics, things like that. \"bouncing music

need an incredible team some financial support ($50k to give you an idea) to get it done. so it will only happen if we find enough reaons to gather again, a nice location, and ... scratch2013bcn.org was announced around christmas 2012, leavinf us with around 8 months to organize it. it\\'s highly preferred to make the announcement earlier. if you have an idea about where this conference should take place, if you have more than 1 month of spare time the upcoming year, if you know of a theme to focus on, ... please share your thoughts. the only thing i can guarantee about this is that if the discussions doesn\\'t take off, it won\\'t happen :-( i\\'ll start with some of my thoughts best regards, joek\\n\\nthe main reason for organizing scratch2013bcn was to bring the extremely warming 2012 conference to europe. and the original suggestion made at the 2012 conference was to use the odd years for conferences on other continents. thinking that way: incheon (korea) or bangalore (india) would be great places to give much more asians access to the nice event a scratchconference is. this, however will only work if someone from the area stands up and takes the lead. a lot of europeans truly enjoyed the barcelona conference and if a lot of people are in favour of another european edition i\\'m totally happy to take the lead. another citilab edition will benefit largely from the experience in 2013 and is a good option (i love the place!) reaching out to eastern parts of europe is also a good idea. places coming to mind: berlin, austria, budapest, ... and then there\\'s a third option mentioned by brian harvey: berkeley, california. i assume such a place will be attractive to asians, americans and europeans alike ...\\n\\nhi joek --- thanks for taking the initiative on this. i was thinking about it, and bangalore weather will just not be good in june/july. so i think the options should be somehwere in europe or berkeley.\\n\\ni went to barcelona last year, and i had one of my best times ever. the citilab was just a perfect spot in my opinion. there are a newborn interest in scratch, coding and education in sweden at the moment, so somewhere in europe would be absolutely fantastic. of course i would love to go to berkeley ca, but it might be to expensive. berlin is another fantastic town, but citilab might be even better. i really want to go to barcelona (why not 5 days ?:) it\\'s all about collaboration and socialisation). keep up the good work with bringing scratchconference to europe.\\n\\ni agree that barcelona was an amazing venue! i saw some mention of tokyo on twitter and thought that was a wonderful idea as well!\\n\\nhello everyone i was just looking at the slide summary from the last conference in barcelonahttp://creativecomputerlab.com/scratchconf2013.pdf they sure covered an amazing amount of stuff and all very exciting stuff too! :) i would be interested in helping out with the next conference if it is in europe (or canada but i think you\\'re looking for a place outside of north america).  it would really be helpful for someone to outline what the needs are, so i have a clear understanding of what that might entail. i\\'ve never been involved in hosting or helping organize a conference before, so maybe this would be way beyond my abilities. :) i live in switzerland, but usually spend my summers in canada but i can be \"wherever\" really, if it is summer time. how do we go about chosing a venue (a country)? does someone just volunteer a venue and what does the venue have to provide in terms of rooms, exhibitions halls, it infrastructure...? is is expected that the venue be offered free of charge? sorry for the questions. you can tell i\\'m a detail-oriented person. :) ~vivian\\n\\nthe delegation of the great maghreb scratch represented by the organization eim \" for excellent computing teaching\" was present in barcelona and we presented an idea on what is happening in tunisia and attempts to attract the intention of algeria and morocco on the benefits of teaching scratch for children. this summer we\\'re not able to be present due to distance and travel cost. we strongly suggest opting for an eurpean country in 2015. thanks for the good times in barcelona :)\\n\\nfirst of all, thanks a lot for all the compliments! although we think it\\'d be more interesting to spread the scratch movement to other locations, we\\'ll be happy to offer the citilab to host the scratch conference again, if needed. the citilab has a commitment with the scratch family, and it will we a pleasure for us to help organize the scratch conference 2015.\\n\\nevery now and then i got an email with suggestions/questions/etc. on the 2015 conference. once again, you better share your thoughts here as it\\'s not me who takes decisions i can take a decision like scratch2013bcn, but so can you emails to me don\\'t work for community building scratch2013bcn was a community effort, see the organizers page scratch2013bcn depended strongly on private persons making donations (and for sure i don\\'t want to ask these people again) i think on the possibillity of a conference daily. was thinking of doing an opne invitation for organizers meeting in amsterdam mid november or in berlin during wipsce5-7 november. but first i want to have sponsorships for approx $25000, so i\\'m sure we can do without a deficit. i applied for google rise funding, pray your buddha. as for places i reduced my options to barcelona, amsterdam and berlin. you need to know the town a little (and have strong local partners) to set up a conference in a friendly afforable sphere (i.e. oppostite of venet organizers / conference center kind of meeting). once again, other cities may equally qualify but should bring their own lead organizer. there\\'s no rule that says next conference is in europe. there will beasian scratcher forum at 8 november, korea (info?) if the people present there manage to form a team for an asian scratch conference next summer i\\'ll happily postpone european initiative to 2017. same goes for a snap-invites-scratch-fest on us west coast. please make some noise here so people can see it\\'s worth their time to start organizing. joek\\n\\nand maybe the scratch minded people present at mozilla fest should spend a coffe break on this matter!\\n\\ni had a wonderful time at mit this summer and i really love the idea of having another scratch conference on 2015, so you can count on me to help in anyway. jess m.\\n\\nhi, i\\'m sorry i couldn\\'t make it to barcelona last year. this time i\\'m willing to participate, and to help out if i can be of any help. it\\'d be difficult for me to reach places outside europe or the us (east coast). but i\\'ll keep me posted with your work. best.\\n\\ni want to organize a scratch conference in amsterdam second half of august. that\\'s either august 12-15 or august 26-29 (the in between week the city is expecting 1.5 million visitors for sail2015 which drives hotel rates to unaffordable.). we need external funding of  25.000 that\\'s dirt cheap if you remember what scratch2013bcn.org

me know what i can do from nyc! i will likely come because it was just so wonderful even though i am not a world traveler - for scratch - anything! especially as this move to learn to code grows, it

tatiana shevchenko rosemary slattery richard smyth barbara tennyson sabita verma daniel watt recap: networking and scheduling:  after an informal gathering around our food table with coffee, juice, fruit, and bagels, we introduced ourselves and shared what we were thinking about on our way to the meetup. there was an overwhelming consensus that people were excited about learning more about scratch as well as learning how educators are using it in their classrooms and other venues. others were just pleased that it was a beautiful day in cambridge. all 25 of us then contributed a collection of post-it notes with topic requests. adam and barbara accepted the challenge of grouping the notes and created our agenda for the day. breakout sessions: two sets of 45 minute sessions were planned. in the first session we held a google hangout with the scratched meetup concurrently being held in lexington, ky. (janet and leanna had planned this ahead of time.) a big thank you to maheen for starting the hangout and providing the tech confidence. we enjoyed hanging out on a saturday morning with wonderful educators from kentucky. rosemary and adam led a hands-on introduction to scratch with a maze project and a pen tool project. richard brought his hangman project for help and inspiration. the group had great discussions around computer science content. the scratch projects were very popular and many continued to work on them through the second session. carmelo helped barbara and willa try out the little bits with scratch. lorraine led a group looking at ways scratch can make global connections. lunch discussions: the enthusiastic conversations continued over lunch. we shared some projects and announcements (see below). shout outs: our harvard interns who joined us today. carmelo from the mit media lab llkg for his help with the little bits. leanne prater and all the educators from lexington ky for joining us remotely. announcements: you can follow scratchedteam on instagram and twitter (@scratchedteam) europe code week was held last week. find resources at codeweek.eu everyone is encouraged to join the csta greater boston group to receive information about workshops, job postings, and much more. here are the links to the hangman projects: hangman by rsmyth, and thinking about hangman by ssbb. here is the link to the scratch meetup maze by rslattery529 our meetup schedule for the year is set. to find the dates and to register go to our eventbrite page. our next meetup is november 7.\\n\\n', '19113': \"i have not yet been able to login to the creative computing online workshop. can someone direct me on how to do it?

* how does art inspire you to think about technology in new ways?\\n\\ntechnology is anothermedium to creatively communicate information, beauty, andemotions through art. technology allows people to participate and engage in art. rosemary\\n\\ntechnology has the ability to allow people who don\\'t think of themselves as talented in the traditional sense of an artist, to create amazing and beautiful pieces with the aid of technological resources. in schools, it can act as an equalizer for those students who don\\'t always shine in the classroom.\\n\\ntechnology and art were not traditionally thought of as complementary. when i thought art, i immediately think of paint and museums. when i thought technology, i think of software/hardware/productivity and then gaming, internet and interactive programs. david\\'s projects pointed me in a totally different way. the nobel fields was an artist wonder. the technology was the art form that made the historical information pleasurable and intriguing. i was inspired by the word well and the holocaust museum\\'s interactive participation. i do not consider myself traditionally artistic with paint, although i love to color. i feel that technology medium can level the playing field and make us all \"artists\" in the true sense of the word.\\n\\nsince i\\'m not really an artist (although i can be creative), technology helps me create works of art. it gives me tools to do things i never imagined. it empowers me the artist in me. i can be more creative and am able to think about creating in new ways. i can combine media and end up with a product i never imagined. technology helps express my ideas and thoughts. if i look at art as a starting point and consider how it inspires me to think about technology, i realize that i can interact with works of art -- reinterpret them using technology; i can examine them at a pixel level -- understand technique and mastery; i can explore mathematical relationships -- examine perspective and proportions, etc.; i can use art as a focal point for exploring technology and its tools. if i think about it long enough it seems impossible to separate the two ... like an escher drawing ... the art inspires technology and the technology inspires art. (the pen draws the hand which draws the pen which draws the ..... )\\n\\ni am facinated by the connections between mathematical ideas and art. i think technology helps us to see those connections. it is also inspiring to see how technology can be beautiful and the ways that art can inspire technological form and function. to really answer this question i would need to define art and define technology. if technology is any tool, then the creation of any art requires some kind of technology like a pencil or a paintbrush. if i define art as a product of human creativity then everything we have done with scratch is art - as it has requred a fair amount of creativity on my part to create my projects.\\n\\ntechnology has always been part of the art making process! jiove.com/process/phase2/lascaux_horse.jpg the lascaux cave painter, whoever he or she was, had to figure out how to make his/her media (mineral-based pigments, carving tools, etc) using whatever materials were available 16,000 years ago. these were state of the art technology at the time. plaster, marble, bronze, oil paint, photography, motion pictures, and plastics were all \"new media\" once. now that there are expensive museums full of artworks made with these media, it\\'s easy for us to think of them as more \"real\" or \"serious\" than other kinds of work. i still love working by hand, and i think traditional drawing is a valuable skill to teach students. there are a million ways to combine the traditional and digital arts - for example, you can sketch a pencil drawing, scan it and clean it up in photoshop, print it out and retrace it in ink, scan it again and color it in photoshop, then print it out to a high-quality color printer. or whatever you like. i\\'m interested in helping students break down the arbitrary division between the physical art object and the digital image.\\n\\n\"if technology is any tool, then the creation of any art requires some kind of technology like a pencil or a paintbrush.\" from liz davis inever thought of art using technology in this way, but this is a great example. many people think that technology is just about computers (at least my students think that), but you are right that the tools used in art are technology. scratch can integrate art into the techology class and i think it can help students who might not think they are good at art have a medium that they can be successful with.\\n\\nart is generally part of the physical world and its creation involves interacting with or acting on that world, but what makes a particular act or product art and another not? as technologies expand, the possibilities for art expand. hopefully, visual design is an important part of engineering and constructing using the technologies at hand (of everything that we create and live with). i agree that there is value and satisfaction in \"traditional\" methods like drawing, but it is great to also see innovation. as a librarian, i really like the feel of a book, the binding, end-papers, fonts, even the smell-all those tactile qualities. but i see the value in the playaway and the kindle, and there value to me would increase if they somehow spoke more to my senses like a book. i see in the media labs we visited, the focus on trying to make the technologies work with the \"human\", sense elements to make the products more appealing. bravo.\\n\\ni believe that technology does allow access to the discovery of artistic interest and the stimulation of artistic ability. could paint or photoshop late at night in the privacy of your own room be enough to generate the next picasso or spielberg?\\n\\n', '31660': \"i came back from winter break to discover that scratch.mit.edu is now being blocked by opendns at our school. our it director says he can't whitelist anything, because if it's being blocked it must not be cipa compliant. is anyone else having this issue?

damn good question and i loved karen\\'s line: \"some of the things that are easiest to evaluate are not the things we care about.\" the problem is that the things that are easy (ie: quick and inexpensive) and \"fair\" (standarizable across a wide population) to assess are not what i care about. what do i hope kids learning: certain habits of mind that will serve them well in life and make them better citizens. confidence that they can create things they care about. help others how to work with others and build a team explore different ways of knowing/expressing something write it in scratch, javascript, programming another person, etc. balancing churchill and twain never, never, never give up. - winston churchill try, try again, then give up. there no sense making a damn fool of yourself - mark twain note: i like giving kids conflicting suggestions. first it forces them to think. second, it requires them to look for appropriate balances and realize things are not always black and white. try understanding why it works (especially after \"hunting and pecking\" until you get an answer) look for connections things i look for and questions/comments i ask/make toward this end. how is these two things the same and how are they different? how else could you do this? do the simplest thing possible to make it work. then you can refine later. its okay to make mistakes. i expect mistakes. in fact if you arent making mistakes you arent trying hard enough. what can you learn from that mistake? learn from the mistakes of others. you don\\'t have time to make them all yourself. wow thats cool, how did you do that? how did you come up with that idea? what did you try that didnt work? if a student finishes early, ask them to help someone else. part of this is training them to help in a way, that builds up the other students and tries to question them toward an answer, or provide examples or small pieces of code they can look at and try and figure out. that said, sometimes, doing it for them is appropriate. make mistakes on purpose and see what happens. done with text based languages so they can see the error the compiler produces and get a better understanding and appreciation of the error messages. give them: wheres the bug problems. read their code out loud to themselves and imagine/visulize/kineticize (move your hands/body to mimic what the code is doing, good for drawing shapes projects). i tell them reading it out loud helps you slow down and see what your code is really doing, which is often not what you want it to do. (do what i meant, not what i said) its okay to copy (re-use and hopefully re-mix) can you make this a re-usable compoment that you can use in other projects? should you? how is this like (fill in the blank) and how is it not like (fill in the blank) example 1: scratch draft curricullum comparing programming each other how to dance with how its like programming in scratch. example 2: how are these programs, which all do the same thing, but are written in different languages (one in scratch, one in java script and one in squeak) similar and different? i also want to comment on the question that came up towards the end how do you encourage kids to be bold?

the way i see it, the conventional o-o paradigm works fine for each object if you treat spritesasobjects (cloning sprites is similar to instantiating objects of a class). however, it\\'s not so obvious for messages, events and concurrent execution of sprites (objects). for example,interrupts are events, so scratch is helpful to introduce the concept of an interrupt service routine (handler) that runs asynchronously. however, broadcasting messages between objects (tasks?) typically requires some os support. any ideas? are there any resources to map scratch concepts to conventional o-o programming?thanks\\n\\nanswering my own post... there is a good article in the wiki on objects in scratch: wiki.scratch.mit.edu/wiki/object-oriented_programming many other useful articles in category \"computer science\": wiki.scratch.mit.edu/wiki/category:computer_science finally, see snap!, \"an extended reimplementation of scratch that allows you to build your own blocks. it also features first class lists, first class procedures, and continuations. these added capabilities make it suitable for a serious introduction to computer science for high school or college students.\" (snap.berkeley.edu)\\n\\nif you haven\\'t already seen it, you might find this tutorial (for an earlier version of scratch) by david malan interesting.\\n\\nthanks!\\n\\n', '13562': 'hi everyone- if you joined us today at the workshop - thank you! if you couldn\\'t come but would like to contribute your own scratch cards to the channel - thank you! here is the link to the presentation outline. we did have a little glitch at the workshop with overwriting each other\\'s cards and thanks to our new minnesota friends, we think we know why it happened... see the last pages of the presentation that have some final notes. please feel free to be in touch if you have any questions. when school starts this fall, i\\'ll have a new group of animation students, but we\\'ll be in scratch after we do some initial drawing exercises and storyboarding and claymation stop-motion projects so if you\\'re interested in skype video and sharing the process of making and posting scratch cards, we\\'re interested and available to work with you! thanks again mitch and karen and the scratch team for making this \"in real life\" extension possible! scratch card resources presentation\\n\\n', '15852': 'at the january 2013 scratch educator meetup, participants shared ideas for how to facilitate an introductory scratch session with students. ideas for stepping into scratch with students do the about me project (session #2 in the scratch curriculum guide) start by showing awesome examples; then set a manageable project. success on step one! goal-directed simple project with many possible solutions show and use ease of using graphics and sound together. use the scratch cards as a resource. create a program to tell a knock-knock joke. a quick, one-off session to show cool scratch projects and teach the super basics can serve as a \"teaser\" to get kids to sign-up for more longterm scratch commitments. you have to have a hook - show them all the cool things you can create and do using scratch. using some of the first activities in the scratch curriculum guide can be a good way to introduce kids to the basics of scratch! what ideas do you have?

(about a particular aspect of the project) what did you get stuck on? what are you most proud of? what will you do next with your project? think about a project you\\'ve worked on since you arrived -- and respond to one (or several) of these questions in the comments. sincerely, karen, on behalf of the creative computing organizing team\\n\\nin the flash mob project i wanted to have multiple characters but i wanted them to use the same script. except for the move to their starting positions, their scripts are the same. i was able to test out one sprite, duplicate it, and then just change it\\'s colors and it\\'s starting position.\\n\\nfor the dance project, i chose to use two sprites that had multiple poses. i wanted to explore combining the poses to make realistic dance moves. i used the ballerina and played with gravity to have her jump and land gracefully. i used the boy dancer and made him attempt a moonwalk. i got stuck on moving the boy convincingly. next i would like to record one dancers moves and have another imitate it (like our bossy/bossed exercise).\\n\\nin the dance party project, ihad a dance contest. each contestant was identified by a, b or c. the project required the user to press one of the letters to make the contestant dance on the stage. iused the x/y coordinates to glide the sprite from the original postion to the stage to dance then return to their original position. the contest moderator stated the directions to the audience. a challenge that ihad, and still have, iwant the sprite to grow when it is on the stage, then return to original size when it returns to original starting position. my challenge is that i don\\'t want the sprite to get too big.\\n\\ni also created a flash mob scene, each script was the same but i changed the \"wait\" period on each of them. after i finished it, my neighbor shared with me that it would have been easier to to use \"broadcast\" tiles. i learned something new! :-)\\n\\nfor this project i created a simple scenario of a ballerina jumping and gliding in a ballet studio. next i would like to add several sprites and choreograph a ballet sequence.\\n\\nat first i was thinking of a specific piece of music that i thought would need sort of an african scene. since i didn\\'t find something satisfactory in the library, i ended up using a desert scene and changed the song to \"summertime\" sung by billie holiday. my sprite was a grasshopper in the desert and my biggest challenge was timing him to jump at the point in the music where \"fish are jumpin\\'\" happens. this happened during the instrumental introduction and my plan was/is to change to a water scene with fish jumping (using mulitple sprites) when the actual lyrics came in.\\n\\nin my dance party project i wanted to have two sprites dancing alongside one another. i got stuck quite a bit. learning some of the basics such initial variables and switching backgrounds was important. if i were to add onto this project or do it again, i would have the sprites interact more, perhaps in a dance battle rather than simultaneously. i think using the broadcast command would allow me to do this.\\n\\nwhat are you most proud of? what will you do next with your project? i did the dancing lobster project. i am proud of successfully controling size and location of the lobster sprite. in particular, setting initial conditions. next, i want to change the one red lobster dancing to a chorus line of lobsters (maybe different colors) dancing.\\n\\ni am currently collaborating on a project to introduce the power of scratch to both teachers and students. the inspiration for the project came from the idea of forming a computer science advocacy group (using scratch). ijust started the project, so i am still in the design stage of the program. but i did get the curtains to open up! what ihope to do, is to have words scrawl up on the stage, explain the importance of scratch and then demonstrate different math skills via the use of manipulatives.... and then who knows. i am finding talking and sharing with other teachers at the workshop to be very inspirational (and at times a tad bit intimidating :))\\n\\nmy project was to animate some photos of the swivel chairs we are sitting on. i am fairly new to scratch so i got stuck on keeping the sprites where i wanted them to be. my neighbor was very patient and helpful with my questions. i learned a lot from her. next i would like to trim the music file i have to fit the short animation. i was inspired by watching the shared animations from the group.\\n\\nthe inspiration for my project was our location. looking at the city and the river reminded me of the song dirty water. one obstacle i occurred was finding the song and then downloading it. once that was done and it was attached to the stage, i found that it was much too long (3 minutes). i then had to find an editor, free of course, that would allow me to edit the song to a shorter length. with the new shorter version of the song in place, i then had to readjust the number of repeats for each of my sprites so that everything ended at once. this type of project is one that i can see using in my classroom next year.\\n\\nfor my dance project, i wanted to attempt to draw someone and try to animate a dance move. since i can\\'t draw, i made a stick figure, but was successful in creating an animation. i initially got stuck on creating another sprite in a different position, but got help from a neighbor on how to use costumes. i wanted to try and synchronize the movements with the music. i was able to do that playing with the wait times between costume changes. finally, a neighbor suggested i use broadcast to synch the start of the second peice of music between my two sprites. that worked great! thanks!\\n\\nfor my dance project, i did a standard one sprite dance sequence. what i found difficult was making my code more concise. the script window gets cluttered pretty quickly. i tried to use the broadcast and receive feature as a way to create subroutines so i could partition sections of code in a more manageable way. i also had to remember to initialize several attributes of the scene and sprite at the start of the program.\\n\\niam currently building a pong game and i am stuck on bouncing the ball. this is the most complex component of pong. once this is complete, ican add the other features (such as points, player names, animation, etc). another question i can answer is my inspiration for pong. when i first started programming in 1996, my professor in college gave us a homework assignment(that\\'s right...i said a homework assignment) to create a fully functional pong using the java programming environment. i spent approximate 20-30 hours coding and making my pong game. it looked horrible, but it worked.thus, i feel that it would be poetic to create a new pong game, with nicer features using scratch.\\n\\nin my dance project, i wanted the 2nd character to appear later (about 15 seconds in). i couldn\\'t figure out how to have char2 come into the picture. i learned to use hide and show commands as well as broadcast. the broadcast command was with char1. for example, char2 \\'shows\\' whenchar1 asks \\'who?\\' char2 has to receive the command. it really makes you think about every little detail, the order of operations, and the logic of \\'if\\' this, \\'then\\' that.\\n\\nin eld dance party, i got my background inspiration from looking out the window and seeing the water of the charles river with boats sailing by. i decided to make my dance party on the beach. i wanted to have a boy and girl sprite that each had multiple costumes that i could utilize. i am challenged by getting the sound to work exactly as i would like. i wanted each dancer to have their own music to move by but i\\'m still haven\\'t gotten it to perform as i would like.\\n\\nfor the dance project i didn\\' t want a program that people simply watched, but i wanted them to interact with it and have the program respond to their action. i found an existing program sample in scratch called \"ocean music box\" which had this sort of interaction. i used that program to create a dance project where the sprites can be moved on the screen by the user. the music changes depending on where on the screen the sprites are placed. i then started working on a new project that uses the pens and would like to incorporate the interactie drawing and the music into one program eventually.\\n\\nfor my dance project i was trying to recreate the \"zorba the greek\" dance. i spent most of my time downloading a program so i could get the music off youtube. when i finally did that, i was able to import the music. if ihad more time i would have probably created my own characters with multiple costumes, but i worked with one of the available sprites.i learned how to edit and reflect a sprite so that he could dance in different ways. ithen wanted to add in another person and have them holding hands and dancing, but i didn\\'t have time to make the second sprite pose the same. so i was able to accomplish about 1/2 of what i set out to do. i did learn a bunch of new things in the art session!\\n\\ninteractive boston skyline xylophone what was your inspiration for this project? iwas impressed yesterday by the view out of our conference room. this morning we were asked to think about arts-related ideas. seemed fun to take the image of the skyline and art-ify or music-ify it. how did you do that? (about a particular aspect of the project) i experimented with several ways of triggering the music. in both cases, the taller buildings in the skyline photo are the \"keys\" of a keyboard. my original intent was to have some type of controllable graphic \"pointer\" slide left and right across the buildings (using a picoboard). igot a bit stuck at first, so tried an easier version triggered by the mouse pointer. the \"if\" and \"touching _______\"blocks were important to make this work. what did you get stuck on? the picoboard version still has some bugs. when the pointer-ball is rolled over a building, it is not triggering a musical note. what are you most proud of? i had a goal to try using the picoboard, so this was one attempt. what will you do next with your project? try to get it working. ask for some feedback from one of the music educators here. (who are you again?)\\n\\nmy neighbor was also helpful in showing me about broadcast!\\n\\nwhat are you most proud of? it bothered me how static the sprites looked as i moved them. i heard someone at another table say something about changing an arm on a sprite and that started me exploring possibilities. with the help of people at my table (thanks all) i was able to make the dog\\'s ears pop up as he jumped then down again when he dropped back (via a costume change). ahhhhh....the endless possibilities! which brings up a big issue: i\\'m a content teacher and somehow i need to keep students\\' focus on the key content goal of any scratch projects. i\\'m thinking collaboration with the art teacher or other specialists might be a way to deal with this issue.\\n\\nmy inspiration for my dance project was realistic dance movement in a mtv video style environment. the project was completed by using two main spriets dancing with a consistently changing background. my biggest challenge was getting the dancers to move in a realistic fashion and this was a matter of coordinating the timing, changing of costumes, and waits. i\\'m most proud that iwas able to accomplish the dance movements somewhat realistically. i wish to continue the dance project. (iactually wrote \"dance project\"in my porject ideas this morning). ilike the flash mob creation. i want to create sprites and coodinate the movements of the sprites in non dance related environment. the challenge here so far is creating the sprites. at first ithought to create in photoshop but thought that i should try to create using a medium that my students will have access to. so, i \\'m trying to create sprites in scratch.\\n\\ni think my next step is to learn how to remix using how other projects; i\\'m inspired by what others have done so far using scratch in the timing of different kinds of motion. sadly, yesterday was my first day actually using the application and so as i\\'m learning more about the higher level functions - i\\'m curious on what i can do next. i really want to explore operators, variables, and pen to develop animations or game projects. the duplication of scripts with other sprites helped me with my beach dance party project. ispent the late part of the morning looking through the projects in the scratched resources area for ideas and its really cool to see the curricular connections. besides the fact that scratch enhances computational thinking - i\\'m always trying to make the connections to different subject areas.\\n\\ni wanted one dancer to do specific moves. chose the sprite then made 8 costumes by copying,,,editing...and mirror imaging. worked harder than i had to by not doing those steps in a logical order so i had to make a table to keep track of the moves. then john presented his project and demo\\'d the random costume. my \"control-freak\" tendencies were dashed! (i copied the project and changed it to random...looked just as good.) got stuck on positioning the sprite and making him stay put. set x works wonders. i also didn\\'t pick up on the distinction between the costume number and costume name i.e. costume # 1 is dan2. favorite thing i learned today was the duplicate stamp.\\n\\nwhat was your inspiration for this project? iwanted to do something different - never had uploaded a song, wanted two things to do something simultaneously, and i wanted some random aspect. also, i like jungles and monkeys. how did you do that? (about a particular aspect of the project) found my song on google, downloaded it and uploaded to my project. what did you get stuck on? my song sounded ok off of my desktop but lousy on scratch. for some reason though, it sounded fine when i uploaded it to the scratch site. what will you do next with your project? after walking around the room, i am inspired to use pen and sound more. i want to create a scratch that has the user choose an instrument and then somehow write their name and each letter or position creates a different note. when played, that is what your name sounds like. we\\'ll see...\\n\\nwhat was the inspiration for this project? daning queen & dancing quees2 just before attending this workshop i ran through the scratch tutorials on the homepage. along with the themed inspirations of the sessions i added/remix-ed my own projects from the ones created from the tutorials. what are you most proud of...? yesterday i applied what rivka taught me (using a go to script) to my new project and to assit a colleague.\\n\\nthe inspiration was to use a number of different sprites on a background. each sprite would do something different and maybe interact in some fashion. i got stuck when i started using a sprite which already had scripts insluded. i thought changing them would be easier than starting from the beginning. it did work for 1 sprite but was more complicated for the 2nd one. i learned a lot fixing the 2nd one. i was proud that i was able to find a way to keep one away from the other by moving sprite 1 to another part of the screen when they got too close. the next time i will add a 3rd sprite.\\n\\ni uploaded my party project. my inspiration for the project was this morning\\'s class demo (ihave no previous scratch experience). iadded 4 sprites to a stage that used the spotlight-stage as the background. for each sprite, iincluded multiple customes to be able to make them dance. ithen set the stage to play music and to broadcast a start message when the space key was pressed. each sprite would dance and then broadcast a message for the next sprite. to the stage, i added the \"when the m key is pressed\" stop all. iwas stuck in getting the broadcasting to work correctly for a while. to get it to work, i used a variable as a switch. i am most proud of getting it to work \"just the way that iwanted\" i would like to be able to import my own sound file and also have a message on the stage that instructs the user on using the enter and m keys. iwould like the message to then disappear. this was great fun and i can\\'t wait to use it with the kids!!\\n\\ni wanted to create an interactive dance presentation where the user selected a series of steps simply pressing a key. the hope is that once you have a multiple of steps saved, then you can make the character dance to any song. that is future direction of this project.\\n\\ninspiration in my dancing project, i wanted to incorporate multiple spinning sprites. i decided to take a picture of my friend, crop the picture, and make a sprite out of his head. i then duplicated his his head several times. i placed the sprites in the corners of the project and had them spin into each other. the four sprites came together and created a stick figure that had my friend\\'s head. then the stick figure began to dance. what are you most proud of? i have been trying to use variables in prior projects but had no success. in this project, i was able to successful incorporate a variable count that allowed me to make all the heads (sprites) disappear at a specifically designed point in the animation. i did not have to rely on timing, which made the animation go much smoother.\\n\\ni really had no inspiration. i just wanted something that was going to be fun, maybe to \"hook kids\" into the possibilities when using scratch. flashy colors, cool music are ways to get kids excited about something new. i got stuck trying to sequence random costumes i\\'m proud of how i was able to make the sequence entertaining i want to do a project on playing or listening to music notes.\\n\\nmy inspiration for the dance project was gardening. this idea came from the trading cards from the first evening and was provoked by browsing the background images inscratch. i was surprised that there were no flower images, so i had to find one online(i didn\\'t spend much time on this task). i was interested in learning how to make scratch communicate between objects (broadcast and receive).\\n\\ndance party was fun and it was great to have the group to help with issues that they were struggling with and for others to give me ideas.\\n\\nmy requirements: i wanted my sprites to do different kinds of dance moves. what i did: to do this, i chose different sprites and used the different costumes for each sprite. i got stuck on using the thinking bubbles and orienting the bubble to show up where i want it to. next, i will make my sprites move as they do the dance moves.\\n\\nthe last project that i worked on was the dance party project. i love the idea that it takes two people to dance. i remember the block parties that we had as i was growing up. this project reminded me of thoes days.\\n\\nthe about me project what was your inspiration for this project? me, i am amazing. jk. how did you do that? (about a particular aspect of the project) the loudness variable reads your scream/noise and broadcasts a variable when the loudness condition has been met. what did you get stuck on? having the broadcast variable for each shoe hide/show the appropriate images given the coordinate of the mouse click. idid not know scratch could read which sprite was clicked. what are you most proud of? that it is a bit interactive and makes you scream. also, that almost every image is from my library of pictures and makes it unique.\\n\\nthat is a big issue. i will be introducing scratch to content teachers in the fall and i know they will have the same concerns. but, you wrote that you were bothered until you figured out how to customize your sprite and the students will be too if they don\\'t get time to learn that as well. one suggestion, since they can download scratch to their home computer you can leave the customizing to home time and work on the subject content in school.\\n\\ni think using a variable countdown for this project is great. you could make it interactive by asking the program user how long should each sprite dance and then assigning the answer to your variable. play with variable sliders too,\\n\\ngreat idea. it could definitely work.\\n\\ni wanted to design a game program that was challenging and interesting to create. i had trouble with some sequencing ( having things happen at the right time) and also i used the green flag as a way to play the game again which was not a good idea because i couldn\\'t figure out if the program was running for the first time (need to initialize the high score) or if it was just another attempt (keep the high score). i ended up using the space bar to signal another attempt. i want to add the ability to have multiple players and add difficulty levels.\\n\\ni was a new user of scratch and had to get my head around designing a project. i went with the notion of making two stick people and building on the two original figures by copying and pasting them to form a party. i then began to add faces with different colors. i found the process to be confusing at first but with help from my fellow teachers i finished the project.\\n\\ni was making a scratch to introduce my self to the group. it seemed a bit boring having a sprite narrate the story so, dancing seemed a perfect fit. i got a few laughs and it made it more memorable. it was lots of fun making it with a dancing element.\\n\\n', '18621': \"hi, does anybody know how to sign up for the pd online course about scratch ?

(as well as bringing back great memories!) now, where\\'s that webcam...?\\n\\nthanks for sharing this test link! i just created a test project \"blumenwiese\" testing parameterized custom blocks. it worked!! small things: - in ie, the \"see inside\" button doesn\\'t work (when i click on a project thumbnail, i get to the project page, but theni can\\'t get to the scripts). so i used chrome, and that worked. - i was looking for a save button for some time until i realized that there is some autosave going on, and occasionally, i see \"projects needs saving\". same with notes/credits. fine with me, but it takes some getting used to. - when i clicked on make block for the very first time, no define-block template appeared and i was stuck.only when i accidentally clicked on costumes and then on scripts again, the template suddenly appeared. from then on, it always appeared after making a block. - when the project was ready, i clicked on share, but on the project page it still said \"not shared\" over the stage. only when i got to the page next time through my stuff, it appeared as shared. - the button for \"my stuff\" is tiny, and i didn\\'t recognize it as the \"my stuff\" button. i found it by try and error (tooltip would help). - when i changed the language from english to german, acustom blockparameternamed \"color\" was autotranslated to \"farbe\". this kind of localization is a bit too much, i think. also, when i changed back to english, the parameter itself went back to \"color\" but its use in the custom block definition remained \"farbe\". that\\'s it for now - i\\'ll keep testing! bernd.\\n\\nyes i was scratching, pardon the pun, my head last night for a while as i couldn\\'t get back to the editor using ie 9 as \"see inside\" doesn\\'t work. chrome also has problems as \"see inside\"doesn\\'t work occasionally on that. it makes the whole process really hard to get into a project and edit it. \"create\" confusingly for me just dumps you into presentation mode with the scratch cat and a large green flag but not the editor.\\n\\nok, i still don\\'t understand how saving/editing works. i have this shared test project, and nowiupdate it by deleting one script. i see \"save needed\" but don\\'t click on it. after some more clicking in the interface, i see \"saved at 19:47:52\", and clicking on the green flag indeed shows the effect of the update.but when i click on \"my stuff\" and from there go back to the project, i\\'m still seeing the old version before the update. which is good, since i don\\'t want autosave to mess with my shared stuff. but how do i nowshare the update? and how do istore intermediate changes during the update process, for examplewhen i need to logoff and want to continue later?\\n\\ni\\'m enjoying trying out scratch 2.0! here are a few things i\\'ve noticed: the clone blocks are very useful - i can really see people making great use of these. i like the higher resolution of the graphics. the backpack is incredibly useful for sharing sprites bewteen projects. this used to be a laborious process before. i can see this being very useful in a classroom situation. the saving process is not obvious at the start. there is obviously some autosaving going on, but there is no prominent save button. perhaps it\\'s a bit old fashioned but i like the old style disc icon to click when i\\'ve got something to work after a while. it sort of marks the end of that bit of the project and, after clicking, i know i can move onto the next bit, secure that my work is saved! i also noticed (see mark willis post) that the create button takes me straight to the full screen presentation mode. however, if i go to one of my projects and then click see inside it works fine. then i can click on new and i get the proper editor view with all the blocks etc. (this was using the up to date google chrome) i\\'ll keep testing!\\n\\ni tested recursion with custom blocks (fibonacci numbers) - it works! the only unfortunate thing is that there are no custom reporters which makes the code a bit cumbersome. also, have comments diappeared? i can\\'t find them anywhere, and loading a scratch 1.4 project from disk renders them as a red (obsolete?) blocks. i\\'ll keep testing! bernd.\\n\\ni noticed that the german translations of blocks and their categories are incomplete. for blocks / categories that have been present in scratch 1.4, one should simply choose the old german names. for new blocks and categories, i don\\'t know whether names have been discussed / decided yet. here\\'s the natural proposal for some of them: - data -> daten - more blocks -> mehr bl_cke - events -> ereignisse - create clone of ... -> erzeuge klon von ... - delete this clone -> l_sche diesen klon - clone startup -> klon-aktivierung - stop all / this script / other scripts in sprite - > stoppe alles / dieses skript / andere skripte dieses objekts i\\'m happy to help with translations of others, if needed. while going through all this, i noticed that the actual blocks shown in the alpha differ from what the \"how do i use the new blocks?\" section says. most notably, the backdrop capabilities seem more rstricted than what the scene blocks advertise (for example, there\\'s no ...and wait feature). are the alpha blocks supposed to be the scratch 2.0 blocks, or are there still changes to be expected? thanks and all the best, bernd.\\n\\nsome intial thoughts: a / block would be very useful - i had to create confusing code to mimic it (http://alpha.scratch.mit.edu/projects/10005645) paint editor: this is a huge improvement, i especially like theline point manipulation if you duplicate a defined block (in trying to copy it elsewhere), you can\\'t then delete the duplicate by dragging into the script block area. you get two identically named blocks in \\'more blocks\\' area (both of which call the first code you created). you can delete the duplicate by right-clicking. you can delete the definition of a block by right-clicking and pressing delete, even if it has been used in the script. you cannot delete it by dragging it into the script block area if it is in use. you don\\'t seem to be able to drag code into the stage script area from a sprite will it be possible to make a defined block available to all sprites: i have written a \\'walk\\' block but can\\'t let other sprites use it. this seems like a huge issue to me. have code comments gone? it is looking great! i can\\'t wait to show my students and teachers. more soon... rebecca\\n\\n1st imediate thoughts/impressions big one - still all online - which is great for sharing but really need an off-line version for classroom teaching as internet access not reliable enough during 1st 10mins of using it - my shockwave plugin crashed in chrome :( (i use chrome in my schools as available across xp and win7 and gives biggest working area on netbooks) stage size control - on netbooks - this is used oftern and not sure it should be pushed back from a button to a menu option. went to draw a sprite, no undo button/clear/redo/zoom ???? - cirlce drawing seems a bit wrong - circle doesn\\'t \"start\" from correct point - vector graphics great for me but i think younger scratchers still going to need a simple bit-mapped paint option. (understand warnings that its buggy btw) could do with tool-tips. can\\'t see the much asked for x to the power y maths function or even x squared function - but surely it must be in there :) drop down selection has issues if the dropdown list hits the bottom of the screen - can\\'t cleanly select an item - have to click and hold instead of just clicking. regards simon\\n\\njust went to try and save - there is no save option!!!! save is a fundemental it concept that i think all educators try and impart to pupils - i think we should be able to \"save\" and then \"share\" if required. but do like the ability to restore work from the trash bin - very nice :) simon\\n\\nhi karen, how long have we got for our testing before we lose access? thanks! rebecca\\n\\nthis isn\\'t a limited-time trial, so your access should stay intact.\\n\\none change that i\\'ve been asking for doesn\\'t seem to have made it into scratch 2 yet :) but i\\'ll give it another go because i\\'m all about ease of use for little scratchers :) when moving a sprite around on the stage to decide a starting or ending position it would be really, really nice if the goto x y and glide to x y blocks automatically updated to the sprites position when a scratcher drags it around the screen. it would be sufficient to just update the values when the mouse button is released at the end of a drag operation. this saves having to double-click a sprite to get updated x/y co-ords and not requiring double-click skills which would (using lightnin\\'s phrase :) ) lower the floor for using scratch as afaik nothing else requires it. regards simon\\n\\nthe \"fuzzy\" project saving/loading/editing is really not working for me. i don\\'t mind the project being auto-saved but i\\'m really struggling to work out how to re-open and make changes to an existing project - i just can\\'t work out how to do it! :( simon\\n\\nopening/saving ok - been playing/ thinking a bit more - would other primary (\\n\\nme neither (see my cxomments below). would be happy about any help!\\n\\n1. maybe it is just me, but sprites seem to move faster in 2.0. for a game, i used a loop with \"move 2 steps\" and \"wait 0.01 sec\". in 1.4 it takes the sprite about 6 seconds to move across the playing area but only 4 seconds in 2.0. did anyone else experience this?? 2. i really like the ability to make the scripts larger and smaller, but how about the blocks themselves? it\\'s not as critical but it would be nice. 3. in 1.4 it was possible to save scripts as images. this is essential because we use it to create learning materials by creating projects and then documenting them in various ways in an external document. moti\\n\\nhi again, there also seems to be a change in the positioning of \"say\" and \"think\" blocks relative to the sprites. i (think i) shared a project \"worm arithmetic\" which is a game for learning arithmetic. the \"answers\" are no longer positioned very close to the \"worms\" making it hard to decipher which answer is associated with which worm. moti\\n\\nsuper weird: i have a project from 1.4 that works perfectly ok in 2.0 as long as i run it in full-screen but doesn\\'t work from the small pane. it is an implementation of parity-checking from \"computer science unplugged\". i shared it and you can download it from:http://code.google.com/p/scratch-unplugged/. when run in the small pane, the random number generator isn\\'t random anymore (!)and the computations of coordinates are occasionally wrong. moti\\n\\nhi moti, this (ans also the speed issue) have less to do with scratch 2.0 than with the flash player that is in use on the regular scratch website already now, and for quite some time now. i never saw this small pane bug above, though, that\\'s really weird.\\n\\nthanks for all of the great feedback, everyone! for specific questions, you might want to also check out the scratch 2.0 forums. i find the search featureparticularlyuseful for finding relevant content.\\n\\nhi bernd, thanks for the clarification, but since i\\'m just a \"user\" of scratch, the distinction isn\\'t really relevant.i just looked at the stats and there are close to 3m projects (!), so backward compatibility is critical. moti\\n\\nconcerning my post from yesterday about saving scripts, this also goes for what was called \"save picture of stage\". i used one project to generate a stage (for a karel robot) and then saved it for use in another project. aside from the issues i raised, scratch 2 works great. next week, i\\'ll try a big test: converting a byob project that defined a lot of blocks to scratch 2. (see http://code.google.com/p/scratch-robotics/ if you\\'re interested.)i\\'ll post a report on how it went. moti\\n\\nhi karen, i\\'m not sure i understand this post: 1. are you closing this discussion and asking us to use the \"regular\" scratch 2.0 forum instead? 2. will the developers be looking at the bugs i reported here or do you want me to copy them over to the \"bugs and glitches\" forum? thanks in advance for clarifying this! moti\\n\\ni rewrote a byob project for scratch 2 and it works:http://alpha.scratch.mit.edu/projects/10006178 issues that arose during the conversion: 1. as far as i could see,scratch does not support \"folding\" or \"hiding\"the code for new blocks. we have middle-school kids writing projects with dozens of scripts per sprite, some of them very long. it is often impossible to read and understand them and i dread to think what would happen if someone tried to maintain such a project after it wins a prize on scratch day.i was hoping that scratch 2 would use \"make block\" as a way of supporting the structuring of programs.please, please do something! 2. byob supports creating functions returning boolean <...> or number (...). very nice to have but not essential. 3. byob supports remote call of a \"procedure\" in another sprite. there is an easy workaround by broadcasting a message and calling the block when it is received so i don\\'t see this as necessary. 4. something didn\\'t look right and i tracked it down as resulting for my changing the center of rotation of a sprite. i guess that this is to be implemented in the future. i\\'m looking forward to the release! moti\\n\\nno, i\\'m not closing this discussion -- you\\'re welcome to use either space. scratch team members will be looking at both spaces.\\n\\ni strongly agree concerning true/false blocks. we need this to use custom blocks that have a boolean parameter. best, bernd.\\n\\nthanks for the comments and suggestions. 1.we have planned to have \"make a block\" definitions be expandable/collapsible, but it hasn\\'t made it to the top of the priorities yet. i\\'m thinking in a future update (maybe after the 2.0 release). 2.functions returning booleans are not planned in order to keep things simpler. 3. good. 4. the current plan for center of rotation is that it will be the center of the paint editor, though that may still change to an adjustable center. to find out or comment on the latest scratch 2.0 updates and features, you can visit:http://alpha.scratch.mit.edu/forums/1/\\n\\ni\\'m confirming that the scratch design team is reading and appreciates all your comments here! thescratch 2.0 forumsis a good way to follow the latest updates and discussions among all the testers and design team, including using thesearch feature, as karen mentioned.\\n\\nhi moti, do you mind posting the url for the scratch program itself? if you post it in the scratch 2.0 forums bugs and glitches it will have more eyes figuring out the issues. if you\\'d rather post here that\\'s okay to. natalie\\n\\nzooming in on the whole screen is planned soon. save scripts as images is also planned but probably after the 2.0 release. speed issues could be helpful to share in the alpha discussion forums. adding a link to the game could helpful.\\n\\ngood idea! this is now on the list, though it may be after the 2.0 release.\\n\\nthanks, bernd! the translation code is still being worked out so what you see there is placeholders. thank you very much for offering help with translation-- translators will be contacted soon by the translation code. changes are still being made in the blocks, and won\\'t stablize until the beta version in early january.\\n\\nthis version does depend on flash so will work on older android but not iphone/ipad or any android that doesn\\'t have flash support. work is starting on a future html5 /tablet version that will work on ipads etc.\\n\\ntooltips are on the desired features list, but may not appear until after the official 2.0 release (apparently they will take some time to implement).\\n\\nthe translation code is not quite ready so the translations up there are just placeholders. the translation team will be ready soon to contact translators --thanks for offering! a downloadable version of 2.0 is definitely in the works.\\n\\nthere were some bugs introduced that were causing issues you described last week. the alpha is still being revised each day. for the latest version, hold shift + click the reload button on your browser. thanks for reporting!\\n\\nthanks andy. do you have a webcam and is it working with 2.0? here\\'s a gallery with example webcam projects: http://alpha.scratch.mit.edu/galleries/180443/\\n\\nthanks for noting these. much of this is code in process.\\n\\nautosave should overwrite the previous shared stuff. if you want to make a new version that doesn\\'t overwrite your previously shared version, go to the more menu and choose \"make a copy.\" we\\'ll be reviewing the autosave messages based on all the comments here. thanks!\\n\\nthanks, andy, for your feedback. we\\'ll be reviewing the autosave and feedback for knowing things are saved based on everyone\\'s comments. we want to make sure that people realize it\\'s autosaving so some scratch design team members advise against adding a save button. but we\\'ll revisit and figure out ways to handle the feedback so people understand what state it\\'s in. note: that was a bug with create going to full screen mode. if it\\'s still happening, hold shift and click refresh on your browser to make sure you\\'re using the latest.\\n\\na general comment to say thank you all for your ongoing feedback and testing! changes are continuing to be made in the alpha version blocks and wording. translation has not yet started-- the languages you see there are just temporary placeholders for working out the code. we will be reviewing all the feedback on save and autosave. autosave is the way applications are moving online, so we want to figure out how to do it in a way that makes it as clear as possible. for saving to a local folder, for now you can go to the more menu and click \"export to local file.\" that wording will be changing very soon to \"download this file.\" you can also open projects (including 1.4 projects) from themore...menu\"open from local file.\" there will be a downloadable version of 2.0. in that version, file opening and saving to a local disk will be much more prominent, like in 1.4. the reason it\\'s not in the online version as we want to avoid a confusion between where you open and save online projects from where you open and save projects on your local drive. we\\'ll continue to review features, based on the comments here, the scratch 2.0 feedback forums,and as we try out the latest versions. thanks everyone!\\n\\n\"save picture of stage\" is also on the wishlist. again probably after the 2.0 release, as we\\'re trying to get to a release version asap.\\n\\nhi natalie, thanks for answering all our queries!! i can understand your plans to put off implementing much of the stuff to the next version, but i\\'m willing to grovel as much as needed to get the \"make a block\" hidden :-)). the byob design seems reasonable - hidden by default with right-click / edit to display and edit - and hopefully shouldn\\'t be hard to implement. i shared the relevant projects: http://alpha.scratch.mit.edu/projects/10006178 is the converted byob project. http://alpha.scratch.mit.edu/projects/10006177 is the parity magic program that doesn\\'t work (random, position computation)except on full screen. this is the only one of my 1.4 projects that seems to have serious bugs in 2.0. http://alpha.scratch.mit.edu/projects/10006011 is the arithmetic game where the position of the \"say / think\" clouds makes it difficult to play as designed. moti\\n\\nthese links and comments are helpful, thanks. i\\'ll ask others to help investigate the issues with the projects.\\n\\none update about saving i learned today: when the save message says \"save needed\", clicking on the message will make it immediately save. as i mentioned, we\\'ll be reviewing and probably revising the save messages. but for now that may be helpful.\\n\\njust adding that comments should be coming soon.\\n\\nfor the parity magic trick, please see this thread: http://alpha.scratch.mit.edu/forums/topic/327/?page=1\\n\\ni would like to get in on the alpha if possible... thank you! mr. d benjamin middle school http://bms-bsd25-il.schoolloop.com/cms/page_view?d=x&piid=&vpid=1298470826844&no_controls=t http://www.bendist25.org/ http://scratch.mit.edu/users/mdroste just uploaded some resouces for a middle school anti bullying assignment using scratch - storyboard worksheet, student rubric, and schoolwide posters included...\\n\\nhi michael, information about how to participate in the alpha testing is available here. thanks, k\\n\\ni really really hope that downloadable scratch 2 will come along as soon as possible as trusting internet connections for whole class learning usually comes to tears sooner rather than later :( regards simon\\n\\nyep the webcam worked fine - both the built in one on the laptop and also a separate webcam attached via usb to my desktop.\\n\\nthanks natalie. i like the new save options under the file menu. i think they work really well and the save now option is clear. i also like the save needed which appears as a prompt over near the scratch folder. good work!\\n\\nwe definitely agree about this--making the downloadable version is a high priority. i wanted to let everyone know--based on your suggestions here, a file menu has been added to the scratch 2.0 alpha version.it includes \"save now\" and \"save as a copy\" which save to online versions.it also includes \"import from local drive\" and \"export to local drive\" for saving to a local drive. another feature added is the auto-updating of the x-y in \"go to\" and \"glide to\" blocks in the palette (as you drag and drop a sprite). thanks for these and other suggestions so far!\\n\\nwill there be a beta version?\\n\\nhi natalie, what does \"save as a copy\" mean? is that a different name for \"save as\"? i have encountered a difference between the two:the programming editor i use (jedit) distinguishes between \"save as\" and \"save a copy\" in that with the latter you continue working on the old file and with the former you work on the new file. if it is just a rename, i would consider leaving \"save as\". i don\\'t know which is more intuitive but \"save as\" is nearly universal - even in software like powerpoint that kids are likely to have used - so using a different name might lead to confusion. moti\\n\\nyes, a beta version will be available to all on january 28, 2013. you can read more in a forum post on the main scratch site (and aproject announcing the scratch 2.0 beta).\\n\\n', '8405': 'do you have ideas for the next version of scratch? check out the suggestions athttp://suggest.scratch.mit.edu/-- and post your ideas for discussion either here or there! thanks, k\\n\\ncould there be a edu-gallery where the projects are school appropriate where teachers have accounts and only approved projects posted?? loveeverythingelse!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\\n\\nscratch is pretty amazing, don\\'t give in to user demands to add feature after feature ... pretty soon it would become ... the next eclipse. however, if you do find that there is some pressure to add extra features, consider making them only accessible to people at certain levels. e.g., add a preference setting with different levels, e.g., beginner experienced user power user so that extra features get enabled only when asked for. michael\\n\\nindroduction to the concept of object instances. this is useful both in the educational sense as well as the practical one. for instance, when creating a \"pong\" game with blocks- one would want to create a single \"block\" object, which can receive x and y location parameters. one would then create several identical \"block\" instances, with the same appearance and bahaviour, only different location on the screen. thanks!\\n\\ni\\'d love to see improved connection to the outside world. the scratchboard is a great start - but it would be nice to have connectivity to some of the established microcontroller families; picaxe, arduino, (mbed?).... kids would would benefit hugely from the ability to engage with notonly programming but hardware hacking as well - and all of these hardware families (arduino especially) would be far more accessible if they had a scratch programming interface. i can see that trying to implement all of the many (different) features of these hardware families would be many steps too far - but perhaps the ability to programme simple control sequences and respond to even just digital sensors (analogue would be nice too) would be a start. once someone has been introduced through scratch to one of these processors, and hooked on hardware hacking, they would have the motivation to jump to the native languages for these processors....\\n\\ni\\'ll mention it again here - a real-time collaborative version of scratch. as outlined in agnes chang\\'s paper, a synchronous version of scratch where the stage is shared, but people can work on sprites independently. plus a chat window, etc. probably not for v2, but in my opinion, a holy grail feature for the future. can you imagine, three or four kids from different parts of the world working on a scratch project sychronously? it kind of blows my mind thinking about it. anyway, i know i\\'m going to love scratch 2.0. scratch is is the most fun i\\'ve had with a computer since....iowned an amiga! peter r.\\n\\na few remarks: considering the hebrew version (right to left), and probably the arabic also, their are some problems with some of the blocks. the noun is located after the adjactive. also, found lately - the file import into list options doesn\\'t work in hebrew with any type of file (rtf, txt etc..) creating families of objects with the same properties (instances) is a most for todays programing teaching. no show/hide option for list! also, it would be nice if you can give limited premmison on the web site, for \"friends\" or \"me only\", to view my uploaded .sb great job - keep it up - we love you scratch.... o>\\n\\nfirst of all, i\\'d like to reiterate hadas\\' request concerning object instances. it is annoying to make so many copies of a sprite when you want to have them all behave the same way, just in differentlocations. also, it\\'d be great tohave an easy way to create \"walls\" or \"floors\" - something that all typical sprites cannotpass through. perhaps this could be a stage-only function, where you highlightcertain areas(or select all areas of a certain color on the stage) and click a button, designating it as a no-pass-thru zone. one thing that should not change, however - is the stability. i have never had scratch \\'crash\\'. microsoft\\'s powerpoint (on my mac) is much less stable than scratch. i tried \"alice\" on the mac - crash city! scratch is very well designed. keep it up!\\n\\namiga lol i worked at a computer store about 15 years ago that had some amigas they never moved out... we kept them on display though. man could they run a good \"dragon\\'s lair\"!\\n\\nhere are some points which i think are important: 1. commitment by installation: from the science of persuation, we know that people tend to act in consistency with their past actions and statements. downloading and installing scratch constitutes a clear commitment to use it, and the installed icons present a constant reminder. visiting a website and running scratch there does not create the same commitment, and does not leave the same kind of visible reminders. 2. bad company: i told my 13 year old son, proficient in scratch, that in the future it would run in his web browser. he replied \"you mean like those bad internet games?\". scratch risks to be associated with a lot of simple and low-quality games that are out there. 3. system requirements: i have obtained a collection of old laptops that have become obsolete at my workpace, for use in promotion of scratch. the laptops have more than sufficient performance for scratch in its current version, and even have proper tall screens. (i often tell this one-line joke: \"\\'how wide would you like your screen to be?\\', asked the man with the chainsaw.\") the local school has a good collection of even older computers.if performance requirements increase with the new version then it may not be possible to run scratch on machines that run it today. 4. documentation and translation: all scratch documentation, and translations thereof, must be laboriously upgraded when the user interface changes. this should only be done for good reason, obviously. considering these points, my suggestion would be to make the browser version of scratch more or less exactly the same as the free-standing application, and to continue to provide an installation file. obviously there is a need to also run scratch on offline computers, so i assume that this is being taken care of. a suggestion was made earlier is to make language expansions available through a level setting. this appears to me as a good way to expand scratch while also keeping what we already have, which is very good. torbjorn s\\n\\nalong with the new text formating and layout features, i would love to see some sort of simple math type functionality. as a math teacher, the ability to write mathematical formulas in scratch would greatly increase the the value of scratch in the math classroom. for instance, i have been developing a math game in scratch with my students for them to both learn and practice math concepts: http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/webstermath/1436268 we are limited, however, by our inablity to express concepts like fractions, square roots and exponents in an easily readable manner. a math type could be added to scratch in many possible ways. if scratch 2.0 has some sort of text box feature, then one possible solution would be to include a simple form of latex. i began witing a text box program with latex features already: http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/webstermath/1508149 unfortunately, the project above runs really slowly online and capatalize every letter as it seem the java applet is not case sensitive. furthermore, without recursion, it will be nearly impossible to allow imbedded uses of latex such as a fraction containing numbers with exponents. keep up the great work, scratch team. you are doing an awesome job. -chris\\n\\ni\\'d like a way to restrict what blocks are available, or how many of each can be used. i see a couple of uses for this: 1. as a teacher, i have a certain order that i want to present concepts in. it\\'d be nice if i could hide all the extra stuff, so it\\'s easier to focus on what we\\'re learning. i could un-hide more and more blocks as we progress, until finally we\\'re at the full scratch interface. 2. i often give challenges to my students that have a restriction on how many blocks they can use. do a certain task with only a single green-flag-clicked block. do something else without any while loops. stuff like that. being able to restrict the number of blocks used would make this sort of challenge easier to implement.\\n\\nhi john, this reminds me of the 8-block challenge(http://scratched.media.mit.edu/resources/8-block-scratch-activity-printout) which gives the student the design constraint of only being able to use particular blocks. i thought you might be interested in it if you haven\\'t seen it already. m\\n\\ni hadn\\'t seen that before, but that\\'s exactly the sort of thing i\\'m thinking of. i\\'d just like a way to pass out a starter file instead of a handout, and have scratch enforce the block limitations automatically.\\n\\ni would like to see scratch interface with (php, coldfusion, etc) and be able to populate a mysql database and also query a mysql database through a php query (ability to add javascript and ajax code that communicates with scratch). alternatively, if it had the ability to export scores to an email, php and coldfusion pages could be created to enter records into a database (with some modifications).\\n\\ni like to see turtle sprites... neha\\n\\n', '13749': 'integrating scratch into the curriculum and the arts michelle chung, andrea ange, debbie corleto, frank abbot, karen

art. aa- how to get other teachers on board? karen eutemey- knowing what other teachers are doing is very helpful. frank abbot- there are the physical hurdles: computers for teachers, time for personal development before implementation in class, feeling like they are ready and giving them technical support while they use the tool. dc- computer and art people are most likely to use this first. barbara sanchez- i teach french and computer science, so i created a model of famous monument in paris.have them do a little walking tour they will have to do some linear stepping through backgrounds ke- likes to work with groups of kids and have them work with projects that they are working in conjunction with then the group has the final say would be whichever child might be responsible for each component. bs- advisor for the 21st century literacy class which is funny because there are a million definitions for this out there. whos to say what that literacy should include? but i can see using this in class. fa- in the lab they have online lessons. scratch might be an alternative assignment instead of a powerpoint, they can use scratch to be the presentation formatyou can verify that with the cs teacher, there must be at least one computer for every two kids. ke we have a lab and carts with laptops you can sign up to be in the lab, or you can sign out a laptop. dc _ nothing worked last year but now getting them on it and i do want to collaborate just because im new to it im going to have to go through the curriculum to get people into it. fa i have mixed feelings about the projects, but they will get caught up in the minutia of the programming part. ke theyre computer teacher starts working with them in fourth grade in scratch. dc do i do it with all of them so they are all working on it all three years? bs- you mean you get them for all three years? thats great! michelle chung- what if you did a combo pack? what if you took the tour of the museum, and what if you expanded that into creating a tour of different areas in small groups?if they are working in groups or pairs different pieces can be dropped into a combined program. aa- because there is the import function mc- you can do what lorraine is doing which is very macro with her world museum. bs- i introduce it by giving my students one card a week for the kids that want to go faster since i have taught high school computer science i could get into other stuff. aa-some of the ideas i am hearing are cartooning, creating video type works, mapping areas, creating games and really first we have to find teachers that are interested and either do a formal workshop or reach out to the project based learners in your schools and work with them bc- bring them in and work in collaboration. ke- the foreign language teachers can use this as an assessment tool... the kids get five points for the getting the response correct and the recording option is also very neat mc- you can actually change the language of scratch. click on the globe and change it to the language you are teaching fa- do you collect data on who is still using it from the workshops? mc- not formal but what we have been seeing is a lot of people continue to use the website and forums for discussion. we break but im sure that more ideas are out there for integrating this into the whole school. please

elective at norris middle school in bakersfield, ca using scratch for one quarter (10 weeks)for the past few years. the students range from 5-8th grade.\\n\\n', '12443': \"hi guys, i really could do with some help and ideas here. i have an interview for teaching post in a school. during the interivew i have to teach a class of 12-13 year olds a lesson on scratch, the emphasis being on 'word language'. it can be assumed that the class have no pior knowledge on scratch or programming for that matter. anybody have any suggestions how i can go about this and also can someone tell me what it means by emphaising the lesson 'word language'? much appreciated. thank you zpatel\\n\\n\", '8820': 'hi! the post and instructions below has been deprecated in favour of a much simpler setup. the new setup uses windows 7 and the ms kinect sdk and my free program kinect2scratch available on http//scratch.saorog.com i\\'d love for you to try it out and give me some feedback! regards, stephen hi everyone, thought some of you might be interested in my page on how to use your kinect with scratch: http://stephen-howell.tumblr.com the kinect is a great add-on for the xbox 360. many people had their doubts, and although core gamers will decry the kinect, it can be really good fun to play around with. literally, you are the controller. there has been some interest in hacking the kinect to work with computers other than the xbox, and there are drivers available now to use with windows, macosx and linux. i became interested in coding processing to work with the kinect, but soon became disheartened when it appeared that bone data (or joint positions) were not readily available, instead only 3d depth data (cool but not enough) was readable. then i found the openni drivers (see links below) and the osc server from sensebloom. they were able to send joint data encoded as osc commands to processing, and i wrote up my own little processing receiver to test it. it worked so well, i delved into their c++ code to see if i could send the same data to scratch. when i couldnt see a way for scratch to interpret the osc code, i read about the remote sensing over the network that scratch allows. this was perfect; i could send scratch commands from a c program which was reading joint data from the kinect. so after making a few scratch proof-of-concept games to test it, i decided to release it all for you guys to test out. you will need: a standalone kinect (one bought without a console) or a kinect that came in a console bundle and the separately available usb plug to connect it to your pc a windows pc (other versions can be made by coders familiar with coding on osx or linux) the openni.org drivers installed the openni2scratch program scratch some kinect aware scratch programs. here are a few: skeleton, ball bounce and space invaders (links to all of these are available on the tumblr page mentioned above) once youve set that up, you have to connect the kinect to your pc and wait for the drivers to install. then run the openni2scratch program. run scratch, execute the scratch program you want to control. calibrate the kinect - this involves standing a fair bit back from it and standing in a calibration pose for a few seconds - see picture on site. once the program has detected you, it will send the joint positions to scratch. after that, see the variables on the sample scratch programs to see how to use the joint data. enjoy. stephen howell\\n\\nthis is fantastic -- thanks so much for sharing!\\n\\nwhaoo, this is really nice. must buy kinect....:) thanks stephen, really really nice work.\\n\\nthere\\'s also a thread about this in the \"advanced topics\" scratch forum.\\n\\ni loved the part of the video showing the scratch cat with the jointed body. thanks for extending the world of scratch!\\n\\nthank you prof. resnick, it means a lot to read that.\\n\\nnew version of the scratch/kinect program available, get it at http://stephen-howell.tumblr.com new features include: gui with some buttons to make usage easier, mirror mode (reflection on x-axis), z-axis information (how far or close are you to the sensor) and rudimentary and untested multiuser mode. i would have tested the multiuser mode more, but my 2 year old refused to stand still for the calibration. i would love to hear if any educators anywhere use this, i will be using it tomorrow in dublin with 18 high school students, i hope to get good feedback from them. regards, stephen\\n\\nthanks anders, if you get a kinect, please let me know what you do with it!\\n\\nthanks karen!\\n\\nhi again stephen i just ordered a kinect (not yet arrived...). but after trying out i sure want to let kids in school (or after?) try and experiment. so in a couple of weeks i hope to have some result. i will try to set up (once a week) an afterschool activity for kids interested in tech and scratch. i think they will love the kinect-scratch connection... :) i will follow your attempts to fix the multiuser interface...\\n\\nwhat a great idea! we\\'d love to hear (or see!) how it works out. please keep us posted on what happens...\\n\\ngot a kinect tuesday after seeing kinect hacks on gizmodo and wired. made a quick proof of concept app, ilean left the cat walks left, ilean right the cat walks right. so, this morning isaw your thread. this is like a whole box of awesome. ilove this community. thank you for sharing. iteach a middle school student technology leadership class. \"your body as keyboard and mouse\", a ui project, lights my kids up. i\\'m trying to come up with a game concept, using kinect for whole body interaction, that teaches addition and subtraction of positive and negative integers. what ikeep running into is that treating the idea of positive and negative quantities ( debit and credit transactions in a bank account) is too abstracted. movement, right/positive and left/negative, seems to be easier to grasp because it is spatial. scratch2kinect lends itself to this task. ithought iwas going to have to work with faast.\\n\\ni\\'m delighted to read that mark, where is your school? i\\'d love to see your finished projects. we are working on teaching science using scratch and the kinect at the moment. regards, stephen ps. my new sig: \"like a whole box of awesome\" - mark erickson\\n\\nhello, stephen, we,

i would like to get going in the next week.\\n\\ngreat stuff! i can\\'t wait for this to get up and running.\\n\\nhi all! we are thrilled to see the excitement around scratch teacher accounts! at this time, we have reached our maximum number of participants for the alpha test, so we wont be adding any new testers. keep your eye on this thread for the release of teacher accounts later in 2016!\\n\\ni am so excited for this to finally be a reality. have been waiting 2 years and emailing a couple times a year to check on progress. i submitted to be an alpha tester the other day so hopefully it made the cut. looking forward to having the students use scratch as a tool in an official capacity with managed accounts (so hard to keep track of without this feature). thank you for all of your hard work so far, and for keeping everyone posted! hope to be part of a fantastic group of teacher alpha testers :)\\n\\nthis is excellent. thank you for your hard work and continued improvements in scratch. as the tech teacher in a 3 year old through grade 8 school this is a great addition. i currently have been coding with scratch from grades 1 through 8 since the hour of code in december. my ability to add students to my \"classroom\" will help me keep track of their projects as well as help the students register their accounts. thank you so much. good stuff!\\n\\nwow. so exciting - this feature would really help take my teaching to the next level. especially helpful with younger students that don\\'t have an email account. i spend too much time dealing with login issues. i\\'d be interested in being a tester.\\n\\ni love being able to see all my classes in one place. assessing their work is my biggest time hog so this would be helpful time wise and i think kids would get better feedback.\\n\\nthis is great great news! thanks all scratch team for building that. looking forward to test it!\\n\\ni absolutely love scratch. is there an update on the status of the alpha test? i am very interested in having my students use scratch under a teacher account. i\\'ve been using scratch in the classroom for the past year.\\n\\nsome of you may find this useful, i have been working with teachers using itch. it does have teacher account along with videos lessons and the ability for teachers to create their own courses. however, it is not free. (full disclosure, my company has been working with itch and code.org to support teachers teaching coding in classrooms).\\n\\nthanks for all... i have two suggestions... it would be fine if teacher could see all the students\\' projects even the unshared projects. as i use scratch in robotics projects, it would be fine if teacher could see also students projects and all the scripts with special extensions... alain\\n\\ni would love to be able to track my students. how can i get my name on the list to be one of the teacher able to use these features.\\n\\nhi, has alpha testing already started? either way, is it possible to still participate? do you know when this feature will be released.\\n\\nhi there! yes, alpha testing has already begun. at this time, we have reached our maximum number of participants for the alpha test, so we wont be adding any new testers. keep your eye on this thread for the release of teacher accounts later in 2016!

i just wonder if there is any function for me to give students comments on their projects?\\n\\nhi there! we are hoping to release a public beta version of teacher accounts later this summer. keep an eye on this thread for more news on release times :)\\n\\nhi there! we are still in the process of alpha testing teacher accounts. at this time, we have reached our maximum number of participants for the alpha test, so we wont be adding any new testers. we are hoping to release a public beta test later this summer. keep your eye on this thread for more news about release times. thanks!\\n\\nhi there! i\\'m not sure i fully understand your question. do you mean to ask if you will have the ability to comment on a student project? if so, then yes! teacher accounts will behave similarly to regular scratch accounts in this way, and you will be able to comment on students work.\\n\\ni am so excited about this! i\\'m going to add my voice to the other educators who asked this question: any updates on teacher accounts?\\n\\nhi kate! we are still in the process of alpha testing teacher accounts at the moment. we are actively working on getting them ready to be shared publically.keep an eye on this thread for more news on release times later this summer. :)\\n\\nso happy to hear this is coming out this summer! keep up the amazing work, guys!\\n\\nthat\\'s good news. i assume that releaseday is some day at the scratchconference in august? keep up the amazingly good work!!\\n\\nwill this definitelybe ready to use in the fall? i need to know now if i should purchase a different paid program. if yours is ready to go in september and free i will be using yours!\\n\\nthis is very exciting news. we plan to use scratch next school year and teacher (parent) accounts and student (child) accounts will make it much easier to manage the process. thank you!\\n\\ngreat news :)\\n\\nin this student-teacher environment, will it be possible for the student to just share their work with just the teacher or, optionally, just with the class and not with the entire scratch community? those of us who work with younger students have to go through a lot of paperwork with parents to allow them to create accounts that can be shared with the wider community. if the student doesn\\'t share with the whole community, i cannot see the project unless i log in as him/her. with 200 students a term (middle school), that is a lot of tedious logging in work. it would be so much easier if we could limit the people they can share their work with. thank you so much for this enhancement, it will make things a lot easier and allow us to continue keeping our kids insulated on the web. paula\\n\\nthanks mitch!! really looking forward to this!\\n\\nthanks, scratch team! this will be awesome! one additional suggestion would be to allow for multiple teachers / instructors for a given course. this would be helpful for courses that are co-taught by both a mainstream and special education teacher or teacher of english learners. looking forward to the release! let me know if you need any additional alpha/beta testers!\\n\\nthis is excellent, what i have to do to be a tester?\\n\\nwhere is the date on the post that says the alpha will be tested \"later this month\"? what month? and please let us know if there is some type of formal process to apply to be part of the testing. i, for one, would like to participate if possible. please be sensitive to educator needs and give us as much information about timing as possible. i can\\'t afford to wait around before buidling my curriculum blocks for this year and if it sounds like this is not going to be available by the time school begins the first week of september, i wish we would be informed of that. i have turn in my topics list soon and do not want to include something that is not going to work out. adding or substituting units during the year is something i try to avoid.\\n\\nnot sure how that happened but i double posted.\\n\\ni am planning a super expansion of scratch creative computing for my 650 student elementary school. this is the tool i really need to set up and monitor accounts and students/work. thanks for all your efforts and please hurry. school is just a month away!\\n\\nteacher accounts are available. i submitted my request for a teacher account and was approved withing 24 hours. pretty exciting. thank you scratch team!

anyway, if anyone has advice and feedback, i\\'d appreciate it. mark\\n\\nhi mark, thank you so much for sharing this information. i\\'m looking forward to buy a raspberry pi this year; first time hearing about the magpi magazine so i started to download the two (2) availableissues. ithink your focus it\\'s unique and it\\'s fair to have variety. awesome examples with comments included andof course the \"hello world!\" was necessary! hope to see more coming. carlos.\\n\\nhi carlos, thanks so much for your comment. the scratch article has been changed quite a bit (we\\'re looking to release issue 3 at the weekend). i am \"racypy\" on the scratch forum, if you want to see what i am up to! mark\\n\\nhi mark, itoo am excited by the rpi but as yet just have it running in a virtual machine. for me the hardware add-ons will be key and would hope that things like lego wedo will be supported on the scratch port for rpi. iliked your examples very much however am worried that you want to focus on traditional programming skills using scratch. idon\\'t believe scratch is the correct tool for that. for me the whole point of scratch is the lack of a command line and focus on multimedia to ease and engage the learning process for children. i thinka scratch \"hello world!\" program should be spinning and whirling coloured lettersshooting around the screen accompanied by a fanfare of trumpets! good luck with the article, mark\\n\\ni just joined scratched. i\\'d been looking at it for awhile, but wanting to reply to mark t\\'s post was what finally spurred me to join. i was going to write exactly what mark w said. the jist of the your magpi article is kind of \"how do you do traditional cs in scratch\". now there is a place for that (i\\'ll tell you about some ideas i\\'ve had in a minute) but for only the second scrach article in the magpi, i feel that it might be a bit on the dry side. jaseman\\'s dizzy cat / crazy drums in issue 1 is much more in keeping with the ... scratch ethos (for lack of a better word). i\\'ve been giving some scratch lessons in my daughter\\'s year 4 class. the lessons were as follows: 1. intro to scratch, sprites, scripts, costumes, the \"say\" and \"change costumes\" blocks. i created a tiny program where the cat says \"i wish i was a dinosaur\", then it changes into a dino courtesy of an imported sprite, then says \"hooray!\" then i got them to do their own thing. 2. stroytelling with scratch. how to use backgrounds, sound, motion, and \"say\" to tell stories. in this case it was a ghost story. the cat is in some dark woods, along comes a ghost with a scary noise, cat screams and runs away (well, \"glides\" away, we haven\\'t done animation yet). the idea of this lesson was that you have 2 or more sprites, and you have to make sure that you put the code that you want the two different sprites to execute in the scripts for those different sprites. this is something that some of the kids in the first lesson were trying to do, but couldn\\'t figure out. again, they were let loose on the computers to do their own thing. i have two more lessons planned, as follows: 3. animation. i\\'m going to show them how to use the repeat loop, custume change, and more instrcutions to make a bat fly across the screen. my daughter has already started playing with this sort of thing at home, for example making people dance while playing cool music. 4. question & answer, making choices. i\\'m going to show them a little program where the cat asks them where they want to go on holiday and how much money they have. if they have enough money then the background will change according to the holiday destination selected. only here do they meet variables, user input, if\\'/then/else, and operators (<). this is the sort of thing that i think makes a better intro to scratch than how to do traditional cs things in scratch. where the traditional cs things are really useful is in cross curricular activities, combining science and maths. for example, the year 6s learn about some basic stats: mean, mode, median. showing them how to implement this in scratch is a good way to help them understand the stats themselves and how computers handle data. it\\'s also cool to have real data that you yourself have harvested, for example using the picoboard to record niose levels in your classroom. at least, i think... this is definitely an untested lesson plan!\\n\\nthanks myra, for your detailed replies. it certainly sounds like you have some great ideas for teaching with scratch. just to give a bit of context for my \"article\" (by the way, the latest draft is a bit different, but still probably rather dry. it does have a game on it now!), i am a teacher in a uk high-school. most of the kids i teach (and i am an english teacher, not an ict specialist!) already have some experience of scratch and what they\\'ve done is mainly the making of stories, animations and games. my agenda was always to use scratch to explore basic programming ideas that might be useful to the students when they begin to learn python (or whatever). the magpi is written by volunteers, so the content depends pretty much on the interests of the contributor. i agree that there are lots of things that one can do with scratch that are more \"scratchy\" than my scripts (and more fun). i am stil a beginner at using scratch. i\\'m sure the editorial team would be happy to publish material with a focus like the one you have taken, if you (or anyone else!) approached them. the idea about environmental data / input sounds amazing, by the way. i\\'ve certainly taken your comments on board. thanks mark :)\\n\\nthanks mark, for your comment. i don\\'t know anything about lego wedo, but the idea of connecting the pi to external devices is certainly key. so far i\\'ve experimented a bit with the gpio pins using leds and a switch, but that\\'s all. i\\'m interested to read your comments on the article. as i said in reply to myra (who made similar points), i do accept the criticism. i know the team at the magpi is keen to keep running articles on scratch and this month i \"stepped up\" to offer some material. i\\'m not sure if the editors will want me to continue. if they do, i\\'ll certainly try to make my next article more fun. it\\'s only fair for me to admit that one reason for the approach i took is my lack of experience as a scratcher! thanks very much for your reply. i appreciate the time you\\'ve taken and the constructive criticism! :) mark by the way, since you are running a virtual pi, i am interested in which release you are using.\\n\\nhi mark, i think your article goes well with alex\\'s later article in issue 3. you\\'ve bravely given your email address in the article but iwondered if your racypy scratchid might be better as the projects could also be downloaded? my intention was not to criticize but more as a warning. i develop software but have recently started a computer club at my son\\'s primary school. they are very quick to see the possibilities when you show them scratch can play sounds and the sprites move and animate. having got that attention then adding in logic and loops to futher control things is much easier than the opposite direction which is; here is a loop, here is some logic etc.. your article has given me some ideas. i think the dice simulator is crying out for 6 costumes representing each side of a die and that wonderful sound as dice bounce across a table top.that\\'swhy ididn\\'t want to be negative as that is whatthe article should be doing. as for my virtual pi it was a virtual box ovi file from february so probably a bit dated. kind regards, mark\\n\\nhi mark, yes i was thinking about adding my scratch id - i just forgot to do that. i\\'ll see if i can get that included before we publish. i don\\'t think ihave uploaded all the scripts i mentioned in the article yet. i will do that. i\\'ll have a go at what you suggest for the dice program. hope you are enjoying the rpi. it might be worth downloading the latest arch release, if you have a chance. it runs faster than the debian versions ;)\\n\\nthis makes quite a nice die roll. just need 6 costumes that look like each face. just needs some sound and perhaps a bit more bouncing! note: scratch can get addictive! i\\'ve created a project called dice roll that uses the above effects then plots the probablity distribution of the rolls. find it under my scratch user id drmcw if interested.\\n\\nmark w, i love your die roll! your project plotting the distribution of numbers you get from the die is exactly the sort of cross-curricular thing i was talking about... nice link with maths there! here\\'s a scratch science project i\\'ve done for myself that would be really cool to do with some kids sometime... i grabbed a thermistor from the shed (doesn\\'t everyone have a collection of electronics in their shed? -- my hubby does electronics for a living and occasionally as a hobby), froze it into an ice cube, attached it to one of the analog inputs of a picoboard, then plotted the restistance (which corresponds roughly to the temperature). this is the resulting graph: the horizontal blue line is about 0c; the ticks along that line are the hours. i love this graph. it shows clear as can be that the temperature remains pretty much constant while the ice is melting, and only then once it\\'s all melted does the termperature climb again, asympotically approaching room temp. yes, you can do real science with scratch!\\n\\nha, too much indentation in my post below, you can\\'t see my lovely melting ice graph! here it is, unindented...\\n\\nexcellent! i\\'ll have a look at your scratch page! yes, i do find scratch strangely addictive ...\\n\\nthis is a really great idea. i wonder if i could do something similar using the gpio pins on the raspberry pi! mark\\n\\nagreed. saw the post about the xbox kinect and scratch which pointed me to the remote sensing protocol in scratch. i\\'m sure that could be use ti access the gpio pins with a small helper program. might have to buy a rpi sooner rather than later. would also want to add a webcam with microphone. have you tried any out to record pictures and sound in scratch by any chance?\\n\\nhi folks, we have too much indentation below, so i\\'ve clicked the post reply button rather than replying to a specific post. mark t wrote \"i wonder if i could do something similar using the gpio pins on the raspberry pi!\" the answer is, yes you can. you would need an analog to digital converter. i have been working on the gertboard, and conveniently, it has exactly such a device. i could easily solder up something that would allow me to connect a thermistor to the a/d inputs of the the gertboard. so then i could collect the data using a c program. and then the question is how to plot it... it has been a long time since i did anything graphical in c, does anyone by any chance have any suggestions for a good library to use to allow me to plot a graph similar to the one i made in scratch? i know how to do graphics in python (well... i\\'m learning python, and i know where to look to find out how to do graphics in python), and i have a python gpio module, so i could do it in python... except that the python gpio module code doesn\\'t drive the spi bus, and the a/d chip uses the spi bus... so i\\'d have to figure out how to do spi in python. so i have to hand almost all the tools i need to duplicate this experiment on the pi! ah, i\\'ve just thought of a way i could do it: i could collect the data using a c program, then put it into a file, then in scratch i could read the data from the file into a list, then i could plot the data in the same way i plotted the data collected by the picoboard! then i could do the whole thing on the raspberry pi. it would be more elegant to either (re)learn how to plot things in c, or how to drive the spi bus in python...\\n\\nsounds great. really like the thermistor stuff. does the picoboard work with the raspbery pi? p.s. mark\\'s card shuffling demo and your mention of recording sound gave me the inspiration to write a snapcard game using the microphone in scratch. uploaded the project earlier today if interested! (unlikely to be useful in a noisy classroom though)\\n\\nembarassingly, i haven\\'t yet tried the picoboard with the rpi. .... ok, i just did! it works beautifully. just plugged it in, and it works. this is using the new debian wheezy os. i haven\\'t been able to make wedo work with the rpi yet, but i do have some ideas i can pursue. i think that it\\'s quite likely that i can make it work, with the help of my husband who is a systems and hardware expert.\\n\\njust seen your article in issue 3 of magpi. well done!\\n\\nthanks, the good news is that the editorial team (i\\'m sort of on the fringe of it!) want me to do more on scratch. i\\'ll try to do something more fun next time.\\n\\nwow - i am so impressed that you are using your pi and scratch like this! i am not much of a hardware person ... it\\'d be great to see more about these projects. do you have a blog, myra - or maybe you could do an article for the magpi? mark\\n\\nhi mark, i hope you do get an rpi soon - sounds like you have some great ideas for it. i don\\'t know if anyone has done anything with recording audio on the pi as yet - there\\'s no analogue audio input (just a headphone jack). i don\\'t know what happens if you plug in usb microphone / headset. these sorts of projects will certainly get the young people interested. :)\\n\\nhey mark, bought my raspberry pi 2 days ago; just waiting to play with it!\\n\\nwe\\'ve slightly modified scratch to allow it to use addon boards with the raspberry pi (through the spi bus). using the piface board (http://piface.openlx.org.uk), we\\'ve also got interfaces for scratch, python and c http://pi.cs.man.ac.uk/interface.htm. our idea is that people can mix and match and move between the languages as they learn more. we\\'ve got some local activities working with teachers developing worksheets, but when i saw this i wondered if people would be interested in some sort of online colaboration?\\n\\nyes, this sounds like something i would be interested in. i\\'ve done a fair bit of work on the gertboard so i\\'m familiar with the idea of using the gpio to do things in the real world.\\n\\nthere\\'s a demo of it on youtube http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohawduauaje including our emulator -- i\\'m looking at porting it to other boards like gertboard.\\n\\nyes, that would be a great idea. i am quite ignorant about scratch and external devices (and i\\'m very much a beginner at scratch anyway). please feel free to email me at: antiloquax@sky.com thanks, mark\\n\\nbreaking news! as of last night, i have got lego wedo working with the raspberry pi, with the help of alex bradbury. this is with the debian wheezy sd card image. at the moment, wheezy is still in the testing phase with the raspberry pi, but feedback on it is so positive that after this weekend it\\'s going to be the recommended distro. alex (who\\'s organizing the release of wheezy on the rpi) will incorporate the changes that allow wedo to work into the scratch that\\'s included with the wheezy sd card image, so wedo will work straight out of the box! hooray!\\n\\nexcellent news. things seem to be progressing at quite a pace. feel rather out of the loop so maybe should order one..... have bitten the bullet and am in the queue, so no idea when i\\'ll actually get it. just wondering what they intend to do for schools as at the moment you can only order one per person?\\n\\ni just thought i\\'d give you a preview of what i am working on for next month\\'s scratch patch. like i have said, i am a beginner. this is actually the first scratch project i\\'ve made that uses animation and sound. i would appreciate some feedback. on issue is that we are quite short of space in the magazine (i only get 2 pages) so i will have to keep the project quite small. anyway ... it\\'s a (simple!) version of frogger: edit - i\\'ve added some project notes. thanks! mark\\n\\nirun a computer club at my son\\'s primary school and the lego wedo proved a hit. using external hardware would certanly be of interest. i need to order an rpi for myself and see if ican get the school interested in using it too. any collaboration could well be of interest.\\n\\nthis is excellent news myra. i\\'ve mentioned the great stuff that the scratch community are doing to the magpi team. they are very impressed. i\\'ve posted a link to something i am working on for next month\\'s magazine, i\\'ll repost it here. if i can get my act together to do something that shows scratch interacting with the outside world, i will definitely write about it in the magazine. frogger clone.\\n\\ni just had a lesson with some y8 students in which i showed them my frogger game and told them about the rpi foundation\\'s competition. then i let them choose to improve my game or make their own. i was impressed with what they did. i\\'m an english teacher so i don\\'t often get the chance to do this. they had done some scratching before, but i\\'m not sure how much. anyway , most of them seemed to get the idea pretty quickly (quicker that i did!) :)\\n\\njust had a go with your frogger. it\\'s good! the sound effects are excellent. just a few suggestions: arrow keys are easier to use than letter keys (maybe use left arrow for left, right arrow for right). the frog sometimes ends up under the log rather than on top of it. under looks there is a \"go to front\" block which would probably sort the program. maybe a better picture of a frog? but then i\\'m so not an artist that i feel i really have no right to complain about this!! anyway, it\\'s nice. it\\'s basic, but this is a good thing: it sets them thinking \"hey, it would be better if...\" and then they start to look into how they can make it better.\\n\\nthanks myra, i\\'ll change the keys. i\\'ll have a lookfor that \"go to front\" block, i haven\\'t used it before. i have had a go a re-drawing the frog. i\\'m not much good at art ... i do need to keep it simple as anything that looks much nicer would take up quite a bit more room in the magazine. although i have realised how to use a background instead of sprites for the \"water\" and \"river-bank\"!! mark\\n\\ninstead of drawing a frog, why not use the 2 scratch cat sprites? changing the costume makes it look like he\\'s waliking. you can call it scratcher instead of frogger! well ordered the raspberry pi and now have to wait 11 weeks! so should get it for halloween!\\n\\njust downloaded to look at the scripts and yes you need to use the stage background and just have sprites for the logs and frog.\\n\\nhi mark, yes, i realised that i should use a background. i had not got around to updating my scratch file. like isaid, i\\'m a beginner ...\\n\\nissue 4of magpi out now. well done with the frogger game.\\n\\ninow have a raspberrypi! one thing that hasn\\'t been mentioned here but is a topic on the raspberrypi forum is the performance of scratch on the raspberrypi or rather lack of. as it stands, its not a combination icould recommend. what are others thoughts?\\n\\nhi mark, sorry i haven\\'t been on here and answered your posts. glad to hear you have a pi. as i guess you have seen if you go on the rpi forums, there is some discussion going on about the performance of scratch. as far as i know, nothing major has been done yet. i did try to recompile squeak from source, but i ran into a heap of problems and gave up. i will probably have another go at some point. but really it needs the scratch developers to sort something out ...\\n\\nthat\\'s ok. not sure scratch is the problem ithink the vm needs some work and jiting it would be just what\\'s needed. started looking at it myself but its not within my skillset...at the moment!\\n\\nthanks mark, sorry ihaven\\'t replied until now. the october issue will feature a little bubble sort program. i have also been having fun with scratch with my gcse computing group - we\\'ve done a program to convert denary to binary, and one that does hex.\\n\\nlook forward to that. have checked out the convertors and you need to add a test for negativenumbers and fractions!\\n\\nhi mark, thanks for you feedback on the binary and hex converters. i don\\'t think iknow how to do that yet! i need to brush up on my understanding of two\\'s complement and floating point numbers in binary! mark\\n\\nwas thinking more of defensive programming so detecting a negative number or fraction and asking user to re-enter a positive integer.\\n\\nhi mark - yes, i see what you mean. that would be sensible. however, i want to tackle the more complex side of binary representation at some point. iam teaching gcse computing and i have been using scratch to ease my y11 students into programming. most of them had used it a bit to make animations etc, but not really to create more \"traditional\" programs. thanks for your comment!\\n\\ni\\'m about to ask for raspberry pi & arduino kits as a donorschoose project. anyone know if this particular kit(with \"raspbian\")will be \"wedo-ready\" out of the box? i\\'ll be back!\\n\\nlooks a nice kit. raspberry pi only runs scratch 1.4 which does support wedo out of the box although i have only ever used it on a windows machine and not the raspberry pi. so i\\'d expect it to work but am not 100% certain as haven\\'t tried that.\\n\\nso, i finally got the r-pi and have confirmed that the raspbian distribution works with the lego wedo system just fine. yay! however, not so much luck with the laptops i tried. boo. (i installed the ubermix [ubuntu] distro on 2 old-ish dell latitude d610\\'s, and the wedo usbconnection does not seem to be working/recognized on either laptop. the special blocks do not appear in scratch, nor does any sensor or motor work, even if i make the blocks appear by using themenu, then put them in a program. and yes, i tried all of the usb ports.) i\\'d welcome any clues for trouble-shooting this -- or connections to folks who might know something abuut how/why the raspbian distro does work with scratch+wedo. i\\'ll also post separately...\\n\\n', '32624': 'i have an email in to scratch about this issue, but they indicated that it may take a while to respond. my students have been working on creating games and other presentations to enter into a computer fair for about 2 months now. yesterday one of my students logged into his account and his project was gone. instead he saw a list of 17 \"projects\" that i inferred to be related to the times that he was learning the program and following tutorials. is there any way to retrieve his project? i am at a loss and the computer fair occurs in a few weeks. thanks\\n\\n', '1582': 'as part of one of my math classes we are learning about scratch. i was asked to write a scratch procedure that would allow me to produe a regular polygons that have a fixed perimeter of \"420 sprite steps.\" i was wondering if anyone can help me get started on this. thank you in advance for any help you can give!\\n\\nif you know the perimeter (420) and the number of sides (taken as input), then you can calculate the length of each side and the interior angle (http://www.coolmath.com/lesson-interior-angles-of-polygons-1.htm), which is all you need to draw the polygon. does that help?\\n\\na little.i guess i just don\\'t understand how you can set your perimeter where it has to be 420 and will not change on scratch. if that makes any sense!\\n\\nin my program, i used variables. i created a variable called perimeter and set it to 420. i then used an ask block to get the number of sides from the user, so that the answer block stores the number of sides. using that andperimeter, i can figure out the length of each side. (e.g. if the perimeter is 420, a triangle will have sides of length 420/3=140 and a square will have sides of length 420/4=105). using the number of sides (in the answerblock), i can determine the interior angle (the link from my earlier post). next, i draw the polygon using pen down, repeat, turn, and moveblocks. does that make more sense?\\n\\nif you don\\'t mind a spoiler, i can post my project. but i\\'m also happy to help debug. :)\\n\\nthanks for all the help! after tons of hours of thinking of it i finally got it. i think i was just over thinking it!! i did it pretty much the same way!!! thanks again!\\n\\nthat\\'s awesome! i\\'m happy to hear that you got it worked out! :)\\n\\n', '60189': 'hello teachers! i am looking for a class of students that will collaborate with my class. we are in calgary, canada and would like to do a cultural project with a class of any grade 1 to 12. we are looking for a class that is in a different country than ours, or that are in eastern canada (as this is a valuable difference as well). i have collaborated with classrooms around the world before and found it to be an amazing experience for all involved. this project will be simple. the project for my grade 5 students will have this is our guiding question \\'what makes us canadian?\" and the international class would do the same for thier country. students in the class would create scratch projects about significant historical events, people that have had an impact on their country, key ideas... whtever is in your curriculum. if you are in grade 4 to 12, each student could make a project. younger grades may make a project together as a class. a really exciting part is that we would share a scratch studio. the students would communicate to each other through their projects and through comments. knowing that there is a groups of studetns from another part of the world that they are working with is tremendously exciting for the students. they love to show off their own countries. they also love to make scratch projects! if you understand what i am trying to put together, please comment - send a message - on my scratch account: \\'lgmeloche\\' . hope to work with you soon!!!! replies lilli meloche member march 07, 2019 \\'collaborate\\'\\n\\n', '6560': 'i\\'ve been using scratch for 3 years with my intro and ap comp sci classes. my students and i have noticed really inconsistent collision detection between sprites. for instance, if a program a dragon sprite to bounce off a prince sprite, the dragon doesn\\'t bounce off the prince\\'s edge. sometimes it appears like the dragon bounces off the prince\\'s centerpoint, or sometimes not at all. does anyone know the inner workings of scratch\\'s collision detection? a lot of the time, we\\'ve just switched to detect colors as a way to get around this.\\n\\nthere\\'s a couple basic things to check for, just in case your kids haven\\'t found them: the sprite\\'s center of rotation (in the costume editor) in the center? when the sprite are colliding, how many steps they take in a \"move\" block. if the moves are big, they can pass over the sprite before getting to the command that checks for touching. karen r.\\n\\nhi. i don\\'t know the inner workings of collision detection in scratch. just wish to share how we solved a similar problem. in a project (see link below) i was creating, my sprite oogy refused to stay on the yellow path. my son timothy, taught me a way to get round thproblem. he asked me to design the sprite with special contact points. if you take a look at my sprite oogy in the project \"the adventures of oogy\" at http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/aitan/1297995, i had initially designed it without the hat and shoes. i had many problems because oogy could easily get into the blue parts and refused to stay on the yellow path. so timothy added in the hat and shoes as contact points and that solved the problem. in this project, we used colours for sensing. i believe that if you design your sprites with specific contact points, you will be able to solve your problem. however, if the moves are too many, for example \"move 10 steps\" instead of \"move 1 step\", oogy is once again able to get off the yellow path. this is exactly the case as described by karen above. ai boon\\n\\nthanks for the suggestions. i will try multiple contact points. it came up again today with a student who put a shooting element into her game. when the bullet hits the dragon, nothing happens. only when the bullet the exact center of the dragon does it increment the score. this is a little too sensitive for her game. we tried to change it to sensing the color of the dragon and the results were even worse. i\\'ll see what we can accomplish today. thanks so much.\\n\\n', '4363': 'hi, i am planning a high school teacher course in modelling. but i am unsure whether scratch has sufficient functions for modelling, like star log for instance. are there anyone who have tried doing modelling with scratch?

i know of the webcam - but how can we make it more than just waving across the webcam to make the cat move? any suggested projects or galleries for ideas? i feel as though sound could be used too with scratch 2.0. thank you for all suggestions!\\n\\nthat would be interesting for me as well, since i'm thinking about integrating computing and physical world in math or physics classes. open to hear more.\\n\\ni did some classes with the scratch board. it was great fun. first of all u need the driver. then you should try getting the kids making different games with the sensors on board. voice activated games (the louder you scream the higher the spirte rises - like floppy birds), same can be done with the scratch 2 mic option. then comes the intresting part. the scratchboard has 4 aligator plugins. if you cunnect conductive objects to any of the ports, you can close a circuit. for example, a simon says kind of game: we glued tin foil to a popsickle stick and connected the aligator. a small wooden flank can make the stick jumpy like a keyboard. hope this helped. o>\\n\\n\", '27563': 'starting august 2014 i will be teaching a course, that i\\'ve pretty much been given free reign over. they are students who, as freshman, failed the first semester of algebra i and had to retake it. i\\'m inheriting them as sophomores and in charge of teaching them \"the rest\" of algebra i and all of geometry in one year. the good news is i get them for 2 periods a day. during this past year a student showed me scratch, and actually taught the class 3 days of coding. i\\'m excited and overwhelmed at the potential, i want to make this class successful and fun. not sure where to start.\\n\\n270 views and no advice?

(http://www.csjumpstartr.com/schools) more info: a collaborator and i - both scratch enthusiasts in informal-ed settings - have been working on a scratch-based product we call csjumpstartr. the driving purpose is to make it easier for teachers (and homeschool parents) use scratch for \"show what you know\" projects in existing curriculum units, without themselves needing to teach coding. csjumpstartr is a self-contained build of the open-source scratch 2.0 editor and a collection of templates for content projects (slideshows, quizzes, poster-boards, etc.) with integrated step-by-step guidance delivered in the browser. each template is supported by pdf worksheets, documentation, and \"take it further\" challenges. kids can work through completing a template independently, so the teacher can integrate the project into an existing curriculum without needing to teach coding too. using our templates, kids with no scratch experience can create a finished project; and kids with more experience and/or a penchant for tinkering can expand on the template. we know there are a lot of teachers who would like to integrate creative coding, but they face barriers like lack of curricular flexibility, or lack of expertise, or lack of it support. we think our approach can help, by supporting teachers to use scratch to deliver traditional end-of-unit summary projects. we\\'d love it if our product resulted in scratch getting used in more schools by more teachers. in that vein, we are looking for teachers and schools - ideally in the boston area - who are interested in piloting csjumpstartr with 4th to 6th graders. we\\'d get you set up and advise you on implementation, and in return we\\'d ask for feedback and ideas for improvement. if you\\'re interested, please get in touch with me here on scratched or via our website (http://www.csjumpstartr.com/schools).

thinking, a set of concepts, practices, and perspectives that draw on ideas from the world of computing. in the past few years, there has been a growing recognition of the importance of computational thinking for understanding and solving problems in a wide range of contexts, not only in the field of computer science. as young people program and share scratch projects, they begin to develop as computational thinkers: they learn core computational and mathematical concepts, while also learning important strategies for designing, problem solving, and collaborating. in the third of three webinars focused on computational thinking, we will focus on computational thinking perspectives: expressing, connecting, and questioning. all webinars will be recorded and shared on scratched. join

manually move them back to their starting point every time you start the scripts?\\n\\nyou have to program all of the start-up conditions (initial position, initial size, initial costume, whatever else) with blocks. for example, if i want the cat to start at position (-134, 61) and then glide to position (0,0), i put a \"go to x y\" block at the top of the stack, then put in a \"glide\" block. after the cat arrives at (0,0), i want that sprite to get bigger, so i put in a loop with a \"change size\" and a short \"wait\". but i also add a \"set size\" to reset the cat\\'s size each time. i put a \"when green flag clicked\" on top of the stack to make it easy to trigger. here\\'s a pictureof the script. i hope that answers your question! k\\n\\nthis video tutorial shows one way to set a start state.\\n\\nhere is a tip for finding out what x,y values you want to use for a sprite. i\\'ll explain using an short and simple method. 1) start a new scratch project. click on motion. notice how it defaults with scratch the cat at position 0,0 (in the center of the screen.) 2) drag the cat sprite to any new location on the screen. click on looks. click on motion again. 3) look in the

getting a username and password dialog box when i go to the site to try out scratch 2.0 is this supposed to happen during may 17-21? maybe i missed where the password was given.\\n\\nin addition to the motion sensing settings for the webcam, i wonder if it would be feasible to add in dark/light sensing? arbitrarily, let\\'s say you assign 0 to the darkest colors and 500 to the lightest. then you could create a maze project where your sprite is programmed to behave a certain way when hitting the walls (when color =0, turn right). then hold up a maze to the webcam and see if your sprite can make it through. another option might be to create image filtering art projects, similar in function to instagram or photobooth. use commonds like \"if color > 400, change color to random\". just a thought. :)\\n\\nhi, david. thanks for the suggestion. we\\'ve been experimenting with sensing color from the video using the existing color touching blocks. the idea is that, when the video is turned on, those blocks could sense colors from either things on the stage or from the video. if it works well enough, that would allow users to draw mazes and hold them up to a webcam as you suggest, as well as projects such as those shown in this (old) video created by jay silver and eric rosenbaum, two graduate students in the group:?????????? http://vimeo.com/9512436. it\\'s an interesting idea to sense only brightness. one of the big issues with color involves calibration to different cameras and lighting conditions. a brightness sensor might also require some calibration, but since it\\'s just a single threshold, it\\'s much easier to work with, similar to using the \"loudness\" block. i can imagine that many projects would not need any calibration at all and, if they did, a single slider would be sufficient. -- john\\n\\nhi pratibha, you just caught the site when it closed again. between may 17 at 9am and may 21 at 9pm you didn\\'t need a password. k\\n\\nscratch 2.0 is very nice, really. even if some of the new features are not fully \"newbie-proof\" as i expected, nevertheless being able i) to run scratch from you browser without any need for installation and ii) to directly inspect other members\\' projects is a great improvement. i\\'m sure everything will be perfectly redesigned before the official release. even cloud variables (even if i don\\'t expect to use them a lot) will allow students to have a lot of fun. what is that i like really a lot? custom blocks and clones. and i expect to love a lot the new vector-graphics image editor too (not accessible yet). what i don\\'t like at present? some \"hidden\" behaviours: it is not immediate to understand if and how custom blocks can have arguments; it is not immediate to manage clones; it is not immediate (in version 2.0, it used to by immediate in scratch 1.x) to access sprite\\'s info (name, position, etc). anyway i expect scratch 2.0 to be a great tool for all of us, with all we need

scratch programming concepts- this handout documents some of the core computational concepts in scratch. it\\'s a bit abstract (in that it\\'s not step-by-step), but it might help you think about how you want to help your students get started with scratch. design studio activities - this is a collection of design activities. again, it\\'s not step-by-step, but it might inspire different types of activities to try. beyond the looking - this is a seven-part workshop that a colleague and i conducted over several months with a group of middle-school students. although it\\'s connected to a storytelling/empathy theme, each activity describes the blocks that are introduced, which might be of interest to you. learn scratch - i don\\'t have experience with this set of resources, but i know others have used it and have liked it. it\\'s a series of lesson plans and video tutorials for scratch. there\\'s more available -- both on scratched and soon to be added. i look forward to hearing about what you try! hope that helps, karen\\n\\none more thing...i was reading linda\\'s post about how she gets started with scratchand i realized that i forgot to mention the scratch cards! i think the cards are a really great way to give students freedom to explore different code excerpts that they can then build up into interesting projects.\\n\\nfrom my experience running several scratch classes, kids really want to make computer games right away. so resources such as lists of game mechanics with popular game examples really help them brainstorm. what imostly end up doing is letting kids work on their own ideas most of the time, since that\\'s what they want to do, and then devoting 10-20 minutes out of every hour to showing them a connection of a couple of particular scratch commands to game mechanics. connection examples: sensing - touching color, with motion - go to x, y for the maze game mechanic (teleport to the start of the maze upon touching walls) motion - point toward sprite, with motion - move steps, for chase and resource collection game mechanics (think pac man) looks - change effect, with sounds, for win/lose notification mechanics as students develop projects, they can have an ongoing collection of these, similar to the format istarted, but with examples of their own projects, either on a poster on the wall, or on the web. i taught a scratch class this spring with only six 75-minute meetings, and some students who never programmed before. i did no formal introduction of computer terms, and indeed very little (probably 20 minutes total) discussions overall, other than helping with particular project questions. however, at the end of the class i went through a basic vocabulary list from a computer science 101 class, such as \"conditional statement\" and \"infinite cycle\". students were able to make examples for everysingletermfrom their own projects and those of classmates. it felt like magic.\\n\\nwell, i went through the entire learnscratch.org tutorials and i think they\\'re suitable to learn the language step-by-step, with a very gentle introduction to programming; my feeling is that the first two parts may be simply given directly to students since they are very simple, but if the kids are really young they may appear somehow long; by the way, i strongly appreciate the approach outlined in the first reply, since i think that it is more engaging to give young students free (yet assisted) time to explore the language and - then - cook down the cs concepts behind\\n\\ni agree with roberto. i found the learnscratch.org tutorials to be very useful indeed. i start off with the really basics (movement). i use classroom management software to lock the learners input devices and blank their screens while i demonstrate some theory over the data projector. this is usually preceded by: imagine we were designing our very own game, where our hero had to walk around a house blah, blah, blah. i show them how its done, and emphasize that there could be other ways to do it. i unlock their computers and have them repeat what i showed them. so, i found the look & listen, then do approach to work rather well.they get bored with this if you carry on too long, so be sure to follow with a mini project. my grade 6s are now in the mid-stage of designing their own games in teams of 4. and i am absolutely amazed at some of their projects. no doubt, im the one with the knowhow but, they are the ones with the imagination.\\n\\ni have just posted up our revised redware lesson plan at http://scratch.redware.com/lessonplan.html. the plan is suitable for 7-12 year olds learning scratch over 6-8 sessions. i hope to revise the accompanying videos soon and post onto youtube. please let me know if you like them or give me any ideas for improvements. they are not as comprehensive as the learnscratch tutorials but leave a lot of room for children to investigate by themsleves whilst ensuring that the basics are understood.\\n\\ni\\'m thinking of creating a curriculum for a group of students ages from 13-15 to teach programming concepts using scratch. the number of hours i\\'m looking into is about 100 hours stretched across 3 years. is that too long?\\n\\nthe 100 hours doesn\\'t seem long to me, but i don\\'t have an intuition about the 3 years. when kids are working on

recommended dress for this? are you suit and tie/dress and nylons types? jeans and t-shirts? capris and blouses? i\\'m flying ryanair, so i can bring a very limited amount! don\\'t have room to bring a little of everything, and don\\'t want to bring the wrong stuff, either. from previous scratched event photos, i\\'d go with nice casual, which, considering the weather here this week, would be capris and light blouses, maybe long pants for dinner. does that sound reasonable? please, some nice barcelonan lady who\\'s attending, give us a good idea!\\n\\nthe walk is the informal gathering. for sure when we stopped moving: 9 pm dinner near cathedral. that\\'s early to spanish standards (but we start eaerly the next day. joek\\n\\nheard from joek--informal. i\\'m going for capris (longer than knee-length, but shorter than pants) and blouses, so they\\'re good for meetings and sight-seeing (i\\'ve read most churches require shoulders and knees covered).  thanks for the quick reply. see

suggest? need less to say the tools you use are fantastic. i imagine i'd need to go a cheaper route. as a side note this is also an interesting way to reach the more severely handicapped. thanks,

generous offer that i'd love to take you up on. my issue is i would be using online tools for private paid tutoring, so i am assuming the tools that you use on teachersteachingteachers.org i would not

following wednesday is fine. thanks, vicki gold\\n\\nhi all, i skyped a tutoring session with a very sick high school student. it wasn't scratch it was a java lesson that went very well. a few days prior to the session she sent me the programs. during the session we discussed her problems and ways to solve her problems. we talked about using the debugger. while in discussionn i emailed a few but not all the solutions back to her. i think our discussions were very casual and she was more relaxed then had met in person. i think the same for hold true for scratch, but i think a lot depended on her age. she is just going into 10th grade, so she is quite comfortable with the technology.with scratch you could use the web site to post and repost work in progress. thanks vicki\\n\\nvicki, that's exciting about your work with the 10th grader. do you teach high school? i'd love for my animation students to have regular exchanges with other high schoolers using scratch. i'm working on my

grab the link to the creative computing curriculum guide and spotted your question. the best solution i've found for this is to have students create a master game sprite where they drag all of their scripts, sprite costumes and backdrops into. then this 1 sprite can be exported/imported to combine work of multiple students into 1 game. this doesn't work if each student is creating tons of content in their project, but works really well if parts of the game have been split between several students. to avoid confusion i would have them include their username (if not real name) in the master

since we got a sig (school improvement grant) a few years ago, we replaced textbooks with laptops! we have a wonderful innovative site for math that i\\'ve used for two years now (corefocusonmath.com), but it\\'s just a 21st century tool used to teach centuries old curriculum! these laptops should be used for something better...something, applicable... it was at a conference in may that i heard about scratch. the dream became a plan. and that\\'s where i\\'m at now. my principal is on board. next year, i will attempt to do something different. i will alternate between the common core standardized mathematics that i\\'m forced to teach, and the computer programming skills that my students need (and will probably want) to learn. at least...that is the plan. because here\\'s the immensely scary part: i have never done this before. i took a couple of programming classes in college, but those were awful and burned me out with computer programming without giving me the knowledge and confidence necessary to do it, much less teach it. so, in the next month i\\'m diving in and trying to figure this out. i\\'m excited and scared and hopeful. can i get 180 or so students signed up for this site? will it work? what is the progression of stuff that i teach them when we\\'re starting out? and how do i best go about this? will this just fail miserably, or will it become a model that hopefully many schools like mine and in general could follow?so many questions, and any insight would be greatly appreciated. the journey begins now.thank you so much for reading this and sharing anything that you might feel inclined to share.\\n\\nhello! i\\'m a new member so am just reading this. i wish i had read this last year - could have definitely helped out! anyways - we create comprehensive curriculums to teach scratch to elementary school students from grades 2 -5. we have a structured lesson plan that progresses from teaching the fundamental elements of scratch to writing scripts using operators and variables. we print out books for students to use and refer to during class, and we send home project ideas to try out at home. we have never taught high-school students before - and definitely not with a math theme - but i would be happy to discuss some ideas of how we can possibly get your students interested, engaged and motivated! scratch is a great tool to learn programming and logic fundamentals and the possibilities are endless - this is my second full curriculum that i have developed and i feel that i\\'ve barely \"scratched\" the surface!! :) email me at info@tinytechsclub.com if you would like more information. vrinda\\n\\ntake a look at our scratch courses we\\'ve created at courses.ucodemy.com; let me know if you\\'d like more information and trial access to see if it\\'s a fit for you. we are focused on providing support for teachers like yourself to deliver coding courses in the classroom; we\\'re you\\'re backup team when you need us!\\n\\n', '22168': 'please come along to our free scratch sessions for parents and children and adults-only in brighton (uk) as part of the brighton digital festival on sat 14 september. more information and tickets from http://www.brightondigitalfestival.co.uk/events/scratch\\n\\n', '26468': 'hello scratched team, with my 4th graders today, i had sent them to the ccow \"about me\" studio to view the projects as they are going to make an about me project . like only 4th graders can do, they found the few projects that were not intro projects created by ccow but random projects that were not entirely appropiate for viewing in a school setting. one was a shooter game, and another was a project that shows an ax striking a character in the head.  is there anyway that these projects can be removed from this studio?

i\\'m currently preparing a course where i will try the following: i\\'m preparing a game where all sprites except the hero are already fully programmed. the students must program the hero themselves. every level is clearly associated with one concept, and in order to get through the level, students must program the hero according to this concept. example: a taxi arrives, and the hero must board it. solution: go to taxi in a forever loop. the taxi in turn checks whether the hero indeed comes along when the taxi pulls out. the necessary new concept at this point (forever loop) is learned through a specific handbook chapter which explains it and contains exercises. the idea is that the \"master exercise\" (get through the level) acts as a focus: during the regular exercises, students can play and try this and that, but to get through the level, they really need to understand and apply one particular concept, otherwise it\\'s \"game over\". in order to avoid that students blindly copy their solutions from the regular exercises, there is always a little twist that they discover only when the game goes on. in the taxi case, the taxi stops at some point, the hero must get out and reach a specific entrance area on the stage. for this, they need to rewrite their forever loop into a repeat-until-key-pressed loop (same handbook chapter), sequenced with a goto x y (previous handbook chapter). i have no experience with this setup yet; all i can say already is that the programming effort on my side is rather high (but it\\'s fun...). if it works out well, i will certainly share the resources.\\n\\n', '14545': 'i have a group of kids and we are working on building a candy snatcher detector. we are using a makey makey we built candy detectors and can tell when a kid takes more than one candy. the kids also build two versions of a \"silly string shooter\" which will shoot the offending candy snatcher. the problem we are trying to solve is how to trigger the silly string shooter. they are using lego nxt to fire the silly string.

researcher not a teacher but leading the lessons), the only things i have noticed are : the children may think that when you ask a sprite to \"say something\" it will literally say it and are dissappinted when the text comes up. the children are surprised when i learn from them. sometimes i have discovered little parts of scratch things that i didnt know through the children. on the other hand children get surprised when i say i will have to go away to find out what they have asked me and come back to them the following week with an answer to their problem. amanda\\n\\namanda, thank you for your response. i also experienced the second two comments that you mentioned. there is so much to learn from scratch and i found that children were much more willing to explore and try out different commands to see what happened with them. i am a student teacher and we taught scratch to a class of year 5\\'s, they loved it, and i learnt so much more about the software. thank you again. naomi\\n\\nthe mostfrequent misconception that i encounteredis that the \"if\" block is expected to work likea \"forever if\" block. it is not clear to manychildren that an \"if\" checks its condition

seem reasonable. while i don\\'t necessarily have suggestions for changing the project parameters or suggestions, i wondered how the project is being introduced. is this their first scratch project? are you going to show sample projects of what this project might look like? ah, one picky legal-ese style suggestion for the project parameters: i assume that the students will know that \"including backgrounds or costumes\" also implies programming those elements to change, not just to have them there, but not visible... :) k\\n\\nkaren, thanks for the suggestions. no, this is not their first project, but i have one really recalcitrant high school junior who can\\'t think of any concept to base a project on. today, he came up with a picture of the local police station as the background and wants to program a sprite to throw an egg at it. so, being ever-so-grateful that he even thought of something, i started to show him how to create costumes of a person in different positions to simulate throwing an egg. i also have a very talented senior in that class, and i am anxiously looking forward to what she creates. thanks for the reminder to use the hide command to hide a background/costume. herb\\n\\nthanks rick, i hadn\\'t thought about a specific target audience for which the students are creating; good idea. i see the purpose as a way to get my students being creative about something that they can relate to...instead of my assigning a specific topic or set of instructions that they have to make happen. regards, herb moyer\\n\\n', '14791': \"the weekly

received permission to use scratch in my high school object oriented programming class. in the oo class, we program in java an asteroid game. next year i am thinking about preceding the full-blown java version of the asteroid game with a scratch version that concentrates on the geometry of the moving spaceship. daniel green has kindly posted an excellent explanation of how the geometry works, and how to present it in scratch. with that said, i am just starting to think about how i can use scratch with high school students, so i am open to all suggestions.\\n\\ni instruct a multlevel (2-8) technology enrichment course at st. joan of arc school in hershey, pa. we use scratch, alice and interactive c (with handyboards) as our primary platforms. scratch is the dominant platform. we typically have the students look at a couple of classic video games (asteroids, pong) and vote on which one they want to program. we then work with them to decompose the game into functions and we ask them to suggest how they would solve that function. it often takes many sessions to get a game together. we have experimented with different lengths of sessions, different mixes of technologies (e.g. programming versus hands-on experiments), etc. i'm interested in helping teachers in southeastern pennsylvania integrate innovative tools into their stem curriculum. my main reason for attending here is to a) make contacts and b) see how you go about teaching the teachers.\\n\\nat the scratch media labs course yesterday, i was working with a teacher who was unable to create a recursive sorting

what is more commonly used? or more importantly what term is a better explanation of what they are doing? 2. what should i tell the students they are called? for example: video game designers, programmers, developers. which description is the most appropirate for what they will be doing? 3. what is the best way to describe scratch? i know in the scratch videos created by scratch it is referred to as a programming language. is it correct to always refer to it as the scratch programming languge? is fine to say, \" today you will learn how to use the scratch program\"? i taught with scratch in the past but that course was a summer camp and there wasn\\'t enough time to cover too much. the program i\\'m developing now is longer and much more involved in the terms and goes into the many types of projects that can be created with scratch (the first projects will be animated stories and interactive art). thank you for any advice you can give! best, t\\n\\nhi tiffany, it\\'s exciting to hear about your new video game course. have you thought of calling it \"creative computing\"?

a group of my students had a ball with picoboards and a parent volunteer, who came in to help them make scratch-based music. he had a prototype of a slide guitar/scratch project they played with over and over. karen r.\\n\\nthanks for getting back to me. yes it is an external sensor board i\\'m looking for. basically we have a budget to spend that isn\\'t huge -nothing new there. we are lacking in control technology and i\\'ve been looking at the lego kits to use in conjunction with scratch. although scratchboards went over to pico\\' they are only available to buy from the us and they are $50 each - which is pushing things for us as we are a tiny school. if we need parts or support it is then limiting for us being in the uk. i\\'m also looking at go control software from dataharvest - ineed to be able to use and external sensor for this too. so everything needs to be compatible with the external sensor boards. i\\'m just trying to make sure we get good value for our money and that idon\\'t leave a can of worms for whomever takes this job over while i\\'m on maternity leave next year. hope the above makes sense!\\n\\nif you are looking for something to link programming and external inputs, it is hard to beat connecting scratch with either one of these choices. you can do so much more than with the software side of the inputs, and kids will know the program to use in other contexts without the outside sensors. i have to add, though, that i haven\\'t used sensor gadgets from other companies to compare. i don\\'t know pricing for wedos, but choosing where to spend the money, you could consider: wedo motors are lots of fun, programming movement like animatronics, toys, etc. downside is you also need to buy lego pieces, gears and such. picoboards have lots of different input options--sound, light, resistance, switch. they are great for making game controllers, science experimenting, unusual inputs for graphic design projects. you can use all sorts of found materials in building, no extra purchase needed. they are pricey, and don\\'t have the motor option for the movement projects kids enjoy.\\n\\nis there any pointer or documentation to what or how to do the \"scratch-based music / prototype of a slide guitar/scratch project,\"that sounds very interesting and like something that you\\'d be hard pressed to pry the students off of. (in a good way...)\\n\\ni don\\'t have anything official. here\\'s what it involved: guitar 1. understand that one input option for picoboards is measuring resistance in a circuit. 2. make a guitar prototype (the parent version was fancy--miniature rock-style body from plywood attached to a fretboard). cover the fretboard with a conductive material--he used a thin black spongy material with some metal component new to me. make the slide from a film can wrapped in tin foil. 3. attach wires to the board, can and sratchboard in a way that moving the can up and down the board will change the length of the circuit and impact the resistance measured. 4. write a scratch script that plays sounds at different pitches depending on the resistance variable. drumpad same idea, with tinfoil on the drumsticks and the foamy-stuff on the pad. when the sticks touch the pad, a circuit closed and the scratch script played the drum sound.\\n\\ndepending you may look at the \\'virtual\\' pico board -

and sensors from a very old lego system that connected to the computer (from about 1988 i think). i\\'d like to be able to adapt them to work with the scratch software. is it as simple as figuring out which wire is the hot wire and which is the ground to run a motor? or sensor? do i need a resistor in the line to keep to much power from being drawn for the motors? i\\'m very new to scratch, but everything i\\'ve read indicates that tinkering and expanding is welcomed. is that true for people making their own interfaces? i ordered a wedo interface, but $50 seems like a lot for what i should

good way to use scratch for a fifth grader who struggles with reading. any ideas or suggestions would be helpful. thank you!\\n\\nhello jessica, say a little more about the context for your scratch work with this student. is this part of a scratch class and he/she is having trouble reading the scripts, or are you tutoring and looking for ways scratch can turn him/her on to reading? if the latter, some of the story-telling projects might be fun to try. for example, have the student take some photos around school, make a scratch slide show that is just a sprite switching costumes (the imported photos), then record narration about what the photos say about the school as a special place. link that to reading a picture book about special places such as a quiet place by douglas woods or when i was young in the mountains by c. rylant. if you're thinking more about using scratch as a way to practice specific skills, how about having the student make a flash card game that features the sight words he/she most needs to memorize? the words appear on the screen (sprite costumes again), pause for reading, then have a voice recording that says the word for the student to check. or, if none of this fits, keep asking! karen r.\\n\\niam tutoring her andlooking forideas to turn her on to reading. shejust began using scratchand likes paying attention to the details for the finished

people have discussed setting up scratchr on the scratch forums, here and here.\\n\\nkaren, any suggestions on what to do for a \"scratch classroom\" group login? i\\'d like the students to be able to post their projects to scratch.mit.edu under a central \"classroom\" login but i\\'d also like to avoid the more adventurous students experimenting with changing the group login password and so on. there was some discussion of this at the scratch@mit conference. any thoughts? best regards, -- dang\\n\\nah, good question. for those who weren\\'t there -- at scratch@mit, we presented the idea of scratch clubs, which was one way for educators to be better connected to participant/student content and contributions. unfortunately, the original design didn\\'t fit the different things people wanted. :) we\\'ve put the project on hold indefinitely. so, there isn\\'t a mechanism for centralized login in the current system that avoids the potential for password or email hacks. what about having individual logins, but setting up galleries to aggregate projects? anyone else have stories or experiences of the shared login? k\\n\\nit\\'s taken a fair ammount of tweaking, but i finally have a moodle course serving scratch projects. i don\\'t have a class to try it with right now, so if anyone would like to take it for a test drive, i\\'d love to hear from you. since i\\'m not using anywhere near my alotted bandwith at the moment i\\'d be glad to host a few assignments in a closed environment. here\\'s an example: www.rickashby.com/catalyst the \"questions and comments\" has an example of a nested forum with embedded projects hosted on my site.\\n\\ni noticed that glogster.com/edu has an option to \"register a virtual class up to 200 students.\" maybe that\\'s a way to go or at least explore. google apps for education also allows adding student accounts, but neither of those are exactly a scratch club nor are either of them exactly a trivial exercise to implement. 8^) anyone else seen anything similar where you can as a teacher or administrator maintain the usual block/disable/enable/reset-password routines for student accounts without having students hit the reset button on your admin account?\\n\\ndaniel\\'s question from sept. 16 is exactly the question i wanted to ask. i have two classes of 5th graders who created individual scratch projects to animate diagrams of plant and animal cells. they drew sprites for each part of the cell and created scripts so a label will appear and voice read aloud the name of each part as it is clicked. they were really excited about the project and i would like to let students shareit with a larger audience, but to add their projects individually on the scratch site would require me to get get permission from 48 parents. i started to set up a class membership and a gallery for this project, but then i realized that if students logged in, they could also change the password or make other unauthorized changes. has anyone developed a solution for this? pam\\n\\nhi pam, unfortunately, the two options you described (separate accounts with the hassle of permission-seeking vs. centralized account with hazard of unauthorized changes or inappropriate postings) are the only options we currently have available. k\\n\\ni always used the class membership method and never had any trouble with kids changing the settings. it might be worth giving your students the benefit of the doubt. if you dont want to tempt them too much, you could change the password yourself right after they the class submits projects.\\n\\nwith 2nd grade i have had them use my login to post animations. that worked fine. i am a big believer in opeing things up and trusting students. with older students my school has done a lot with google apps. i think it is a much better way to go than moodle because it is user-centered. 5th graders can set up the site themselves. have done a lot of sharing of data that way. but i have not tried it with scratch yet.\\n\\nhi pam... what i did was set up a pattern password for each class so i could remember any classes password. then i created a scratch account for any classroom. i named them  \"rayschool23\" for room 23. before they came in to class to post their completed projects as a final step; i changed the password to 232323. they can then post their projects, and when they leave, i change it back to my patterned password (23xxxxxx, say, put what you want instead of xxxxxx) i encourage them to get individual accts. at home with their parents\\' help. i was working with 5th graders. for 2nd and 3rd graders, i just posted their projects and put up links to them. see: http://rayschool.org/pinksheet/2010/03/25/third-grade-haiku/ http://rayschool.org/room15 for example let me know if you have any questions\\n\\ni\\'ve just created a scratch plugin for moodle based vles to allow students to upload and review their work to a forum on their school vle. http://scratched.media.mit.edu/resources/scratch-filter-moodle hope it\\'s useful.\\n\\nwhen we did this with a 6th grade language arts project, we created a grade level login and password. during class they would upload the newest version using that login and password. students were not only assesed on the quality of their own work, but also on the feedback and comments they left for their peers!\\n\\nhello, i wonder if there are any new developments in the scratch 2.0 world for creating shared libraries for groups of students....is it possible on the scratch 2.0 site for a group of students to view and share each others work, other than viewing and sharing with the entire scratch community?\\n\\ncode.org has something that ireally liked that i hope could be done with scratch. rather than requiring an email to register, teachers set up their educator account and can then set up individual sections or classes. they get a code for students to use when they register, then students can sign up with just a user name, password, and the course code. if something like that could be done with scratch that would be perfect for education - especially with elementary school kids.\\n\\nhi karen, we stuck in between while configuring the scratch server in our local system. could you please tell us to whom we need to contact for the solution.\\n\\nhi karen, could you please

task of learning scratch themselves might overwhelm them. to counter that objection, she recalled this old jewish fable: a farmer visits his rabbi and says \"rabbi, my house is too small. there is my wife with all her furniture and the kids with their pets, and the walls are closing in!\". the rabbi replies: \"you\\'re a farmer, yes? you have pigs? goats? cows?\" the fellow nods, and the rabbi says: \"move the pigs into the house.\" \"what!?\" \"just do it.\" the man goes home, and following instructions, he moves the pigs into the house. and the next time he visits the rabbi, he says: \"rabbi, these pigs are mucking up the place, and there is less room than before!\" \"move the goats and cows into the house.\" \"huh?!\" the man says, but he actually returns to his home with his wife and her furniture, the kids and their pets, plus the newly-resident pigs, and he manages to stuff the other farm animals into the house. again he returns to the rabbi, now with an escalated tale of woe and insufficient living space. the rabbi says: \"ok, move the farm animals back outside.\" and when he returns the cows and goats, the farmer sees much more space in his home, though the pigs are still in it. he realizes that things aren\\'t as bad as they seem, they can always get worse. -30- to me, that seemed like a fine story to tell her teachers who thought adopting scratch would be the proverbial straw on a camel\\'s back. but they continue to decline, she said. then she tells me a related episode about introducing alice to her students, some of whom were uninspired because they thought the alice environment was too much to handle. but when scratch entered the picture, those kids were pleased to find scratch\\'s ui less intimidating, and worked happily in her classs for the remainder of the year. i said: that\\'s like my story. when i thought to start teaching programming, i looked for a teaching language to learn, but i couldn\\'t deal with alice. then scratch showed up, and i\\'m running with it. then i realized that by giving up on alice before embracing the less-weighty scratch, her students and i were also farmers moving animals in and out of the house.\\n\\nit was nice to meet so many different educators, however i would have liked to do or make more things. i really need to see, do, and make more projects so i can bring them back to my school site as examples to convince a reluctant admin and staff. i felt like it was too much talking and not enough making.\\n\\nthink we\\'d get sufficient interest in a regular meet, in the common pizza-plus-presentations format?\\n\\n', '12519': \"hi everyone, my apologies for the program delay. it's now available online at http://events.scratch.mit.edu/conference/program.html if you're a presenter and would like to modify the title/presenters of your session, please send me an email. thanks! k\\n\\n\", '1209': 'i\\'m developing a workshop proposal for using scratch in secondary english classes and hope i might be able to get some input and feedback. to begin with, i need to decide how to focus my presentation. here are a few strands of thought i\\'ve considered: exploring the parallells between games and traditional narratives, particularly how most state standards of learning for literature can be taught through video games. using scratch as an new approach to reader response theory. developing cross curricular projects (and helping humanities teachers tap into stem funding streams) teaching the process of composition with an emphasis on how new collaboration platforms and the fluidity of digital media change the traditional \"plan, draft, revise, edit, publish\" approach. exploring \"kenetic text\" and how timing, location, color, and font have an impact on the meaning of a text (expanding the definition of literacy). creating relevant writing projects- reviewing projects, publishing a scratch newspaper, producing a scratch series. integrating scratch with moodle. what would you want to learn more about? which ideas need more clarificatioin?\\n\\nidon\\'t have any input for you right now, but iam in total support of this idea, especially for els learners.\\n\\nthis sounds great. i like the idea of using scratch to blur the boundary between stories and games. don\\'t know if this will be helpful, but i put together a collection of stories (broadly conceived) constructed with scratch for a pixar demo. the collection is available at http://web.media.mit.edu/~kbrennan/pixar/\\n\\n\"teaching the process of composition with an emphasis on how new collaboration platforms and the fluidity of digital media change the traditional \"plan, draft, revise, edit, publish\" approach. \" has my vote. it reflects the whole converstaion about how school changes to reflect kids\\' digital lives\\n\\ncan you add to the list or thing of another frame to use? both games and traditional narrative can, and typically do, have: common structural components conflict protagonist antagonist setting plot- cause and effect, escalating stakes exposition p.o.v. variety of genres continum from abstract to concrete- checkers is abstract; grand theft auto is concrete. parrables are abstract; novels are concrete. variety of purposes- both can be theraputic, instructional, entertaining. dynamic characters common audience experiences make, test, and revise predictions make choices resopnd emotionally build community can be approached with multiple strategies frequently require multiple passes to \"resolve.\" safely explore threatening experiences.\\n\\nadding to the list of similarities above, writers and game makers must both have the abilitity to identify with their audiences. they have to be able to imagine, on a moment by moment basis, how their audience will probably react to what has just happened. on to the next big question: why bother it\\'s fun may be particularly interesting to boys who are commonly read to solve problems: reading don\\'t fix no cheveys it\\'s high interest topic. students have significant prior knowledge about playing games. relevent themes/ essential questions: interplay of tech and art, quest for mastery, ethics of art, interplay of culture and personal choice, can be easily extended with nonfiction readings: the scratch manual, the scratch website, news articles, editorials 21st century literacy: composition must be taught as a multimedia endevour, game production lends itself to collaboration. designing and developing interactive presentations will be an essential skill. writing games and training simulations is a growing profession.\\n\\ni\\'m very concrete, so in addition to this framing, i\\'d love to hear more about particular activities you\\'re thinking about...\\n\\ni agree. the next big question is howdoyoudoit? i think the best way to get people inspired by scratch is to let them play with it. after providing a quick introduction, i plan to let participants work through a project as if they were students. the trick that i have run into in class is creating an assignment that provides the right balance structure and autonomy. it\\'s all fun and games. . . even when somebody looses an eye my first idea is to base the lesson on a short familiar story, odysseus\\' encounter with the cyclops. www.wsu.edu/~dee/minoa/poly.htm after reading the story, particpants will work in triads to create a game inspired by the story. based on the technique of pairs programming, there will be a driver (sitting at the keyboard) and a navigator (reading the criteria and scratch cards. in addition, there will be a research and development role will reffer to the original text and search or creating necessary resources (costumes & sound effects). participants will then use a rubric and review template to give feedback to other projects. finally, participants will be given reflection questions, a few general, and a few taylored to the role they played in their production team. i\\'ll be working on creating specific materials over then next few days.\\n\\ni like the idea of roles. i would like to suggest that the roles be interchangeable after a while eg. if the time allocated for the project is 40 minutes, will it be a good idea to change roles after 20 minutes so that students get to see from a different perspective. an idea to share: how about creating a scenario as in you paint a particular scratch background and let your students put in their characters. for example, using the desert background imported from scratch, have the students discuss desert people, animal and plant life and things associated with the desert. then form into groups and let them create a project. they must start in the desert but can choose to leave the desert so you can include means of transportation in your brainstorming session. have fun!\\n\\nthe trick that i have run into in class is creating an assignment that provides the right balance structure and autonomy. i couldn\\'t agree more. finding that \"just enough, but not too much\" spot is such a challenge! i thought your use of triads was interesting. do people get a chance to rotate through the roles?\\n\\nhi. loved the stories. really wonderful. thanks for highlighting them. just to let you know that i was able to view all except for worst day ever , the third story which did not open. you may want to check that out.\\n\\nit\\'s interesting that i got two comments about changing roles. this is a topic that i\\'ve discussed with colleagues before. i tend to keep people in the same roles for much longer than other teachers i know. when doing project work, my inclination is to keep students in the same role for at least two or three projects. my day-to-day workgroups may keep the same roles for as long as six weeks. i think that constantly changing roles creates a fragmented experience for students. it\\'s better for them to master one skill-set than to dabble in all of them. in the context of a workshop for teachers, i\\'d offer the option of changing roles if there is time to produce more than one project. the problem with the format i originally described is that not everyone actually gets to put their hands on scratch. so perhaps i need to schedule individual play time at the end of the session.\\n\\ni really like this idea. especially as it creates an opportunity for a cross curricular project. from an english point of view you have an opportunity to reinforce the different types of conflict. this project would probably be \"man vs. nature,\" unlike typical action games that tend to be \"man vs. man.\" from the science perspective, you have an opportunity to research ecosystems. and concepts from social studies, such as wants/needs. and environmental factors that lead to the development of cities could be incorporated.  also, from a programming/math perspective, i see a great opportunity to use variables to track

different groups place their characters in deserts in different countries/continents. you can also bring in the idea of desert wars for example, for a history angle. for example, the character portrays a person who is fighting in the desert or a person who is living in the midst of a desert war, etc. there is so much to choose from...\\n\\nhi. moodle is new to me. can you explain how you can integrate moodle with scratch? by the way, i have another suggestion for you to try out - in the area of writing, perhaps you may want to use the idea of oral presentations via scratch pages to explore personal family history. for example, i am trying to preserve some old teochew rhymes which i learnt as a child. please see http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/aitan/736471 in this project and other similar projects which i will be creating, i hope to be able to publish these rhymes so that my children and grandchildren (if any) etc can benefit from it. in singapore, chinese dialects are dying through non-usage as we speak mainly english or mandarin, malay, tamil and other languages. many of us live as nuclear families and our children are not exposed to the dialects which their grandparents speak. i must confess that my knowledge of teochew is limited and that of my children even less. as the older generation dies out, we will lose our dialects eventually. i would appreciate any ideas you may have for my preserving my teochew heritage project. thanks. best regards, ai boon\\n\\nhi. any ideas about how to use the three string operator blocks (join, letter of, length of) in

about the learning objectives and goals that the students will be achieving so that they can measure how much they have learnt, on their own and get excited by their progress when they see it happen.

it has a lot of capabilities. ----- notes by laura johnson pam _ inherited a curriculum that she tweaked and is coming from an ap computer science background (more traditional) _ has to make a shift

activities or approaches to introduce scratch to beginners? at the moment, i really like something from this set: 8 blocks: create any project given a particular set of eight scratch blocks. monkey business: (with very little introduction to the scratch user interface, just showing how to snap blocks together) create a project where something surprising happens to a monkey. interactive me: (with a walkthrough of how to create an interactive sprite) create an interactive project that helps others learn about you and the people, issues, and things you care about. what do you do?\\n\\ni\\'m still learning scratch, but i took the risk of staying one lesson ahead of the kids this year and taught it in our computer lab. i used the how to use scratch intro video from the videos page on the scratch website as the very first exposure. this gets the students curious and interested to get in and explore on their own. i guide them through all the \"buttons\", give them some exploratory time, and then they start a simple walkthrough lesson. this introduces the concepts of deleting and painting new sprites, switching costumes, and using the forever block. it\\'s very simple, and we don\\'t get into naming sprites or importing them just yet. the stage stays blank, too. from this point, some students are going to rocket off on their own and start self-directed learning, trying out new blocks and jazzing up this lesson. for others, it at least makes it seem easy to do, and they are willing to do some more tutorials to get some projects done. i like doing a step-by-step tutorial like this at the beginning because it allows all students to have a feeling of success, and this gets their interest peaked. although, at our advanced users scratch summer camp, the kids really breezed right through this and were eager to move on to something more challenging. the projects that are included in scratch are great examples, too.\\n\\nmy museum uses scratch both in our museum for summer classes and workshops and in local libraries. because we\\'re sometimes working in drop-in settings where we might have a youth come in and spend time anywhere from 5 to 60 minutes, we\\'ve started to introduce scratch in a whole new way: we have computers set up with scratch running, and invite youth to come and try the a \\'new\\' program called scratch. we have scratch projected on a screen and withing a minute or two we\\'ll show them how to do a couple things: click on the word \\'file\\' in the menu, then go down to \\'open\\' then show them the \\'examples\\' button over on the leftr side of the window that pops up. normally once we get this far they\\'re off exploring - and ignoring us ( until they have a question). we\\'ll show how to open the folders to the youth who\\'re interested and then call out to everyone how if you click once on a project name in the folder list, you get a preview. finally once they have the program open we try to get their attention ( we see them ignoring us as they mess about with scratch as a very good thing) and show them that that green flag button will often get the program started. sometimes the room suddenly becomes noisy with sound, and sometimes not - if not we\\'ll prompt them that some of the projects make sound or music ( and sometimes this is where we need to help get sound working ( if available)) this usually ends up being 15-30 minutes. whats been very suprising ( and a bit unerving even) is that we\\'re finding we do not have to tour the youth through the program buttons and menus - and in fact when we\\'ve stuck to a tour of scratch ( beyond file/open/green flag) they\\'re often not listening and moving ahead on their own. we\\'ve been calling this our \\'just in time\\' introduction. what can follow is dropping a scratch card next to computers, or simply getting everyones attention once they\\'ve begun, and showing them how to draw a sprite ( and thats the next discussion)\\n\\ni\\'ve been teaching scratch for about 2 or 3 years, whenever i first found out about it. i download the scratch video and the kids love watching that, about how they can do these projects too just by \"messing around.\" then i introduce the blocks, noting color and what they each do. after that, i take out one of the cards from the scratch site, an easy one like maybe the ghost gliding, and then they are hooked. but, i don\\'t let them go free yet... no, imake them do enough until it\\'s 5 min. till end of class. then they play. then next time, i finish the cards and give them little assignments. before you know it, they have taken off in 10 directions. i find if they don\\'t have enough knowledge before they are set free that they just pile the sprites onto one another. but, if they know how to make them move then it goes much better!\\n\\ni typically work with kids from 6 yrs up to 10 yrs who have no scratch/programing experience at all in small groups (6-12 at a time). we havebeenusingpicoblocks but i keep a laptop on the side of our classroom withvariousscratch applications i\\'ve coded. the first thing i do is ask who has used a computer before and similar questions, the point being to take them from feeling unfamiliar with the whole thing straight to \"oh, yeah i guess i have more experience than i thought.\" then i explain how a computer only does what you tell it to. i briefly imitate a robot and get them to \"program\" me by giving me audible commands. i set a goal of making me get across the room and pick up an object. i have a lot of fun with i and they do to. for example, they figure out to tell me \"start walking\" pretty quickly but become highly amused when i walk straight ahead into the wall. this segues into a brief run down of some of the things you can do with the system. then i give everyone their lego sets and let them spend some time doing nothing but working with the pieces. next, we pick our first project and off we go! with this age group and time constraints running from 5 days of 4 hour classes or even one day of 3 hours, i have to do a lot ofpre-planning and maintain aflexiblelesson plan. i am also teaching at a museum so 1)they are paying to be there 2) we want them to come back 3) they don\\'t have to come back! so i make sure that they know about my basic rules from day one... if we\\'re not having fun, we are doing something wrong. there are no wrong answers in my classroom because you can learn from anything. we share materials and help each other. that\\'s pretty much it. i also do not stand for \"telling on each other.\" in my small environment, i am aware of everything that goes on. most of the time when a student complains about another student, they were sharing in the alleged \"trouble\" up until they decided to get the other one in trouble. mystudentsreadily accept this as i explain everything in a way that they can understand andrelateto instead of as a \"way it is\" rule. i get their sympathy with this by asking them \"what happens we we have to stop having fun so i can handle problems?\" \"do we want to lose the little time we have to play over silly stuff?\" basically, i use empathy as often as i can. it is not about you, me, or them, it is about us. of course no plan is perfect so even if i have to address a student one on one, i make sure that they feel as though we are 2 people talking instead of me coming across like the light-flickering school teacher demanding/begging for their attention. i am very fortunate to be working in such a wonderful setting. i am allowed to step outside the normal teaching boundaries imposed in the public school system and i getexcellentresults. my students often do not want to take theirbreak time. at the end of the day, i have to make them go home. they beg to know about more classes, where to purchase the supplies we use, and they show up for the next set of classes. it probably helps that i am a born performer so i have an intuitive knack for reading people and situations. i also pride myself on thinking outside the box. our town is rather small and sometimes can feel bleak. we are extremely lucky just to have the facilities we use. so i repeatedly resort to my own provenmethodology... immediately knock them sideways with something they aren\\'t expecting, now you\\'ve got their attention and better yet their interest, now con them into thinking that this is all just a big fun playtime. once they go into \"we\\'re having fun mode\" i can cram an unbelievable amount of knowledge in at every opportunity cause know we\\'re not learning, we\\'re playing. i was a gifted student who was failed by the school system. i also come from a long line of educators. i see instructors time and time again who seem to act like they themselves were programmed (somewhat poorly) by someone using scratch. and my heart goes out to all the teachers who have been constrained by administrators and dogooderswho understand bottom lines far better than a random child standing in front of them. i do it because i love it and there is nothing more infectious than that. i guess i hindsight, maybe school didn\\'t fail me after all. from conflict comes action!\\n\\nthanks for sharing what you do. i find it helpful. i am working on developing a program to teach scratch to younger children in the age group 6 to 9. best regards, ai boon\\n\\nkeith braafladt said \"whats been very suprising ( and a bit unerving even) is that we\\'re finding we do not have to tour the youth through the program buttons and menus...\" i think there has been a huge shift in the way that kids learn. older generations were as a rule more prone to be wary of hitting the \\'wrong\\' button. newer generations already know concepts so instead of not hitting the buttons, they punch away. this is because they are familiar with and expecting/looking for concepts... save, delete, enter, reset, etc. personally i suspect that this gives them somewhat of a leg up on various learning curves.\\n\\n', '46488': 'i created my class and accounts for my students. i assigned a password(that is the same for all students) that student will change once they

notes: tom kowalczykshared some of the work that he\\'s doing in the domain of k-12 workforce development. anushka paulshared the project she developed during the meetup, based on the collision game from the let\\'s play handouts. abby millershared resources that she developed for her students (step-by-step and scratch puzzles) and will hopefully share on scratched! jesse raymondshared a space-themed project he created that models gravity. 2. for the beginners after showing various sample projects to demonstrate the possibilities of scratch creation, we had an hour and a half of hands-on time with scratch. the suggested activity was to create an interactive collage, but several different paths were explored including trying out the scratch card activitiesand checking out the scratch sample projects that come with scratch (e.g. simple circuits). if yesterday was your first experience with scratch (or you want a refresher), here are some other resources that you might want to check out, to support your further explorations with scratch. getting started guide - how to make a first scratch project. design studio activities - 16 suggestions for design activities, such as making a project that includes the \"random\" block or making a project that has an orange square and purple circle. creative computing workshop - this is a sequence of activities for getting started with scratch. any feedback on the sequence and activities would be appreciated. how could it be changed to be more useful? 3. intermediate breakout those with more experience followed a few different tracks, but several people got together to explore scratch\\'s game-making potential, with some people using the let\\'s play handouts as a reference and others pursuing their own challenges, such as implementing a version of pac-man. 4. future events there are lots of ways to keep participating in scratched professional development: hang out on scratched come to the monthly meetups - next month\\'s meetup is a bit different, as it coincides with scratch day. registration for scratch day mit opens at the beginning of may. attend the monthly webinars - the next webinar is all about

kids (ages 8 and up)! this workshop by stephen howell will provide the means by which anybody age 8 and up can develop their own interactive motion-capture games for the kinect! using kinect2scratch (a free bridging library developed by the presenter), the workshop will demonstrate 5-minute game creation with the free scratch language, and provide methods for interfacing kinect skeleton data (the users body joints) into scratch programs. many primary and secondary schools have no formal programming instruction at any level, and evangelizing computational thinking and logical problem-solving is a major challenge. scratch, a free educational tool from mit, addresses this by framing computer programming as a curiosity-driven, arts-oriented, creative activity  in a building block environment which students and teachers can learn very easily. more than 2 million programs, many of which are interactive games, have been written and shared by young people using the scratch language. the kinect depth sensor offers young programmers enticing possibilities for new forms of game design, but as c# and c++ are not languages in which they are likely to be skilled, kids cant easily write code for the kinect. until now. with scratch, a kinect, and the bridging software provided in this workshop, a teacher can have a class writing motion-capture based games very quickly!

(a challenge further compounded by the very buggy paint editor!) there are multiple ways of implementing the \"matching\" check. for example, derek used an \"invisible target\" approach and i used a coordinate-checking mechanism. (i liked derek\\'s approach more!) there are multiple ways of implementing the internal-organ dragging. for example, making the individual sprites draggable versus having the individual sprites follow the mouse pointer. generally, i thought that this was going to be a super easy project, but it was more involved than i anticipated -- and could easily be done with scratch 1.4, not really an exploration of new features in scratch 2.0. an interesting learning experience overall! i\\'m sure i\\'m missing details -- i hope my fellow breakout group members will add their comments/reflections/reactions! k\\n\\n', '10584': \"the weekly roundup is where the scratched team shares some of the major -- as well as some of the overlooked -- news, stories, and events related to scratch that took place throughout the week. scratched weekly roundup 09/10/11 - 09/16/11 please note that there will not be a scratched meetup at mit tomorrow. we are shifting meetups this year to the first saturday of each month, starting with saturday, october 1. meetup with us! this week, the new tech post published an article and video about last week's microsoft ireland's event, featuringstephen howell's kinect2scratch software. -http://newtechpost.com/2011/09/12/the-possibilities-of-kinect stephen howellwill also be hosting a workshop about kinect2scratch at the art && code conferenceat carnegie mellon university on october 22. -http://artandcode.com/3d/workshops/2c-teaching-kids-programming-with-scratch-kinect sarah ludwig wrote about getting started with scratch on the young adult library services association (yalsa) blog. she will also be presenting scratch at the yalsa midwinter institute in 2012. -http://yalsa.ala.org/blog/author/sludwig/ david holford from the branston community academy in the uk introduced year five students at the washingborough foundation primary schoolto scratch. -www.washingborough.lincs.sch.uk/ in spain this weekend, milla digital is holding a three-day workshop on scratch + arduino (s4a). -https://www.zaragoza.es/ciudad/sectores/tecnologia/tecno/ficha_agenda?codigo=73601 these are just a few things that we found. do you have news from the week that you'd like to share?

scratch to elementary-level students for a couple of years, and have tried to purchase or review nearly every book on scratch that i can get my hands on. this is truly one of the best books i have reviewed. it contains many examples and projects that i can present to the students as a group, or have them try on their own. some of the examples are simple enough to illustrate just enough of what i\\'m trying to teach (for example, how to use the stamp tool), or lengthy enough to present as a challenge that encompasses multiple types of blocks or processes for a great learning experience. i appreciate the step-by-step projects and the visual guidance. if my classes were longer, i would certainly use this book as the \"text book\" to follow. as it stands now, my 6-week/once-per-week courses don\\'t quite allow for that kind of depth, but i am able to extract many of the books samples to offer quite a lot of breadth into my courses. this book also really takes a scratch user from the basic concepts of programming that is so available even to the casual scratcher, to truly deeper concepts (such as nested loops, recursion, physics and advanced equations). i have yet to follow

interested in exploring during breakout sessions. breakout sessions - four different breakout sessions emerged. many participants new to scratch were interested in having an introductory session, which rosemary volunteered to organize around building up a maze project. lorraine hosted a show & tell to share recent student work and adam facilitated a discussion on supporting intermediate

(maybe you have that in the full book.) thanks for sharing this useful link, even if you are the author!\\n\\nhopefully, you enjoyed your fortunes. the idea of incorporating explicit sections for \"what you can do with this\" is an interesting one and i\\'ve made a note of it for future revisions. the general format of the tutorials is that they start with specific steps (time for action) followed by reflections (what just happened) followed by more general discussions. it\\'s in this general discussion area that i tried to accomplish some of what your you\\'re suggesting. thank you for the feedback.\\n\\nthanks for all these good suggestions. by the way, karen, crystal is here now ( in virginia), she taught scratch at cardinal forest elem in springfield va last year. i hear she may be connecting with you this year. she\\'s talking now with the two students (seniors)teaching this year at cardinal forest. one student is using scratch with the younger grades, the other student is using storytelling alice with 4th graders. they go once a week on tuesdays. it\\'d be nice to keep up a connection with you all up at the media center.\\n\\nyes, i met with crystal a few weeks ago. i\\'m hoping that she\\'ll be joining our research group as an undergraduate researcher for the month of january. i\\'m really looking forward to learning more about her experiences teaching scratch at cardinal forest!\\n\\ni had lots of fun with the graphics--like my students, that part tends to take over from the programming. here is a link to the project: http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/room209/802067. i was also trying out wedo sensors, so it uses the distance sensor to \"read\" your palm. it is interesting to consider how to balance out \"discover it yourself when you need it\" teaching with scratch and instruction on specific elements as provided by your tutorials--when and how often to give kids step-by-step project directions. your work reminds me that no one approach fits all circumstances. for example, i don\\'t know much about programming with operator blocks like mod. from your lesson, i learn that it is a way of singling out a specific response in an otherwise random list (i think!)--and now have a new tool i wouldn\\'t have discovered on my own. as an elementary school teacher, i appreciate the push to the next level of programming your lesson provides.\\n\\n', '2362': \"hello, i know many logo inspired activities are on their way using scratch, so i am sorry for those listening to this post who are already very experienced about this approach; but those project are so many i need your opinion to choose which of them are most suitable for this kind of course (and especially which are the most already tested): - participants are first middle school grade (age 10-11) - no previous experience with programming but great interest to learn it - the course should be divided into small learning units, each having a clear and meaningful goal - the course is 30 hours long, each lab activity lasts for 2 hours - finally, i'd like to share the learning results of this course: the projects built by the students will go on scratch site but i'd like to share in a more formal and detailed way the pedagogical outcomes, if anyone is interested; - the first lesson will be next thursday, the entire course will end on late may thank you in advance\\n\\nis the object of the course to use scratch to introduce programming to kids?

differentiated instruction: demo of the scratch program. very basic take to the scratch site for the possibilities show the variety of subject areas that can be covered depends on time: the one hour thing: introduce scratch, then get them to start exploring the next part of the challenge: get a character to do a certain amount of movement next part is to share what you have done one hour covers: introduction exploration sharing reflection second hour covers: decide area: storytelling, games, simulations assign specific challenges (ideas for challenges: take certain blocks and create, take certain sprites and create) reflect on how it can be used in their discipline: teacher and tech person need to work togetherhow do you enable that? create curriculum in teams over the summer where the teams are content teacher and tech person what is the end goal of the pd? could you have the content teachers then teach their colleagues, as in train the trainer or is it to have the teachers have one unit that they can implement right away karen langs presentation at masscue: she got everyone to program together: group coding we will find her presentation on the masscue ning and share with others she used a sandbox approach ----- notes by laura johnson from the pd discussion at 11/10 meetup if you were holding a 1 hour pd session, what would you include? focus on tech skills rather than instructional support (i.e. how to use scratch rather than how to teach scratch) because -the curriculum guide and scratch cards are sufficient tools for learning how to incorporate scratch into the classroom -the pd leader cant know how scratch will fit into the curriculum of every teacher in the session, but can instruct everyone how to use the program -however, it is extremely helpful for the leader to be able to offer suggestions on how to adapt the program to use in certain subjects/classroom environments i.e. foreign language, science, etc. -teachers want: -to know what theyre teaching -to appear competent / a manual so they never look like they dont know something -to know how to assess student work -explicit links from a process to a scratch block key components are: 1st hour session -introduction to basic capabilities of the program -exploring the program through samples and hands-on activity -sharing/reflecting on possibilities of use in specific instructional settings 2nd hour session -hands-on challenge -more in depth tech support -context influences what types of things you need to learn within the program -can use context to preselect scratch blocks/features to explore -building topics based on groups of blocks there needs to be a shift from teacher/expert to responsible facilitator. scratch is a safe space for this type of shift _ kids and teachers are learning the program at the same time live coding (having scratch projected on a large screen while doing a group-think/crowd-sourced challenge) is a good way to bring this culture shift into a pd session -pd facilitator can model ways to deal with uncertainty/mistakes while showing how to use the program (example: karen lang _ masscue conference presentation) the format and content of a pd session depends on: time available school policy: is the pd on something that is being integrated one classroom at a time / on a voluntary basis or something that the administration has mandated for the whole school end goal: should the pd participants be able to complete 1 project with the edtech by the end or be able to use every aspect of the software? -depends on the participants most pd leaders want to be able to light a fire under more than one teacher at a time _ large group sessions are more valuable than 1 on 1 meetings, but its harder to customize those interactions relying on the kids to transfer their knowledge and skills to teachers isnt enough when you have a pd session with teachers from different subjects the format should be: demo overview of scratch site samples showing the capability of the program resources on scratched manual for initial training to scratch use guide isnt used people have different preferences regarding learning how to use the program. handout individual exploring challenges teachers are like kids in their enthusiasm for the program, but teachers want to get it right, want to understand whats going on meta-perspective: want to connect it to the classroom whose job is it to tie scratch to the curriculum? tech person + teacher -its a two way street that can move from a lesson plan to scratch integration or from scratch capabilities to lesson plan the ideal pd scenario is to work with specialized groups but a secondary way to get to that is following a train the trainer model teachers create their own specialized groups building off of the first, more general pd sessions and then can focus on tying things to their specific curricular topics ----- notes by rupangi sharma on scratch pd breakout session at the november 2012 meetup _ looking at a way to introduce educators who are new to scratch by reflecting on karen langs presentation (karen modeled her presentation atmasscueon thecs4hsworkshop atmitmedia lab). involving the audience of educators by making them program along with the presenter. _ involving them in programming in such a way that they are in the shoes of students and the presenter takes on the role of the educator- so the presentation gives educators a sample of what a classroom involved with programming through scratch looks like and gets hands- on experience. _ we also spoke about how it is necessary to show educators all that is possible with scratch- showing them the extent to which students can get creative with scratch. _ it was important, we noted, to also make scratch relevant to educators by showing them how scratch can be used in their classroom to teach their particular subject, whether it be science, math or performing arts. _ we discussed the importance of curriculum guides and resources like the cards but, we pointed out how sometimes the variety of resources available can be overwhelming so it is advisable to point to specific resources that educators who are new to scratch can use. _ the pd group wanted to see karen langs presentation on the scratch ed website\\n\\n', '28393': \"i love the grid toggle button in scratch jr. please add that to scratch 2.0. it would be soooo helpful to students.\\n\\ni think the best place to ask for features is in the scratch forums: http://scratch.mit.edu/discuss/1/ btw it's indeed a very helpful feature!\\n\\n\", '49779': 'help??

: each attendee filled out a who am i poster with a self-portrait and three things about themselves. these were posted to a wall for all to see. we then organized into lines and did 3 minute one-on-one introductions with people we hadnt met. agenda co-creating: the participants were challenged to co-create the schedule for the day by first, brainstorming ideas on idea stickies in small groups. ingrid and janet then rapidly grouped all the ideas and came up with our session topics for the day. breakout sessions: we had time for two 45 minute sessions with three topics in each. rosemary led a game project for those interested in getting started with scratch. another group met around math and science ideas for scratch and used muazzezs project to look into how we can implement tallies using a counting variable. a third group worked with the wedo kits building their own chain reaction based on the scratch + lego wedo chain reaction video. lunch discussion: ingrid shared the creative computing curriculum website. janet shared some resources on scratched including the student handbook for scratch and ecs. adam shared a wedo demonstration from his breakout session. announcements and resources: our google+ community is launched. search scratched-cambridge ma our schedule for the year is now set and posted to our eventbrite page. we look forward to seeing you at our next scratched -cambridge meetup on november 1, 2014.\\n\\n', '13675': \"the thursday, friday, and saturday keynote recordings are now available.\\n\\nhi karen, this is great! i'd love to see the saturday morning sharing session - is there any chance of that?

it seems excessive.\\n\\ni asked john maloney (the lead developer of scratch) about this, and here\\'s what he had to say: it\\'s a combination of several things -- first, scratch tries to keep thumbnails of sprites updated as the sprites change. although there are optimizations that save most of the work when nothing changes, it still takes some processing time just to check. when i first open scratch viewing the default project, scratch consumes about 2.5% of the cpu on my macbook pro. if i open a project with many sprites, it goes up to 4.3% however, there a more significant cycle consumer. the sound player seems to use about 11% of my cpu even when no sounds are playing. the sound player is started the first time any sound is played and it is never shut down after that. so scratch burns about 13.5% of the cpu time on my computer after playing a sound. finally, if you use the \"loudness\" or \"loud\" blocks, that opens the sound input channel, which seems to burn another 5%. i agree, this seems excessive for \"doing nothing\". scratch should probably turn off the sound input and output channels when they haven\\'t been used for a while.\\n\\nthanks!\\n\\n', '19414': \"seal point academy is very excited to announce that our workshop for teachers is full and the registration is closed. withn days of our announcement, 30+ teachers registered. thank you to scratch and other districts in supporting us to make this successful event. at the moment, we invite teachers to register for it to be waitlisted. in case your school is interested to have a conference in your computer lab, contact us. we will work on the professional credit for teachers and the logistics involved. the course content is : introduce scratch and computing for all ages ,and it will be at two or three day event. the course covers the strategies to launch a computing course in your class, school or district. thank you sincerely seal point academy sacramento, ca\\n\\nhi sankar, that's awesome! i hope to hear more about how the event was after the workshop. m\\n\\n\", '14130': \"i'm working in an after school program with teens that get bored easily. i've tried to inspire them with the online projects. they had absolutely no interest in that.it is nearly impossible to get through the exercises. as a last resort i asked them to just play around with the program. any ideas would be helpful.\\n\\nhi pamela, i find it sometimes helps if students can connect their work to something personally meaningful. is there something relevant going on at school or in the community that might make an interesting theme? one activity that we've used in the past with teens is the dance party activity. it can be especially fun to take pictures of individual students doing different dance moves and then have them animate themselves in scratch. students might also enjoy incorporating their favorite song or work collaboratively in groups. let me know what other ideas you come up with! m\\n\\nhi michelle, thank you so much. this is very helpful!! iwill try incorporating your suggestionsinto a plan andwill let you know how it goes. p\\n\\nglad to hear it was helpful! please keep me posted on how it goes. m\\n\\ni have some similar challenges. i teach 9th grade.i used the resources at shallwelearn.com and modified them into small projects. the students could follow them exactly as written, but got extra points for personalization. at the beginning, for most kids, that means playing with beats, music, and drawing tools, which most teens like. the more motivated kids personalized the programs in more sophisticated ways. i didn't do much explicit teaching at first, but began incorporating 5 min. do nows to review the use of certain blocks and logic structures, which allowed me to teach certain things they were having trouble with. after a couple of projects, i assigned them an open-ended design project. they work in pairs or individually, by their own choice. the kids have really taken their own interests and incorporated them into the projects, and most are at least moderately engaged. i have posted my do nows in the resource section, and could share other stuff if desired. i hope that helps! one continuing challenge is that the kids work at wildly different speeds, so figuring out when to set firm deadlines for finishing projects is tough.\\n\\nyou must be a excellent teacher. you give great advise. i will make use of your tips. i didn't know about shallwelearn.com, thank you for that. i have experimented in different ways with my students to interest them in learning scratch. the best results i got was with a maze game assignment which made them want to get the sprite through the maze. i too find it necessary to limit the amount of time spent on the exercises. i love your idea of an open-ended design project. the key i think is in allowing them to develop their own ideas. it is better to not be too controlling. thanks again kelly for you help.\\n\\nmy students love the dance party activity that was just mentioned by michelle chung. it really gets the kids up and moving and ties programming to something the students can relate to. one thing that motivated my students was to have them create games for a special education classroom. the difference in the quality of work went way up when they realized that they were not creating something justto get a passing grade. they loved the idea that they were creating something that would be used by other students.\\n\\n\", '26182': 'do you work with children ages 5-7?

2. i haven\\'t used galleries yet. it wasn\\'t until today that i started thinking about them, but i can imagine a lot of uses for them. we could create a gallery for each class, or even each project. perhaps galleries could be used to link project to specific curricula, by openning them up to the world and labelling them clearly. i created one now to get started with our next class project: http://scratch.mit.edu/galleries/view/62163. it will be interesting to see how it works.\\n\\ni really like the idea of connecting to true stories, and want to work that approach in to future workshops.i particularly love the elevator romance theme for the gallery!\\n\\nyes, having the students demonstrate their understanding of a story is powerful. the two main characters are stuck in an elevator for 19 hours. the students are able to \"de-construct\" the scene as depicted via the words in the story, but we are finding that they are, in fact, having difficulty inferring what the conversation may be between 2 strangers stuck on an elevator together (who later fall in love and get married!)most of them have the characters saying, \"hi, how are you?\" and the responses are mostly formulaic, \"i\\'m fine. how are you?\" it\\'s a step that needs more discussion.... on the other hand, our expectations for the project are constantly being \"upped\" in that we think they should be able to do certain things (change backgrounds, have the characters move, \"talk\" --and then someone learns how to record their voices and vroom! the rest of the group wants to learn how to record their dialogs! very exciting. i\\'m finding (via focus group) that some students prefer to use the\"big\" computers rather than the laptops. stay tuned.\\n\\ni\\'m finding (via focus group) that some students prefer to use the\"big\" computers rather than the laptops. i find that so interesting. most of the kids (and adults) i\\'ve worked with prefer the freedom of laptops. (although having a plug-in/non-integrated mouse is very frequently requested.) i look forward to hearing more about why that\\'s the case...\\n\\nwe\\'ve finished the second quarter and find that evaluation (in keeping with our jurisdiction\\'s guidelines) is problematic. there is no question that learning is occurring among our 25 student-community. in fact, the fact that we see ourselves as a true learning community somewhat adds to the difficulty of grading students. we have rubrics to guide them (and us), but our rubrics always seem to fall short. our students always seem to be able to surprise us with capabilities that we don\\'t foresee. for example, in our most recent project, the students imported 30\" of music--a skill not covered in our rubric. in summary, though, we continue to struggle with grading--content and skills. we observe how some students are able to work fast, help others, show creativity, use correct grammar and mechanics, and get the work done on time. we also observe less skilled students getting the help from those others and learning to the best of their (language and technical) ability. we attempt to pair students with different first languages in order to have them use language for authentic (and more rewarding on many levels) purposes. as a learning communicty, the class deserves an a. i\\'m not sure how the individuals will fare....\\n\\nthanks so much for sharing the update! we continue to struggle with grading--content and skills how much of the rubric is focused on language acquisition and how much on technical acquisition? is there any peer-evaluation component?\\n\\nhi ann, i am very interested in your language learning project. i clicked on the above link, but it doesn\\'t seem to active anymore. i realise that it has been five years since it was first posted and wondering if you could perhaps direct me to a more up-to-date resource regarding your research. kind regards, rose\\n\\n', '15428': 'i have just launched a blog, www.scratch-blog.com, where i share the mathematics and programming techniques used in the projects i upload to scratch (search popswilson). i write a detailed paper for each project and distribute these as pdf files, announced on the blog, and avaialble on request by sending an email to grandadscience@gmail.com. i will not upload any project in the future without documentation. the free-form environment offered by scratch is a wonderful place to play and create. but there are those users that are interested in mathematics and in acquiring new programming skills. my blog is designed to offer interested members of this group the opportunity to dive a bit deeper into mathematics and programming. visit my blog and find out if it interests you. if so, visit often. direct students to my blog. they might find an interesting topic or two to explore. the decision to start a blog originated from a comment a user made about my lindenmayer systems project uploaded to scratch. his comment was positive but also asked a question. how does that work? no math, science, or programmiing teacher can resist answering that question. so, trhe blog is my answer. to learn is to be alive!\\n\\nwhat an awesome blog! sharing!\\n\\n', '910': 'hi, has anyone created a curriculum that involves lego\\'s wedo set with scratch? any possibilities of creating a curriculum out of this combination?\\n\\nijust introduced wedo into our 5th grade classes for thier simple machines unit. beyond that, i\\'m looking to find other ways to get the kits into curriculum.\\n\\nare 5th graders 11 year-olds? are you using the wedo software or scratch?\\n\\ni teach classes at a local museum using picoblocks along with the wedo. picoblocks is a version of scratch written specifically to interface the wedo system along with the picocricket system. i have done both single day/ 3 hour classes and week long/ 4hour per day classes. so i have not established any set curriculum, especially that would apply to a long term class session however i would be happy to provide any help if desired. zac_ray@fastmail.fm i also have a scratch projects gallery, some of which i have used in my classroom here.\\n\\nhello, i realize this is an older thread, but maybe folks will see it. using the wedo with scratch 1.4 i have been very impressed with the control of the motors. works quickly and well. however, the distance and tilt sensors are just awful. i\\'ve purchased a second one of each just to make sure i didn\\'t have a dud, and they are both just as bad. has anyone had better luck with controlling this using scratch?\\n\\nwhen i first started experimenting with wedo, i found the tilt sensor pretty unsatisfying. i was expecting something more like an accelerometer. :) i adjusted my expectations -- so i\\'m more realistic about what i think i\\'m able to build with it. the distance sensor has been fine for me. (or, at least, been enough for what i\\'ve been trying to build.) what sorts of things are you trying to do with the distance and tilt sensors that make them less-than-optimal?\\n\\nhey karen, for example, the distance sensor at 11cm from a wall might read \"20\". at 12 cm from the wall it read \"2\". at 15cm from the wall it reads \"74\". the tilt sensor seems about as accurate. project example, just putting the tilt sensor on a large lego block. when it is tilted in direction \"1\" a sound would play. direction \"2\" would play a different sound. etc. idea was to make an instrument and then build on that. trouble is that the direction the sensor is tilted seems to have no relation to its numerical output. even in slow motion. kids lost interest, which in my book gives lego an f for these sensors. i\\'m sorry if i sound like i\\'m whining. the motor control in scratch is wonderful. but so far i have found the tilt and distance sensors to be very disappointing.\\n\\ni don\\'t think you\\'re whining. :) thanks for the examples. i agree that it\\'s frustrating if kids are losing interest!\\n\\n[slightly off-topic] i am going to start my ii edition of lego nxt courses for kids aged 10-13; i plan to use scratch logo-like capabilities to better introduce kids to programming and understand robot movements; are you aware of something similar in the pool ? thank you\\n\\ni know some teachers who use scratch as a precursor to mindstorms -- but nothing formally documented, as far as i know. is that what you meant?\\n\\n\"precursor\" is a term which describes well what i have in mind; is there any way to get in touch with those teachers, or to know what they are doing ? ps: if my post has a focus too narrow, just tell me\\n\\nnope -- not too narrow! i\\'ll send an email to some of the teachers and see if they\\'ll post something here.\\n\\ni used scratch when i taught robotics with lego mindstorm. i had my students create their prototype in scratch.\\n\\nthank you; i\\'d like to know what you mean by prototype (maybe you point to the programming side of the robotics activity ?)\\n\\nmy students drew their robots in scratch, and then had the sprite do the actions that they intended their actual robots to do.\\n\\nhello -- we just purchased two wedo sets this week. as steve noted (jan 2010), we also found thatthe motor seems to work very well but the two sensors are disappointing. does anyone know if it\\'sa scratch issue or a wedoissue? would like to hear more about wedo experiences on this forum! cheers, dennis\\n\\ni\\'m curious - are the problems only when used with scratch or also with the wedo software?\\n\\ni\\'ve been using wedo, with the activity pack, as the main part of a middle-school robotics elective. (http://www.elginisd.net/webpages/friedag/legorobotics.cfm?subpage=1322098) if kids advance through all the projects quickly and successfully enough, i usually let them \"graduate\" to the nxt kits. but i\\'ve also been introducing some kids to the scratch-with-wedo option, and it\\'s equally engaging, especially when they are also given the wedo extension sets (with additional building ideas). last year, for a local mini maker faire, i challenged my robotics club (http://www.elginisd.net/webpages/friedag/elginbricks.cfm) to build \"circus rides\" (inspired by the ferris wheel project in the extension set), while programming with scratch. they got very creative, using the scratch on-screen interface to add music, visual effects, and \"customer\" interactions, and using the wedo sensors to control the speed of the rides and/or visual effects, or to count out rotations as a method of timing the ride duration. if i had time to work on an \"open\" (free) scratch-plus-wedo curriculum, i\\'d start by mimicing/adapting the lego education wedo activity pack, and also adapt/borrow ideas from http://www.wedobots.com/ and http://www.damienkee.com/lego-wedo-coral-reef/. the main work needed would be coming up with all the sample programs, including the block-by-block explanations. but note also that lego education did a good setting up a kid-stimulating storyline (with videos & graphics) for each of the activity pack projects. i think that this kind of thematic play is a key part of lego\\'s concept of the wedo system, and i think it would be key to making any wedo+scratch initiative into a \"hit\".\\n\\n', '14078': \"what kind of application do you suggest that iuse to help students (new to scratch) to help plan their inquiry?\\n\\nhi brenda, if you haven't already, you might be interested in checking out the scratch curriculum guide. the guide includes handouts for planning and storyboarding scratch projects (see session #13 and handouts on page 68-69). hope that helps! m\\n\\n\", '49394': \"in this project, if you manually click in the script editor, the blocks run fine, but as soon as you try to activate the script with an event when clicked - with a letter or arrow key, the script doesn't run... ideas please??? here is the project:https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/153871202/\\n\\n\", '20444': 'hi. just wondering what the status is for this tool. i seem to remember it wss scheduled for relaese sometime this summer?\\n\\nam interested in the answer to this also. i was hoping it would be released by the start of this school year.\\n\\nschool starts next week. any news on the classroom management tool? marty\\n\\ni just received an update. development is progressing more slowly than anticipated.

or do you have 30 emails?\\n\\ni, too, would really love to use this. -jonathan\\n\\nhi, i\\'m new to scratch but really want to use it next week (hour of code activity) with my middle school tech classes. i\\'ve looked on both the scratch site and the scratched site for a classroom management interface and directions for use, but haven\\'t found anything. is this still not oprerational?\\n\\nuntil the classroom management is available, using either the offline editor or the scratch website, just get your pupils to save to their documents folder. we have been doing this since july and have had no problems. however, i know that when the classroom management is available, it will allow for sharing, remixing and commenting for the students and setting activities and tracking progress for teachers, which i am looking forward.\\n\\nany updates on this?\\n\\nyes, whatever happened to this? marty\\n\\ni would be very interested in knowing about (and testing) this tool :) any news about the timeline?\\n\\nhi all, the mit scratch team has informed us that they are planning to release educator accounts later this spring. we will share more details as soon as we know. sincerely, michelle chung, on behalf of the scratched team\\n\\ni made a gallery for each class and have them log-on and save their work under a shared account. i change the password after each class.\\n\\nwhere can i find a description of the features of the class management tool?\\n\\nthis does seem like a dilemma. most online email services require a child to be 13 to get an account. this is probablydue to concerns over the children\\'s online privacy protection act of 1998 (coppa). parents don\\'t have very many good options for getting kids email below age 13 unless they own their own website and control the ability to create email accounts. i am preparing for an online scratch class that will be delivered through a webinar primarily directed at homeschool kids, but open to anyone. i had the same concerns with getting kids access to scratch 2.0 as well.my solution is to use standalone version of scratch (1.4). the parents can download scratch 1.4 for the kids. there is no need for an email address for the kids.\\n\\nthat\\'s great news, michele. i hope that the educator accounts don\\'t require the students to have email accounts. marty\\n\\nin talking to scratch educators working with younger children, i\\'ve heard a few different strategies for setting up scratch accounts: have students use a teacher\\'s email to create their accounts -- this approach is often even preferred by teachers since notifications of innapropriate behavior on the scratch website will be sent to the email on file for the account. set up a class email account -- teachers can create a free class email account using gmail and have all the students input that email when signing up. get a parent/guardian to provide an email address -- this can be done by sending a note home about scratch with the student. as you mentioned, using the downloadable version of scratch is another option. i think it all depends on your situation and needs.\\n\\nstill waiting and eagerly anticipating this. i still hope for the following: 1. classroom management implies identification/authorization. the only way this is possible without the teachers becoming manual admins for this (which should not be their role), is to use a login from the school. my suggestiomn would be to allow google-ids, it will also eliminate problems with age for private accounts. it will also give the freedom to still use private accounts for those that have no school-systems. 2. preferably storage will be shared in an easily accessible way.\\n\\nhow about quest based learning?\\n\\nhi michelle, has there been any update with regard to the classroom management system for scratch? rose\\n\\ni would love to see a teacher dashboard similar to what common sense media has done with digital passport. it was so easy to get my young students to access! please let us know what\\'s the progress. thank you!\\n\\nso very important for this to happen. there are so many examples of efficient student managment systems (slo)out there so many websites we use with our students. i know: all in good time ---but sooner would be so much better! i am having my students set up accounts using my email address and all was working well until today. the last 5 would not go through to my email. i am hoping they eventually come through but until then they cannot share projects with me. really slows things down. . when i have the ablity to use a database and log in all my students in the site as prep, i save so much precious time. keep us posted.\\n\\ni\\'ve supported scratch in elementary school classrooms for a number of years, and have always been uncomfortable with young children using email for accounts in an open network. since i couldn\\'t find a good solution for this, a few of my friends decided to make one. class locker is a cloud-based class management tool for k-5 which lets students store and share a wide range of files, including the .sb and .sb2 formats used by scratch. while this does require an extra step for students to download from the scratch editor then upload to class locker, it offers a number of benefits: class locker \"student cubbies\" are provisioned by the teacher without the need for student emails. no need to create scratch accounts for students. walled garden controlled by teacher so students don\\'t get random posts from people outside the classroom. scratch projects can be included within a central student portfolio rather than a scratch-specific silo. parents can \"subscribe\" to all of their child\\'s projects in one step, and receive project updates by email. if you\\'d like to take a spin for your classroom, visit classlockers.com and click teacher, then teacher registration to sign up. use the promo code scratched to enable scratch files. let us know what you think. we\\'ll do our best to make it easy for you to integrate scratch into the classroom.\\n\\nhi jack, would you be willing to create a screencast to show us how to set up a class locker, and then also how to use it from the student\\'s perspective in scratch? paule\\n\\nhi paule, certainly! here are 2 videos to show how this works. student -http://youtu.be/bldvgovqyv8 teacher -http://youtu.be/jxy3fwr1hsg cheers, jack\\n\\njack, i\\'m thrilled about class locker! i am setting up classes and adding my students right now! do you recommend setting up a test locker for yourself (or adding yourself to a class) to see how it works as a student? i haven\\'t watched the videos yet, but i will. it is very easy to set up classes and add students. since i have very small classes, i just added their names but i like having the option to upload a csv file. i also like the simple look and feel of the interface. good job! i\\'m looking forward to using it with my students and scratch! marty h\\n\\njack, the sound doesn\\'t seem to be working on the videos. marty h\\n\\nalthough i wish jack all the best, i\\'d prefer a solution that plugs into the most common clouds in education.\\n\\nglad you like it. yes, you can add yourself as a student, then delete your profile later. for a quick taste of what students can see, check outclasslockers.com/demo/with the password \"scratched\"\\n\\ngood point, joost. which education clouds do you suggest we plug into? class locker started with an \"open cubby\" metaphor so k-2 students in the us could easily upload files from ipads without logins or passwords. we added individual passwords and google docs support after requests from 5th-6th grade teachers, and are now working on centralized authentication support for schools who have it.\\n\\nhi i would also be really keen to get a some kind of class manager option. i have different classes using scratch and despite my best efforts they have problems remembering their accounts and passwords, which makes it hard to save, share and remix as i\\'d like them to. would be great to be able to have a list of your student accounts and ability to reset passwords. thanks\\n\\nhi jack, since i am not us-based i\\'d find your solution hard to sell. i like the integration you have apparently realized already. personally, i think the burden of having to remember extra accounts (specfically for one puppose, like scratch) is bound to be frought with problems. scratch itself should allow integration with accounts that schools already have (this would also eliminate 13+ problems). ideally group-management would be supported too. google-apps integration would be great, but a moodle-plugin could do the trick too, perhaps? personally, i\\'d go for google in a flash.\\n\\ni would like to see google apps connection as well. my class sign up individually using my email address as the guardian. they use their google usernames and passwords already but it would certainly be easier in the future for students to join using their google apps accounts.\\n\\nhi all firstly, apologies if this has all been asked before but as a school we are new to scratch and are learning along with our students. i would like to create logins for our pupils who will be using scratch, 360 in total. can anyone out there let me know the easiest way of doing this please? the children are all very excited about using scratch and i don\\'t want to let them down. thank you\\n\\nhi linda, we have a great tool for scratch for teachers; itch has all the classroom management features teachers have been asking us for; we combined scratch together with a complete learning management system so you can do pretty much everything that folks on this list that folks have been asking for (and it\\'s available now :-). http://itchcode.com/ jason\\n\\n', '5803': 'i currently use scratch but i would want some to tell me the script to use to avoid my sprite flipping upside down when at edge of screen when i use \"if on edge, bounce script?

best reagrds, ed baafi founder: modkit\\n\\n', '4248': \"greetings everyone. i manage moderation on the scratch website. we've run into a few problems having to do with schools using a single ip address, so i thought i'd post about them here. if anyone has thoughts or ideas for solutions, we'd love to hear them! as with all websites that allows sharing of user generated content, the scratch website has to have a means of blocking sources of disrespectful or otherwise inappropriate material. we can do this by blocking accounts, but of course it's very easy to make a new one. in cases where users make multiple accounts to troll or post disrespectful content (usually mean or unconstructive comments), we resort to blocking access from the offending account's network or ipaddress. in many cases this works well - the source is blocked, and the user is invited to send us an email to discuss the situation and ask to be unblocked. however, when the source of the inappropriate comments or content is a student from a school that uses a single external ipaddress, we are often forced to block many more users than we would like to. often schools use a single external ip address through which all requests to and from the internet are funneled. this means that if we are forced to block access from this ipaddress, the entire school gets blocked. when entire school districts share a single ip address, the situation is even worse. we end up having to block an entire school district's access because one student on one computer in one classroom was acting inappropriately. unfortunately, it's hard to find a good solution to this problem from our end. the centralized architecture of a school or schools sharing a single ipaddress leaves us with no alternative but to block the access of many classrooms to prevent access from a single user. if you have any ideas about ways to better address this issue, we'd love to hear them! if this issue has affected your school in the past, perhaps you can send a link to this post to your itspecialists, so they can consider this scenario.\\n\\nhey amos, sounds like a head scratcher. first of all, assuming you have easy access to your ip logs, you can continue to block ip addresses that are only utilized by a single user. it's not an ideal solution to begin with but it's not out of the question.in the event that a problem user is utilizing an ip address shared among many scratch members, you might consider waiting to inform the user that their account has been suspended until they attempt to login. at that point you can set a cookie on the machine that, when present, prevents the registration of new accounts and/or the use of existing accounts from that specific machine. this could be a traditional browser cookie or an adobe flash based cookie. a flash cookie is going to be browser agnostic and a little more difficult to delete, if only because a lot of users don't know about them, but obviously requires the flash plugin to be installed. it's not a bullet proof solution and it might prevent subsequent students on the same machine from being able to use scratch until the cookie is deleted or expired but it's better than blocking an entire school and it might be enough to deter or stem repeated abuse.\\n\\nthanks for the ideas, greg!adding a cookie might be a good way of at least temporarily disabling access from a single computer - as long as the user doesn't know how to clear their cache. we may have to consider that for the future.\\n\\nif you note the time of the offence, you might get the school district to look in their logsif they have themto see what computer was used and track down the student. or perhaps you could enable a mode for troublesome ips where all contributions have to be moderated.\\n\\nhi dave - that's a good idea. perhaps we could include the timestamp of the inappropriate comments in the message that is displayed when acccess is blocked.if the teacher who sees this information can connect with the itperson who has the logs, they might be able to locate the computer that was used to make the comments. changing a school to 'highly moderated' mode or some kind of probationary status might help solve the problem as well. unfortunately, this would be a very energy intensive process. we've considered the possibility of giving teachers a different status on the website, and ccing reports of inappropriate content by associatied student accounts to them. but teachers are often quite busy!so we're not sure if that would be a good solution.\\n\\nbumping this post as i would like to ask if there has been any development on this? i am the sysadmin in a school that shares an ip with the rest of our county's schools, so we're a prime example of the situation the op gave. we have been advised that there has been some form of non-guidline-compliant content from our ip. this only happens when i set up a user account (any way to set these up in bulk and manage them in one place, by the way?). i'm concerned that we're going to get blocked as we have other schools on the same ip address and i have no control what they do. any thoughts?\\n\\nthere a ton of great ideas and resources on this post: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/216542/how-do-i-uniquely-identify-computers-visiting-my-web-site\\n\\n\", '12805': \"the weekly roundup is where the scratched team shares some of the major -- as well as some of the overlooked -- news, stories, and events related to scratch that took place throughout the week. scratched weekly roundup 05/12/12 - 05/18/12 happyscratch day!

for personal expression or for problem solving -- is something that everybody should be able to do. we hope that you will be able to join us for the creative computing symposium on saturday, july 13 at the harvard graduate school of education. the day-long symposium is an opportunity to connect with other educators and support each others' learning about creative computing with scratch. the symposium also serves as a capstone event for the creative computing online workshop (ccow), which began on june 3 and ends on july 12. more than 1,900 educators from around the world are participating in the workshop, which involves hands-on scratch activities, interactions with other educators, and reflections on practice. participation in the online workshop is not required to attend the symposium, but symposium attendees will benefit from having some basic familiarity with scratch (for example, by completing the week 1 activities of ccow). the symposium is something between a conference and a party -- in the spirit of participatory professional development activities like edcamp and scratched meetups, the symposium is an opportunity to connect with colleagues and to deepen your learning. the day begins and ends with formal remarks, but the bulk of the day is segmented into several self-organized breakout sessions. at the beginning of the day, we'll decide on the topics that we would like to explore and then break into groups to pursue the learning that we're most excited about. want to spend more time hands-on with scratch? propose or join a group of builders. want to make plans and get feedback on a scratch club? find like-minded colleagues for a discussion. this day is about you and your learning. more information and registration is available

over in a short eyeblink... ;-) but if you draw a colored thick line in the background (stage) then you can change gravity to positive 0.981(experiment with other values) when the sprite touches the colored line. and it kind of bounces... --------------------------------------------- when green flag is clicked [go to x:0 y:180] (go to starting point) [set gravity to -0.981] (set the value of the variable) [forever (loop) [change y by gravity] (the sprite moves down ) if touching color (if you have drawn a colored line) [change gravity by 0.981] (this increases the gravity and the sprite is moving up) else [change gravity by -0.981] (this decreases the gravity variable and the speed down doubles) end forever] -------------------------------------------------- probably are there many

attendees: steven connelly janet dee ingrid gustafson nicole hart bobbi kezirian lorraine leo natalie paine ivan rudnicki adam scharfenberger rosemary slattery richard smyth daniel watt recap: part 1: networking and scheduling: after an informal gathering around our food table with coffee, juice, fruit, blueberry cake and smartfood (delicious anytime!), we introduced ourselves and shared one challenge that we had coming up in the near future around scratch. ivan offered his challenge to integrate scratch into a k-8 curriculum at three boston charter schools and nicole shared her challenge to use scratch in ninth grade math class learning linear equations. for our first session, we decided to form groups around these two very different topics. part 2: collaborating and generating ideas in the k-8 curriculum discussion, we brainstormed teacher pd strategies, inquiry learning strategies and workflow for elementary students. for pd, the group recommended providing strategies for cooperative learning such as ask 3 and then ask me, pair programming, assigning roles to students in team projects, and gallery walks. we also talked about the need to implement grade level appropriate computational literacies which can be found in the national csta standards. other resources that were suggested were: scratched website, creative computing curriculum, and ccow (for pd ideas). in the learning linear equations group, they brainstormed general math applications for scratch with the intent to find a way to incorporate linear equations. nicole had a specific idea which was to use the scenario of lebron james dunking a basketball. part 3: our mini hackathon for the second session both groups took on the challenge of creating a scratch project with a basketball theme to demonstrate linear equations. janet added the challenge to use pair programming as an experience. five teams accepted the challenge and worked for 45 minutes. during lunch every team shared their solutions. here are two solutions that were shared on scratch: simple slope and intercept: http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/51239584/ slope-2: http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/51238036/ everyone agreed that the simple slope and intercept project with one sprite and 7 lines of code would be great for nicoles lesson (although it still needs lebron and a hoop). dan also shared an example of a simple function machine in scratch that requires the player to guess the function based on the inputs and outputs. our next meetup is scheduled for saturday, april 4, 2015. we want this to be a big reunion

competing social networking platforms, ever-shifting working styles, novel job descriptions displacing the old, manifold curricular and performance demands. with all these possibilities vying for our buy-in, it is vital to seek commonalities. it is at the intersections that we will begin to make sense and make use of a media revolution well underway and yet incompletely understood by our educational infrastructure. this conference will highlight the role of media literacy educators capacity to take a leading role in this nationwide task. media-savvy educators now have the chance to articulate how new pedagogies can erect road signs at the intersections where communication practices, platforms, and cultures cross paths. disciplines of thought and method can merge to form innovative perspectives, refreshing the way we approach problems and generating paths of study relevant to 21st century careers, citizens, relationships and lifestyles. the 2013 namle conference will

mind is this project, wherein students in spain and india learned about the refugee crisis and created scratch sprites and backdrops for others to remix as they, too, learn about the crisis. we'd love to learn more about games for social issues, so we'll gladly tweet about this and ask the community to add links to a doc, which we can then make into a resource on scratched. in the meantime, can you share a little more about what you're looking for? any specific social issues, for example? also, though not an example game, this piece, by ricarose references many civically-engaged projects and the ways in which young people make meaning and explore big ideas and problems through scratch. thanks for the inspiration! willa, on behalf of the scratched team\\n\\n\", '18096': 'are there any 2.0

i will be teaching game design. i noticed in the curriculum it suggests the usage of a notebook for students. was wondering how others have used the notebook as part of the curriculum? i know in the old days, i used to do flowcharts but, something tells me that there is more efficient use of notebooks than flowcharts. i also know, that my students had problems with forever and if then blocks as

i have discovered the scratch.ini file can be used to define the proxy server and port on ms windows computers. does any one know the syntax for defining the proxy username and password? we are also tring to identify the equivalent configuration file for scratch in both the sugar and gnome versions for use with the olpc xo laptops. hoping someone has already solved this challenge. cheers ian\\n\\nhi, ian. this page has some information about the proxy settings: http://info.scratch.mit.edu/network_installation i believe the proxy mechanism should work on all platforms, not just windows. for the xo, the configuration file is scratch.ini in the scratch folder. i think that works in gnome as well as sugar, but i haven't tested it. note: if you use the linux version of scratchinstead of the xo version, then the configuration file is.scratch.ini in the user's home folder. but i recommend using the xo version of scratch on the xo, even under gnome. -- john\\n\\nhi john, i have not been able to find any ini/conf files for scratch in the sugar environment. a search of the /home/olpc/activities/scratch.activity/ and sub directories did not yield any results. i installed scratch-1.4.0.1-1.i386 as super user and the scratch.ini file resides in /usr/lib/scratch/directory. the proxyserver= and proxyport= lines in the scratch.ini file (http://info.scratch.mit.edu/network_installation) work when the proxy server does not require a username and password. however, the scratch upload fails when a proxy server authentication is required. my instinct tells me that there are a couple of additional lines required in the scratch.ini file  which define the username and password for proxy authentication. cheers ian\\n\\nhi, ian. unfortunately, scratch does not support proxies that require authentication. perhaps you can convince your it folks to run a proxy server that does not requireauthentication... on the xo, even if there is not already a scratch.ini file in the scratch.activity folder, you can create one with a text editor add the proxy lines. make sure that the file is readable by world so the scratch activity can read it. on fedora, i'm pretty sure scratch ignores the scratch.ini file in /usr/lib/scratch (which probably shouldn't have been included) and uses the file .scratch.ini in the user's home folder instead. you can test this by switching languages, then verifying that ~/.scratch.ini was created. (scratch records the language setting in that file.) hope that helps... -- john\\n\\nmany thanks john for your support. cheers ian\\n\\n\", '9436': \"just finished my second year working with my scratch unit in moodle. our session this year ran a full nine weeks. i had some pretty good projects and a lot of ... well, unfinished projects, (lack of completion of work in all subjects seems to be school-wide, so i wouldn't blame scratch). because of scratch and moodle abilities to enable students to work together, i had my first cooperative project that two boys were able to complete despite being in two different classes. i posted what i thought were our best projects on my class pages. as i have emptied all student data/work out of my class, i have created a user that members of scratched can use to log on and look at the course. my course is not perfect, it needs updating and reconfiguring, changes i made this year helped the flow of the course, but i know i can do better. it is also structured for a course that can be posted on our blackboard portal, (all schools in nm have access to a blackboard portal), hopefully i can put it on blackboard next year, (i love moodle, but i would rather teach than maintain a server when i don't have to). moodle site: http://www.chaparralmiddle.us/moodle/login/index.php id: tempuser password: tempuser1 i am open to any suggestions for improving the unit. i tried to have students work on understanding and creating algorithms and reading/following directions, (working more independently). carl, (aka desert_rat)\\n\\n\", '13302': \"i'll be arriving wednesday afternoon with my 7 high school students. we'd love to connect with anyone else staying in the dorms.. possibly for a light supper or ice cream wednesday evening?\\n\\nwanna hear about camera action workshop?

mary adelaide\\n\\nhi! i\\'m currently collaborating with universidad de valladolid, spain. we have two projects that use maths and scratch: we developed \"match: programando matemticas con scratch\" (match: coding maths with scratch), a research project in which we developed four guides to encourage different mathematical concepts on children 9-10 years (5th primary here in spain; usa\\'s grade 4). concepts like angles, times, basic aritmetic operations,polygons, others). we have already tested those guides in different classrooms. we also have two extracurricular workshops, running in the cities of valladolid and segovia, called cjp (club de jvenes programadores; young programmers club), in which weekly (2 or 3 hours each week) over 50 children (ages 7-15) develop their own projects in scratch. they use a lot mathematics on them (although i think they are not aware of it :d); some are published on a studio we have on scratch.mit.edu. two great examples are the bottle flip challenge and an economy game they are developing right now. i hope this can help :) thanks!

when i was in computer science in the 80\\'s, it seemed to thatthe mix was about sixty/forty. some of the most brilliant technology people i have worked with over the last twenty some odd years have been women. i know this is not a problem we will solve here but this problem is depriving the field of technology with a much needed perspective.\\n\\nvery few females choose cs classes voluntarely, and like you mentioned it was not always this way. people always say we need more \"female-oriented\" or \"female-friendly\" examples in our cs1 courses, but i hardly ever see concrete examples. i once read (and the reference escapes me right now) that giving a context in which cs can help solve/address/increase awareness of social and environmental causes may entice more females into the technology field. i think one of the examples given was http://www.darfurisdying.com/ , among others.\\n\\ni think that at age of 12 years students already have build their opinion about cs. girls think that cs is for boys, any boys thinks that it is for geeks. teachers have to find better ways to motivate girls for cs. one good aproach is story-oriented teaching described by caitlin kelleher, creator of storytelling alice. you can read some of her papers on http://www.alice.org/kelleher/storytelling/index.html. you can find also many other sources that describes problem of women in it: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/women,_girls_and_information_technology http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/women_in_computing\\n\\nbased on personal observation, ithink that 7 years old :-) is more of the transition point where you can either introduce technology as a creative and interesting endeavor, or something you go to a big box retail store and purchase/window-shop every sunday. create or buy? brain or bucks? as more cool/uncool marketing is pushed down to younger and younger girls to sell dolls, clothers and accessories, etc. (i mean, where was the store \"justice\" 15 years ago?) the new \"normal\" is to be less curious and succumb to peer pressure (or whatever is on tv/cable/internet). iwill not be surprised if a new study comes out showing the proportion of 6-9 yo girls playing with legos dropped from 15-20 years ago versus today. as everyone on this board attests, scratch is wonderful because it can capture the imaginations of the younger set and is gender neutral -- you can work on whatever you can imagine! another positive development isee is the relatively recent offering of leg wedo kits www.media.mit.edu/sponsorship/getting-value/collaborations/wedo which unlike the lego mindstorms product line, comes in very bright colors and is appealing to the younger set regardless of gender. nice that it was developed by the mitcrew, and works with scratch! :-) the kids will take to these if the adults let them, offer it to them, make it available. *** link to aauw advocay group paper \"why so few?

(this can be found here:https://vimeo.com/65583694 ?) ?2) showed thema very short powerpoint (2 slides)with a few common coding and scratch terms. ihad students from many backgrounds and skill levels, so i just wanted to make sure we all knew what \"coding\" meant, and what a\"script\" was, etc. there were only 5 termsin the entire powerpoint. ?3) then we went to scratch online and played around withsome of theshared projects, just so they could see what other people were doing. (we only did this for about 5-7 minutes). ?4) ihad them open a blank project and did a quick overview of all the different parts of scratch (scrpit area, stage, sprites, etc...), which i figured wasa good idea since most of the kids had never tried scratch before. ?5) we then launched in to creating a small game that i had chosen in advance. the game was star hunter ?from one of the scratch books i was using at the time. the title escapes me at the moment, as i was working with about 4 different books. ?6) then, at the end of the class, i had a whole packet of materials for them to take home: scratch cards, some free scratch stickers that i got at a library conference, anew game for them to try, an info sheet for parents, a scratch book list, and a small vocabulary list to help them understand some of the coding terms they would encounter. ?i had problems. phew! as you can imagine, this was a lot to cram into an hour, andwe ended up running about an hour and fifteen minutes. this kind of irked some of the parents who were waiting outside ofour computer lab to pick up their kids, so i need to trim some of the fat and smooth out some of the \"wrinkles\". here are the problems i encountered: ?- as i mentioned in the subject line, theclass is for ages 8 to 12. i had a really hard time getting this age group to follow what i was doing. they wanted to branch off on thier own right away and some of them made quite a mess of the program we were trying to make. i had to fix these kids\\' code before we could move on, taking up precious time. ?- they were just not interested in any of the preliminary stuff that i did (#\\'s 1-4 above). they all sat there, deadpan, looking at me like i had 2 heads. maybe this is normal for that age group?should i just scratch those parts completely? maybe just the video? shoud i assume these kids are learning these terms at school? arrrgh!! ?- i thought i had chosen a really cool game for them to make. i was corrected right away (kids are honest like that, eh?). the game took too long to make, they didn\\'t want to be locked into the sprites and backgrounds that i pre-chose to save time, and some of them didn\\'t even bother to try and make the game i selected. i eventually just let thosekids create and explore on thier own with the understanding that if they needed my help it would have to be after the class. ?- being a library, our publiccomputers do not have external speakers.public users can bring headphones to use, and we have headphones for our adult computer classes,but iwas not going to give the 8 - 12 year olds headphones because i figured they would never pay attention to me that way!the kids were all very disappointed that they could add sounds to their project but notnear what they sound like. i had a set of speakers that i attached to the admin computer so i could play them examples of the sounds, but this was not fulfilling for them. i don\\'t know what i\\'m going to do about this. even if i could scare up 12 sets of speakers for the class, i can only imagine the noise this would create. ?- they were not really interested in the packets i made so i felt like i failed to pique their interest. i know that we are a digital society now, and kids especially so, so maybe they are just not used to getting information this way.most of the information i put in the take home packets is available online, anyway, so i will probably just skip this next time. most of the online help i have found so far is for an entire 10-12 week scratch curriculum. i do not need this much material. any suggestions? has anyone else taught a short introductory class like this? ?my thoughts are to cut out the vocab. power point and the scratch overview (i would just explain as we went) and to then just have a ton of ideas to get the kids started on whatever they feel like making. i could have scratch cards and print off some small projects for the kids to try (if they want), and then just sort of float the room and help them individually. last time, this is what i ended up doing for most of the class anyway. i think more freedom to create might be a better idea than trying to drag them all through a lengthy peice of scratch code. thoughts on this plan? ?thank you so very much if you have made it this far. this is a long shot cry for help (lol), and i am sure that i will figure out something for them to do... but i thought if someone with more experience could weigh-in that it might help me.\\n\\namy, i hope you get responses to your question. i\\'m trying to do a similar program at a local library using the 7 session scratch creative coding curriculum. thanks, ~nate\\n\\ni hope so, too nate! ?i have pretty much decided against trying to drag them all through another whole set of specificgame code. in my experience,they get distracted, don\\'t listen because they\\'re too busy trying out their own ideas, and you end up having to stop the class, fix and/or delete everything they\\'re trying to add to the code, and then back up two or three steps because they didn\\'t catch what you were talking about while they were making ten different colored sprites. lol. ?i am strongly leaning toward more creative freedom for the class, but i am not really sure how to implement such a plan without resulting in pure chaos. an hour is probably not enough time to help 10 or 12 students with individual projects. add to that the fact that we are not creating individual accounts for these kids (we are leaving that up to the parents if the kids want to pursue scratch after the class) so theycan\\'t save any of their work. if they want to continue working on their projects this is going to be a problem! ?i will post my final lesson plan on here, whether i get any responses or not! amy\\n\\nhi amy, when i write my activities, i\\'ve find that kids that age tended to zone out if we didn\\'t get straight into \\'doing things\\', at least for the first lesson. something i\\'ve noticed about the activities in books, is that they seem more aimed at kids sitting at home, in a one-on-one setting, with more than an hour to read through. for your 1) rather than showing them a video, it could be just as easy to get them to actually make their own example. it keeps everyone engaged, and you can see those that get stuck straight away, and help them get their code working too. for this, you\\'d just want to have your screen up on a projector, and then have everyone follow along. it doesn\\'t have to be really involved, just a simple loop. the one i\\'ve seen done well, is hooking in sound or visual input into movement of a sprite: look under \\'sensing\\' for \\'loudness\\' or \\'video\\' blocks. that will give them an fairly instant gratification. for those that it works, suggest a challenge e.g. changing sprites, or altering the code to see what happens, and while they\\'re engaged with that, you can help others fix their code. at this point, there\\'s not going to be a ton of debugging, but getting everyone\\'s example working is really important so that they feel some achievement. with debugging though, just make sure you vocalise what you\\'re doing, to keep kids engaged. the first time they jump ahead of you and say something like \"oh, i had the wrong value there\" is a huge step. seeing as you don\\'t have speakers and possibly not microphones and cameras available, what about starting with replicating a single scratch card for them to follow along with? they can group together to make a full game or project, and that would allow kids to grab one that they need for an idea. for instance, there\\'s the scratch card that shows how to make a piece of clothing snap into the right position when dragged to a sprite. something else that worked for us was to have a handout for kids to have a scratch account before coming to the first 1 hour session. this meant that some had already had a play, but that they could also save their progress. in this day of tablets and mobile devices, kids relate this to when they can save game progress, and i\\'ve found it can be harder to get them motivated the next time, when they realise they have to re-create their project again. they\\'ll also have something to \\'take home\\' and show off, but also to build on later. one activity that has worked really well for my classes, is to show the kids how to do faux gravity, for a very very simple platform game. once they have a character that they can move with keys and will sit on top of a \\'level\\' they\\'ll essentially be able to create their own game. we sometimes have done this, and then get the kids to go and play each other\\'s games. with this, one thing to watch for, is that it\\'s easy to have too ambitious a game idea, and then kids become frustrated when they realise how much code is needed. a good way to have a set scope, is just get the kids to draw a square on a piece of paper, put in some stick figures, and have a basic idea drawn out visually. that way, there\\'s a defined scope for their first milestone i.e. reproducing their design in scratch. tell them to keep it real simple, as they can add extras once it is working. the important thing is that it works first. then make sure you already have the extra features in your back pocket, so to speak. e.g. before the class, sit down and work out easy ways to do features such as score, change a one-player game to a two-player game (copy the first sprite and its code, then modify the code for the second player controls), or changing the game to make it multi level (change the background and player location when a goal sprite is collided with). to summarize: - do the activities yourself so that you know any gotchas beforehand (always helps to say, oh i ran into this one too) - try to get them making things straight away so they\\'re not bored - verbalize any troubleshooting you do so they see the thought process and stay involved - keep the activity simple - allow them a way to save their work so they can show it off and add to it later - set simple challenges, and have something up your sleeve for the more advanced kids (there\\'s always some) so you can help others troubleshoot this is my first reply so i\\'m trying to type fast enough that it wont time out :) hope this helps.. justaboutfine\\n\\njustaboutfine, ?thank you so much! i love the idea of having them set up accounts before the class! in fact, i already emailed our youth director and asked her to add this to the registration process. i felt really bad last time because they had to scrap thier whole game; i made one and posted it on scratch for those who wanted to add on to it later, but a lot of them hadcustomized their backdrops and sprites to make it more \"theirs\", and in that respect they would have had to redo some things. ?i like a lot of your ideas, actually! i wish that we had more classes soi cansee what the kids come up withon thier own. i did request that they bring their own, simple ideasin the class description, so hopefully i\\'ll have some that are ready to go with ideas so that i can help the ones that need it more. i wholly expect to have all different levels of experience. i will definately be using the scratch cards as you suggested. having them start with a simple idea and then build from there sounds much more productive then dragging them all through a game they are not really interested in. ?i will post my final curriculum (for one hour- lol)here, and also let everyone know how my(now second) attempt went! ?amy c.\\n\\n', '1323': \"we invite you to join us for a free workshop that will be taking place saturday, november 21 from 1-3pm at mit media lab. information below and at

block from the tools it mostly works; however, it generates turds for all local methods and data members of the specified remote object thatis accessed in the c-block area...(i also end up in a bad state over time and have to blow it all away and recreate the unused methods and data members to get everything working properly...here is an image of an example: the of block works fine if ionly have one sprite but fails if iam dependent upon a variable. and the automatic creation of all local methods and data members of the remote object which are specified in the c-section of \"tell object\" is a real pain...(a maintenance nightmare as well)...it is interesting to note that even though the local copies are created, the correct remote methods get identified and called at run-time....mostly.... is there an official way to deal with this? iam sure ican find a work around, but iwas hoping there was a silver bullet to solve this...\\n\\ni guess i should add that this problem only occurs because i am trying to encapsulate the code local to the respective objects (sprites) by creating local methods. if everything is global you will not see this issue. i can certainly create methods that use a naming convention like \\'sprite_method\\' which will help the user to call the method from the correct object, but that is really a poor solution. again the problem only exists when calling a local method of a remote object, where you use a variable to store the remote object reference... thanks, al\\n\\n', '11648': 'the 2012 creative computing reunion

chung mylo lam aaron morris recap despite a snowstorm, 27 educators gathered at mit for the reunion. after a speed networking activity and a huge welcome back from karen and mitch, the group launched into morning breakout sessions. four groups emerged: intro to scratch - during this session, led by mitch, those who were new to scratch or wanted a refresher course were able to gain hands-on experience building interactive collage in scratch. rubric review- a group of educatorsfrom suffern, ny are developing an assessment to accompany the scratch curriculum guide draft and they organized this session to receive feedback on their rubric. scratch/cs/java course connections - frank and stacy led this session to discuss how to make connections between the learning that their students are experiencing with scratch and java programming. scratch activity design - ron, michelle, and several other educators took this time to brainstorm activities and challenges that might help engage students who are stuck or are struggling to make personal connections with scratch. after lunch, we had the pleasure of hearing a wide variety of presentations during show & tell: frank discussed strategies for engaging both boys and girls in his class and shared some of the types of projects they created. jennifer talked about how she uses the scratch website during class with her 8th graders. eleanor started a discussion around creating electronic design journals. claire shared projects that were designed by her fourth graders while learning about lists and variables. ron shared his experiences working to engage students about the coordinate graph using scratch. anne marie presented games created by 7th and 8th graders during an enrichment course. ernest shared a sample scratch project that one of his students created during summer camp. david presented an assessment rubric that he and his colleagues are currently developing to complement their scratch curriculum unit. debbie showed a project she developed that creates melodies in scratch. julianne presented a draft project and requested feedback on behalf of one of her 5th grade students. ryan presented student projects that were designed to use lists. lorraine shared projects made by her k-6 studentsthat illustrate creating, communicating, and collaborating with scratch. after show & tell, we held two more breakout sessions, each lasting 30-minutes. during the first 30-minute period, sessions offered included: edc/mit instrument design - in this session, francisco and karen presented an assessment tool currently in development to evaluate the types of computational thinking skills that students develop while working with scratch. intro to curriculum guide - aaron and michelle invited educators to learn more about the scratch curriculum guide draft and share their experiences from using the guide. the second set of breakout sessions covered: scratch website - jennifer led a group discussion around what challenges and opportunities might arise from integrating the scratch website as part of the curriculum. connecting the physical world - mitch presented different tools that help make connections between scratch and the physical world such as the lego wedo robotics kit, picoboard, and xbox kinect. resources each participant received a scratch starter kit which includes a copy of the scratch curriculum guide, scratch cards, scratch cat stickers, a scratch pin and other resources. if you\\'d like to share feedback on the scratch curriculum guide draft, please share your

will they maybe even work online? i\\'d be happy about any information on this topic. thanks!\\n\\nhi, bernd. scratch 1.4 was built on top of the squeak programming system. squeak supports arbitrary length integers, so scratch took advantage of that feature. both the java-based online scratch player and the new flash-based one represent numbers interally as double precision floating point numbers (64-bit). so, unfortunately, the online version of scratch will no longer support infinite precision integers. of course, you can continue to use scratch 1.4 for projects that requireinfinite precision integers, but people will need to download your projects and play them with scratch 1.4 to get the correct results; online, they will get floating point approximations, which i realize may be useless in certain kinds of projects (e.g. projects involving large prime numbers such as public key cryptography). floats have 52-bits of mantissa, so if you stick to working with numbers up to 2^25 or so, you can get exact results. but i realize one would rather not have to think about such implementation details... -- john\\n\\nthanks for this feedback, john! it is a bit disappointing news, though. one thing i really liked about scratch is what you indicate in your last paragraph - one did not have to think about such precision issues, and i could make a nerdy project (scrip &

student in the lifelong kindergarten group for the past month. i have created a new resource for teaching scratch to kids ages 5-8. it is a series of activities and pointers for teaching scratch to young students. after these activities alone, the students will have enough tools to create their own stories. i work through the creation of a simple underwater scene to show how scratch can be made easy for kids in this age group. as an educator, you need only minimal experience in scratch to be able to use this resource. here is a link to my preliminary draft: new resource i would love some feedback! tell me what you think! thanks, crystal\\n\\nhi, much appreciated that you take the time to put that together and share it. i was contemplating how to get teachers and students started using scratch here (in afghanistan) and this is a really nice starting point for lessons. perhaps you should add this resource to oercommons / merlot etc? i was quite surprised to find that the oerrepos really don\\'t feature that many scratch resources compared to how many great already existing scratch projects there are to demonstrate in an interactive way many key curriculum concepts. lots of java applets.. not many scratch links. i would definitely like to use this as a starting point - perhaps we find something that people are going to be more familiar with here than fish as this is a landlocked place... let\\'s see... thanks! -mike\\n\\nthanks, crystal, this is very interesting, and i really like the setup! i\\'m currently targeting age group 10-12, but i would also like to work with smaller children in the future. here are my comments: - it would be good to roughly indicate in the resource how much time each exploration will take. - i like the opening activity a lot and i would definitely do it. - i think it\\'s good to defer the green flag to the challenging explorations. i think understanding the difference between preview mode and presentation mode is not easy, and working in preview mode only avoids this issue - exploration 1: when you say to the children \"let\\'s get the fish moving\", the natural reflex of many is to drag it around on the screen - task accomplished. how do you explain to them that this is not the point? i haven\\'t come up with a convincing answer to this yet. if you have an answer, it would be very good to put it into the resource. - exploration 1 again: i think \"move 10 steps\" can be explained easily, but how about \"turn 15 degrees\"? are you talking about the 15 at all, or do you use \"turn 15 degrees\" as a black box that just does some turning? it would be useful also here to have a hint for the teacher in the resource. - exploration 6: this seems a pretty tough one to me. in most programming languages, it is natural to do if-then-else before loops, but in scratch, that doesn\\'t apply. the \"forever\" block is arguably simpler than if-then, as there is no condition. even for ages 10-12, i\\'m starting with \"forever\". for example, you could make the fish move forever and combine it with \"bounce on edge\" to create a very simple yet natural animation of the fish swimming back and forth. also, i could imagine that the touching-color block together with if-then is over the heads of most 5-8 year old, but in order to really tell this, i don\\'t have enough experience. i\\'m planning to test it with my 7-year old daughter. - general: when teaching scratch, is it about scratch, or about programming concepts? my approach is to teach concepts, and i\\'m using scratch as an excellent tool to do it. i think that any resource should carefully reflect on what it is trying to teach. you are saying in the overview that \"students will have enough tools to create their own stories\", and that they can \"express themselves\". it\\'s clear to me what you mean, but if i wanted to be picky, i could say that they don\\'t need scratch for that. paper and crayons as in the opening activity would be completely sufficient. what you are really doing is teaching concepts that enable the students to express themselves in a programming language rather than the paper-crayon language. and you can name these concepts: (i) statement (makes the computer do something for you instead of doing it yourself); (ii) script/program (sequence of statements executed in top-down order) , and so on. i\\'m not suggesting that you rename \"motion: move and turn\" to something fancy involving the term statement, but i do suggest to add a paragraph for the teacher where you make the concepts taught in every exploration explicit. in exploration 1, it\\'s exactly (i) and (ii) above (snapping statements together to form a script). thanks again for sharing this resource! best, bernd.\\n\\nbernd, thank you for the detailed feedback! i found some of your questions very helpful while refining my resource. i hope i can help with your concern about \"getting the fish moving.\" when you are starting in scratch, make it clear that the goal is to make the computer do things for you. the goal is to make the computer do what you want. i think if you take on the challenge of teaching kids ages 5-8 that they are more than capable of grasping many difficult programming concepts. even those students that lack basic reading skills might surprise you with their skills and understanding in scratch. i hope that you find my soon to come revision of the resource helpful. good luck in your scratch endeavors! - crystal\\n\\nexcellent suggestions, these changes will help reach this age of students and their teachers.\\n\\nthis is a great resource crystal. it will be very well received by the teachers in my school. i introduced scratch in school as part of a child - led topic week during the first week back in january. like you the first consideration for me was the vocabulary that the children would use. amazing how quickly newly introduced terms become part of their retained vocabulary! as the children had never come across anything like this before, the first activity i did was to give them a sheet of printed out commands from each of the blocks (a bit like lego building blocks). in the hall we then acted out the role of the sprite (which was only allowed to follow the commands they were holding). all the group were familiar with paint and i didn\\'t need to tell them how to create sprites or stages, they just experimented. i think that is where their generation benefits... they have no fear of technology... unlike the teachers who currently know less than the pupils - so i will be distributing your resource in the hope they feel more confident working with it in class. i am hoping to get some students entering the schools computer animation awards(uk) i enjoy using scratch as a teaching tool. although i have not been using it for long i can quickly create animations and games targeted at bridging gaps in their learning.\\n\\nhi crystal this is terrific. i really like the way you have tried to incorporate language and vocabulary. i work with young children who have a hearing loss -- but we don\\'t use sign language and i teach them to listen and speak. they are usually learning language and i use scratch to help make language concepts clear, but also to help them recognize the representation of these language concepts in different ways. e.g. the use of \\'when\\', while and \"if..\" syntax in english. i am currently trying to match some of the scratch commands with english syntactical structures and examples. your project really is on that track and extremely useful for young children! hope you continue elaborating on the project. maybe examples of social studies and science material , associated language and how it can be taught using scratch. thanks again for your work!!\\n\\nfantastic! i agree with the comment about adding time markers. getting young kids engaged in scratch seems always to involve helping them to finish a short project quickly. maybe build in the notion of \"versions.\" so after a few steps, they finish and we congratulate them, but then we say, \"how about we go for version #2?\" that\\'s another element of the modern design process taught! thanks! -chris-\\n\\nhi there, the link to the pdf document is not working anymore. can i get it elsewhere? thanks in advance!\\n\\nyou can still get it at

to programming. i\\'m not seeing how to post documents to this forum so the following links may be of interest: 1) scratch / alice / greenfoot / java topics and a path through freely available tools: -https://files.me.com/javageek/c5sk7y (461kb pdf) 2) scratch to greenfoot - using a game as an example of programming concepts from scratch to java -https://files.me.com/javageek/pe88f7 (7mb pdf) i usually suggest that not all students will want to become programmers, any more than each person that likes to look at stars will want to become a professional telescope builder. we need people skilled in building telescopes and using telescopes, but a lot of people will simply want to enjoy the end result and the ability to peer into the universe at their fingertips. correspondingly, it\\'s important for students to understand how programming works and examples like scratch extended to byob (http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs10/sp11/) for cs principles (http://csprinciples.org) pilot courses as introduction to programming and computer science, those are good examples of scratch as a \"low floor\" entry point for the topics. i\\'m very interested in the problem solving skills and creativity it takes to go from a blank (scratch, alice, greenfoot, other...) project to a working game, simulation or story that\\'s fun and/or useful. there are programming and problem solving pieces

interested in cross-reality environments but we need to walk before we can run. we will be putting up a doodle in the next couple of weeks to garner interest - we already have a space marked out. iguess we are lucky in that the island this year has been underwritten by vital.ac.uk - an offshoot of the open university - they are sponsoring our activities for the year so it should be interesting. i will be posting all videos, interactions, machinima and text records through the http://www.vital.ac.uk site and include specific links here. leon\\n\\n\", '32494': 'hi scratch educators, i hope someone can give me some advice about a situation i\\'ve seen pop up often enough to worry me. i\\'ve had the conversation with my students often about giving credit for ideas they use online. i have one student that added a project to our class studio that is identical to a really popular featured program created by another user. the program is called \"neon ride\". the student of mine is claiming credit for it - that he made it under a different account a while ago, and moved it. there are some things going on in the comments of these programs that i\\'m not comfortable with, and i need to put a stop to it when i see the kids next week. my student\\'s project:http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/48612296/ the other, more popular project:http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/30133706/ in a nutshell, a couple of users are using the comments to accuse my student of copying the program without remixing, and my student is using the comments to accuse the other user of copying. there is a little name-calling as well. after all of the discussions we\\'ve had in class about proper etiquette and plagiarism, i don\\'t feel like i can just ignore it. some of the comments are visible in the studio i set up for the kids to share their programs. i was wondering how you would handle this as a teacher, or if referring it to scratch administrators is a more proper thing to do? thanks dawn\\n\\ni have 2 student that have idential scripts all the way down to the variable naming. i know this isn\\'t their work as they have never used this variable naming technique. also, they didn\\'t give credit or even remix the original. i wish there was a way to search scratch scripts so i can at least find the original work so i can show them their wrong doing.\\n\\n', '5232': \"hi, i am kyungwon koh, a doctoral candidate in school of library and information studies at florida state university. my research areas include youth

this. if there is one, please point me towards it. background: i\\'m an elementary and middle school technology teacher. i teach in a lab with 6-8th grade students and push into teachers\\' classrooms k-5 where students have access to chromebooks or ipads. i\\'m trying to integrage scratch and cs thinking to be across the regular ed curriculum but i\\'m running into a snag... my issue: i\\'d like to be able to create groups of students so that my student \"scratchers\" could participate in more than one class. for instance, i\\'d like to create a class under my account that students can particpate in during tech class and allow them to participate in another class that they can use in their regular-ed classroom - much like how code.org allows for student users to be monitored by multiple teacher\\'s accounts. currently i\\'m creating \"classes\" of students for each grade level so that they can use their account multiple years in a row and have access to them in more than one environment. ex: \"class of 2022\", etc. i have a feeling that creating different studios for each classroom environment is going to be the fix that i find, but i\\'m wondering if someone else has encountered this. this feature would be helpful so that students can keep their projects for multiple years instead of loosing access to their creations when a teacher \"ends\" the class. it also would students access to the backpack across multiple environments and across unpublished projects. thank you! :-) - rfb\\n\\nhi rfb, my name is christan balch and i work on the mit scratch team. currently it is not possible to move students from teacher to teacher or class to class. we are still in the process of thinking through what this flow might look like and apologize for any inconvenience this causes you. in the meantime, we do have a couple suggestions that would allow your students to keep their work. your idea of using studios is wonderful! this is something we\\'ve suggested in the past and i think that it would work well for the needs you are describing. if you do not want to use studios and/or each teacher wants to have students in their own, unique classroom, another possible option would be to make use of the remix feature. students can remix their work from one account to another. alternatively, they can also always download their projects from one account and reupload them into another. (even if a class has been \"closed\", shared projects can still be found remixed/downloaded.) i hope these suggestions help! christan\\n\\n', '13314': 'hi all. i joined scratch ed long ago and quickly left and never came back. instead, i began teaching scratch users nightly in the all about scratch forum (which has since changed titles) by helping them with their projects. my biggest concern was that hereat scratc ed,there seemed to be a lot of education terminology and normal school philosophy thrown about but it seemed like very few people actually understood scratch programing. i hope this has changed! please understand, i am not trivializing the hard work and good intentions of so many people. i just think that if you are going to teach it, you need to understand it and that takes more effort than organizing a lesson plan and maintaining order in a classroom. i have almost a lifetime of association with education in many forms and the inflexibility often forced in a classroom environment is a terrible thing and a crutch for those who don\\'t have an acceptable level of competency. the reason i am making this post is because i was contacted and asked to provide a lesson plan for a week long picoblocks class as i have taught a similar class before. picoblocks is a version of scratch designed to interface scratch programing with motorized legos like the wedo system. it utilizes a sensor board and is a lot of fun, which is critical to my way of teaching. below is my emailed response, provided for you as a glimpse into a successful realization of implementing scratch/picocrickets into a classroom along with some contemporary approaches to learning. i hope it inspires more of the same :) ___________________________________________________________________________________ (my old scratch ed post..) i teach classes at a local museum using picoblocks along with the wedo. picoblocks is a version of scratch written specifically to interface the wedo system along with the picocricket system. i have done both single day/ 3 hour classes and week long/ 4hour per day classes. so i have not established any set curriculum, especially that would apply to a long term class session however i would be happy to provide any help if desired. zac_ray@fastmail.fm i also have a scratch projects gallery, some of which i have used in my classroom here.(http://scratch.mit.edu/users/locomule) (the emailed request i recently received..) i was wondering if you have since written a plan/outline of something you use in a week long camp??? (and my reply, the point of this rambling, sorry..) i haven\\'t created a lesson plan but would be glad to help if possible. not knowing a potential instructors competency level with picoblocks-type programing is the biggest obstacle that i foresee. otherwise, i would need to know classroom details.. exact # of class days and how many hours per day approximate # of students and ages # of instructors # of computers running picoblocks in the classroom what wedo or lego sets are going to be used otherwise, i could provide some general concepts to be taken into consideration based on my experiences.. you cannot teach kids to program in a week so don\\'t plan on it, especially when combining programing with legos. but that is ok :) and all the more reason an instructor needs to be fluent in pico programing. classroom time will be limited so you must be able to teach and write and debug simple programs with confidence. most kids will not want to learn the programing either, not once they see each other building lego projects. i had the benefit of being allowed to teach my way, and i am not a big fan of typical lesson plans. i use them as guides, not hard and fast maps but then again, i am also an entertainer so i am fast on my feet. i prefer to be dynamic and respond to the changing needs of my classroom on the fly. i print out more activities, plans, etc than i need and divide them into 1) gotta do cool stuff and 2) kinda cool stuff. likewise, i separate these into groups based on how much time they take up. this allows me to make sure that the best information gets experienced while throwing in quick lessons in moments of extra time. if i run out of time, i know that i am leaving out my least favored stuff. i\\'ll touch on something at the end of this message called tinkering and how it fits into my teaching style and picoblocks. i first spent showed off some scratch games and stuff of my own, with a brief demonstration of how pico blocks get put together in a program. (scratch is the program that picoblocks is derived from and is almost the same thing) our picocrickets came with cards that had various project ideas. my students picked some out and made musical play-doh, a door alarm for our classroom, light sensors that set off multi-colored lights and various sounds such as cats meowing, horns, etc through a speaker. we did many other projects as well. we spent most of one day building projects that came with each wedo kit. some built moving sculptures, others built motorized windmills, etc. between classes, i used a couple of kits to make a motorized car with headlights that you could steer. i told them that we would do something similar on the last day. but by then i realized that we could not, as a class, build individual pico-driven cars and had too many students to build a single car. instead, we made a drag race track for them to race simple, custom-made, non-pico lego cars on, complete with a pico driven drag strip with a start/finish timing system with a red/yellow/green start light tree that lit up with slightly randomized light intervals. the students loved making the cars and then re-working them to improve their designs between races to make them faster. we made a big scoreboard on cardboard. it has been a while since i did this so i have forgotten many things, i\\'m sure. since i did taught picocrickets, i have become very good at scratch programing. i have also been sent to the exploratorium museum in san francisco and learned about tinkering. tinkering is the evolution of education as facilitated in a museum environment. sounds like a mouthful but it is really cool. the concept is based on the idea that we all learn in different ways so why force someone to use method a and ignore method b? for example, one tinkering project i participated in involved our group walking into a space that had 3 tables filled with odds and ends... spools, wires, batteries, small 1.5v dc motors, glue guns, masking tape, tongue depressors, plastic cups, etc. simple craft supplies. we were given minimal instruction, other than being shown how to hook batteries up to motors and how to use glue sticks to make an offset weight to attach to the motor. our goal was to make simple bots that moved around. afterwards, we discussed our individual methodologies. some people looked at the supplies and thought, \"hmmm, what could i make out of that?\" others came up with a mental image of their bot and then sought materials to make it with. that is exactly the point, we all still learned but in ways that made sense to the individual learner. tinkering is a way to provide open-ended solutions to a problem so that your audience can solve it their own way. in essence, they teach themselves. your job as a facilitator is to answer questions, give simple examples, and occasionally inspire more thinking by saying \"what if you...?\" the reason i mention tinkering is because my teaching style runs very parallel to tinkering philosophy. that is why to others, my \"lesson plans\" probably look rather vague. there is no \"9:00 am do this 10:30 do that\" etc. unless you repeat the same courses for many years, you won\\'t know exactly how long things will take or how popular they will be with your students. my #1 rule in my classroom is that we have fun, and do we ever. once the kids are having fun, they become inquisitive and begin teaching themselves and each other. you move from instructor to facilitator, but you have to be keenly aware of what is going on and quick to recognize when to jump in, jump out, or just observe. for example, one of the first questions once we started lego drag racing was \"why does my car keep losing?\" i (deliberately) said \"friction\" and turned around as if to walk off. \"what is that?\" was the cry from me behind me so i turned back and said \"ok, take one shoe off and leave the other on. now slide the socked foot, then try to slide the other foot with the shoe still on it. the reason the shoed foot won\\'t slide is easy is friction!\" then we got into how axles must rub against other parts of the car creating friction, how different wheels had varying properties of friction and smoothness of circular motion. friction was good for winning on our race course, but what about stopping a real car? now you need friction, big-time! in essence, we were tinkering. it was a great experience. i\\'m sorry this message is so long but i didn\\'t know how else to explain a zac ray lesson plan, heh. i judge my success on a few simple factors. i taught at a museum during the summer. parents who often were just looking for baby-sitting with an edge called back wanting to sign their kids up for \"whatever classes mr. zac is teaching.\" when it was time for lunch or to go home, students had to be forced out of their chairs. take me out of the equation because i am the least important factor and imagine a classroom where kids have fun learning and don\\'t want to stop. it is a beautiful thing! seeing this happen in a public school setting is a dream of mine. time after time, i saw public school teachers come in to teach other classes with that antiquated \"i\\'m gonna turn the lights on and off until you all settle down\" mentality and the kids suffered for it. learning became a drag, and who wants to be involved in that? no one, even if you force them to do it anyway.

any help would be much appreciated. thanks, david\\n\\nhi david, these are great questions. i think your approach of experimenting with different entry points and checking in often with the student to see what works for them is a good one. i've worked in inclusive classrooms with several students with autism and one thing i've found helpful to keep in mind is that each student with autism is as variable as any other learner (in terms of likes, dislikes, strengths and weaknesses). i wonder if some of the activities from the creative computing curriculum guide could be useful in this case. for example, you could sit with the student and let them click around the scratch interface, seeing what happens as they click? maybe you could look at a variety of projects (of their choosing) together and let them point out something they would like to be able to create or remix? for many students with autism, abundant choice and lack of structure is overwhelming, so perhaps an activity with constraints - like ten blocks (also from the cc guide) - would be a helpful place to start? a few other resources i found that might be helpful: here is a brief discussion of the ways in which the scratch online community can be helpful for some students with autism. here is a scratched discussion about working with students with disabilities. here is an article about programming and students with autism. here is a list of tips for teachers working with students on the autism spectrum. i hope some of this is useful. i hope we can continue this conversation and keep sharing resources. thanks, willa\\n\\nhi willa, pls forgive this tardy response, the articles and links provided were very helpful and i was looking through and trying to understand them. thank you very much for the links, i will try out some of the suggestions and will share again on my experience with the child. cheers! david\\n\\nhi david. i teach scratch children with intellectual disability. in the past when work with autism didn't know about scratch. but based on my experience, think that if you asked mother about special interest of her child. and create individual activity, it can help. for example if he like pirates make the scratch activities with use of pirates images.\\n\\n\", '22311': 'hola compa_eros en mi instituto queremos crear un club de tecnologa y me gustara introducir el scratch para enganchar a los alumnos en el mundo de la tecnologa ten_is alguna indea?

(rosemary slattery also spoke about this at the last scratched meetup.) whether it\\'s comments with the scripts or a description in the project notes, i feel like some documentation of a project is incredibly helpful and, therefore, a good habit. k\\n\\ndefinetly, comments will make it to the list of good habits. - and i was shown recently that the comments function in scratch is better than i though :)\\n\\nfor scratch beginners the worst problem is the glide block. its so easy but they they get frustrated that they cant do anything during the guide (not exactly true - but it is much better to do iterative movement).\\n\\n#name?\\n\\nother bad programming habits are 1. forgetting green-flag initialization. a project without green-flag initialization on the scratch.mit.edu website cannot be initialized unless the page is reloaded. 2. run the \"change ... effect\" without attaching it to a scenario and expect scratch to remember the setting dimitris\\n\\n- lack of comments in the scripts - lack of information to the user regarding what to do - when errors occur, not only to tell the user so but also how to fix them. - forgetting to initialize variables before using them. - variable names that do not reflect their contents. (using i, j or k for counting variables, for instance, is acceptable, but otherwise variable names should be realted to the program and the values they carry) - some students prefer to use: if condition then end if if not condition then end if instead of the if/else structure. using \"if/if not\" may be acceptable initially, but students should eventually transition to \"if/else.\" two problems with the \"if/if not\" are a) sometimes students do not negate the condition in the second \"if\" statement, but they write the opposite condition themselves, and they do not do so incorrectly. for example, \"if x < 10\" and \"if x > 10\" as the replacement for \"else\"... the case \"x=10\" is in limbo. b) there may be actions in the first conditonal that may also trigger the second conditional. i do not have a \"real life\" example in mind right now, but the following illustrates the idea. if x > 10 then ....x = x-5 end if if x <=10 then ....do something else here end if we can easily see that if, for example, x = 12 both conditionals become true! - recycling variables to hold different types. (this can be a really bad habit which needs to be fixed before they move on to other languages (like python) in which variable declarations are not needed, making matters worse.) what i mean with this is that, in some parts of the application a variable holds, say, a number, and later on a string is assigned to the same variable. - forgetting the \"stop script\" block at the end of a script. we know scartch stops scripts automatically, but since the block exists, we should use it. my hope is that getting used to ending scripts with this block will help students in the future remember to close open files, close socket connections, close database connections, etc. (i can dream, can\\'t i) if i can think of something else, i will post it. thanks\\n\\nhi angel, i have never required my students (grades 3-6) to use the comment part of scratch becuase i didn\\'t like how they were displayed and i think students would have a hard time explaining their code beyond reading through their blocks. what age group do you work with? how do you introduce comments? also, i have never thought to instruct students to use the stop script block when their code naturally ends. mostly, because a lot of what my students create .. never ends. it is an interesting thought though. do you explain that it stops anyways? how do you go about explaining the need for this block? i have thought of stop script more of a break statement and not a file close. maybe i have been misleading myself. susan\\n\\nhi susan, i teach kids quite a bit older than yours. using comments can be a great tool to help students plan (design) their scripts once they learn the basics of using scratch. think for example of someone learning woodworking: you first learn how to measure, cut, sand, make joints, select wood pieces, etc. once you have this basic level of mastery, you then move on to know how to make furniture, cabinets, etc. however, you would probably will not start making a chair without at least a basic scketch of what the chair is going to look like, what wood to use, what dimensions and so on. the way i see it, there are two main kinds of comments students should get used to. one that we use to explain how something was implemented. the idea here is to communicate to others (or to ourselves, for future reference) about how a fragment of code came to be. sometimes, we have a complex nested conditional structure, a tricky \"repeat until\", an intricate broadcasting system, or just a \"bunch\" of blocks trying to achieve a simple logical task in our program (for example, drawing the outline of a pine tree using the \"move\", \"turn\" and the pen blocks in the context of a winter scene). these are all great candidates to be documented. if something took a lot of (trivial) work to achieve, or effort to figure out, it should be documented. (superfluous comments, however, should be avoided.) the other kind of comments are related to the planning of the program. these are like the actions in a cooking recipe (e.g., \"whisk the eggs and sugar\" is a good comment for the set of steps needed to complete this task). i use them to oultine the different (high-level) actions a sprite is going to do. these comments can also be the result of a brainstorming session with the students about what the sprites should do, and in what order. the comments also help in keeping track of what has been implemented, and what is yet to be done. i attach these comments to their corresponding \"when\" blocks or to the first block implementing the action described in the comments. it is very tempting to start throwing blocks at scratch and see what it does, and this is ok when experimenting or learning new blocks. however, whenever you are building an application with the students (in a tutorial, for example), i think it is a good idea to provide an overall picture of what you are trying to do by using comments to describe the high-level actions your application will take. when assigning projects, you could have the students first describe what they want to achieve using comments. you can then check their \"plans\" and point out things that are missing, not clear, or just need a different approach.\\n\\ni was afraid that a topic like this one would come up sooner or later, and that we\\'re going to indoctrinate kids with what we as adults are considering to be \"best practices\", a term which in itself suggests an unhealthy dose of ideology. whenever i see a project on the scratch website that truly amazes me, looking at the code is a bit of a downer, because it\\'s usually full of gargantuan run-on scripts, global variables, forever loops and race conditions. but - and that\\'s my point - the project impressed me so much that i wanted to look at its code in the first place. scratch is cool precisely because kids can produce programmed content right away, without first having been instructed in what to avoid and what to adhere to. sure, more often that not the code is plain ugly, but - and that\\'s my point - that doesn\\'t stand in their way to create and share. so, you don\\'t *have* to initialize variables in scratch. nothing breaks of you don\\'t, they\\'re initially zero. you don\\'t *have* to use the green flag hat block, in fact, i often don\\'t. instead you can use - say - a mouse click or a keyboard event to trigger things (and to initialize and reset values). it\\'s okay to leave un-hatted blocks or incomplete stacks \"floating\" around the scripting area, because you can use them to debug your project (by double clicking on them) or as a quarry for features you might want to add later. it\\'s also perfectly okay to nest conditions if that makes it easier for you to keep track of your reasoning, instead of using - equally(!) - nested predicates. the \"stop script\" block\\'s *only* raison d\\'etre is to terminate a perpetual loop in case a stop condition has been met, surely not to end a script that just plain ends. what\\'s wrong with using just \"if\"? often times you plain don\\'t need an \"else\" case. so kids produce stacks of if conditions instead of deeply nested if/else ones. i can make out performance issues with this, but otoh i\\'d rather read a stack of simple conditions than a cluttered mess of nested ones. so, scratch variables don\\'t need to be \"declared\" (in fact, they do, when you \"make a variable\"), but they are not restricted to a certain type, and can store either a number or a string (or, in byob, even lists, sprites and blocks). is it really \"bad practice\" in the adult world to exchange a variable\\'s value with a differently typed other one? most modern programming languages let you do this, scratch itself is written largely that way, and it\\'s awesome (plus, it undoubtely works!) :-) most of what\\'s ugly in the scratch projects i\\'m talking about is rooted in scratch\\'s inability to allow for user-defined procedures. this deficiency forces kids into a copy & paste metaphor of creating code which is so hard to edit later on. but i understand that this issue is being addressed by the scratch team in their current rewrite for v2.0. until then, let\\'s not tell kids what\\'s \"right\" or \"wrong\" and let\\'s asses other programming languages for why so many of them cannot cope with \"child-like\" practices that are easily handled by scratch. let\\'s press those other languages to become more like scratch! ;-) --jens\\n\\ni understand your point and pretty much agree with it. i use these \\'best practices\\' to show students how they can improve their projects. if you cannot convince them that what you propose makes their scripts better, then they will not use it. there is nothing wrong with teaching students to organize and tidy-up things. i also have another goal in mind. after scratch, my students move to a non-graphical language in which, for example, indentation and variable types matter. so, i want to make them aware of things issues to help them with the transition.\\n\\non nested if\\'s: i agree with jens comment: \"i\\'d rather read a stack of simple conditions than a cluttered mess of nested ones.\" readability trumps performance in my mind for kids just starting to learn. the question i ask is which better facilitates understanding? talking to yourself (a good habit): i like to have kids read their code out loud. especially when trying to debug a problem. i will also ask them to explain what each tile will do and at times point/draw/explain what will happen when that particular block executes. early in my career, i had a mentor tell me to \"think like a computer\" and later in my career i had someone suggest i code out loud to try and understand what it does. i was amazed at how much reading out loud helped me. for one it slowed down my thinking and forced me to focus line by line instead of imagining what the next large chunk of code would do. i was often wrong when i guessed, especially since when i started to guess because it wasn\\'t doing what i expected, i had the wrong mental model/image of what was going on. first do the simplest thing possible to make it work, then refactor - kids are motivated to get someting to do what they want (play a game, imitate mario bros, etc). now the question is once they accomplished what they care about, how do you get them to the \"hard fun\" and have them refactor (which i will define as:clean up their code to improve readability, reduce complexity and increase maintainabilty)? good quesiton, suggestions welcomed ;) as they now have accomplished their goal, what is the point (ie: why should the kids care, if it does the same thing). one way i try and deal with this is if multiple kids are working on the same task and one accomplishes it with a \"more elegant\" script, is to have the the one kid show their script to the rest of the class. i may then also add specific words and comments as to why i like that script and how it is much better than one i wrote (i always try to make myself the fool as opposed to one of the kids, plus it comes naturally to me ;) user defined procedures/blocks: amen. this is really needed. also something akin to siblings in etoys where sprites share a common script (but the variable values can be different) would be very useful and avoid the copy and paste we are teaching (a really bad habit, i see too often, and i\\'m not talking about kids i am talking about \"professional programmers\".) \"what is the best method to obtain the solution toaproblem? the answer is, any way that works\" - richard feynmannew textbooks for the \"new\" mathematics.\\n\\nstephen, interesting remarks. i like the read-aloud idea, i will try it in my next classes. re.first do the simplest .... yes, it is hard to get the kids to put back their code on the workbench for the sake of \"easthetic\" improvement. i wonder if ishould try to get them to read their code a couple of weeks later, to get them to experience how hard it is to decipher programmer\\'s intentions \"from the outside\", therefore persuading them that a bit of tyding is useful. to all:thanks for your contributions - despite my silence ihave been watching this and hopefully will incorporate this in my next classes !\\n\\ni agree with most of the thoughts about good and bad practices here, except one. commenting your code is a practice that is never too early to implement. commenting the code makes the code more readable; not only for the coder, but for anyone who reads it. have you ever looked at a scratch project that had no comments in the code? was you able to follow it; to understand what was happening? i\\'m sure some people can, but not everyone will be as familiar with the code. coding comments also helps the coder throughout their coding processes. have you ever stopped in the middle of a project, only to find when you came back you had to refresh your memory about what you were doing and what you wanted to do next? along with commenting the code, i also have students keep a journal for each project which will contain the basic concept for their project, notes, questions, needs, and a psuedocode workup. another great reson for code commenting is your students are using/improving thier language skills.\\n\\ni\\'m a little late getting to this thread, but if anyone is still interested... in my colllege cscourses itell my students that any time i\\'m tempted to put a comment in my own code, itake that as a sign that ishould rewrite that section of code instead, to be less clever. this isn\\'t because idon\\'t want program documentation. but iwant it to be high-level, a text file separate from the program that explains its data structures, the large structure of the program, the user interface, and so on. along with reasons, if known, why things are organized this way rather than some other way. none of that lends itself to inline comments in the code. as for the other things, iagree with jens that for kid programmers (up through age 18 or so) there\\'s no such thing as a bad programming practice. there are better programming practices, and sometimes i\\'ll try to teach one to a particular kid. but presenting kids with the sort of list of commandments attempted in this thread just makes programming skool, instead of being fun.\\n\\nwhenever possible code should be self documenting and require a minimal number of comments.... (as code gets older these comments will often get copied and then the code underneath modified away from the original meaning). a functional call with a descriptive name is often better than a comment. having said that, any time you make assumption you should document them with comments... here is a typical monolithic program with everything in one procedure....it is documented with comments, but compare it with below... here is a more modularized approach... the main routine is shorter and you only need to concern yourself with the external calls if there is a problem in that code, and then you have a smaller chunk of code to deal with. incidentally, this code is just to illustrate a point, it can certainly be improved.. also if you are using byob, do yourself a favor and create this block (it is just a function block named \"//\" with a text input field): it will allow you to insert comments in blocks or anywhere.\\n\\n', '26413': \"the weekly roundup is where the scratched team shares some of the major -- as well as some of the overlooked -- news, stories, and events related to scratch that took place throughout the week. scratched weekly roundup 03/22/14 - 03/28/14 join us for the next scratch educator meetup at mit taking place this saturday, april 5. attend this free event, which includes lunch and can count towards pdp points. - http://scratched.media.mit.edu/node/26346 thescratch jr.kickstarter project reached its goal of $25k but there's still time to pledge. check out the new stretch goals and new reward! - https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2023634798/scratchjr-coding-for-young-kids check out the latest updates to the scratch website including fixing glitches and speedups. - http://scratch.mit.edu/discuss/topic/32998 want to learn more about trademark law in relation to scratch?

there are advantages in terms of resource use, but the rest of us have moved on.\\n\\na blog post submitted/reblogged by \"fyprocessing,\" a tumblr site devoted to the work of artists experimenting with processing, offers an interesting point of view with regard to the different expressive potentials offered by different programming environments. it suggests that different imaginaries, or different imaginations, may be sparked or accessed by interaction with different tool kits. the argument echoes clifford geertz and marshall macluhan\\'s observation that humans shape and are then subsequently shaped by our tools. the link for the original is: http://fyprocessing.tumblr.com/post/69317286302/hamoid-my-first-animgif-programmed-in-nodebox and i quote it here in its entirety: my first animgif programmed in nodebox. i still prefer code, but i see the advantages of nodebox: pause, play and rewind your animation. go to the previous and next frames. tweak values and modify your program *while it runs*. no need to stop and restart your program. this is great for experimentation. export a range of frames. export an mp4 movie or a vector pdf file. you can write your own modules in python and clojure. what i dont like: no animgif nor gif export. each time i export i must set the range and file format. frame rate not so high. no access to the great collection of processing libraries (midi, webcam, graphic tablet, osc, etc). its great for people learning to code, and for those who dont like typing code. it may also be great for sketching concepts, tweaking values and experimenting, to later port the idea to an environment that performs faster. our creations are influenced by the tools we use. i suspect the kinds of creations we produce by typing code (processing, open frameworks, supercollider) and by connecting nodes with wires (nodebox, pd) can differ, the same way the kinds of results we get when using different programming languages can also be different. for instance, some languages make it easier to write recursive programs. other languages make it easy to work with big data sets, or with strings. i wonder what is nodebox best at?\\n\\ni\\'ve been teaching scratch for a number of years, and a coworker and i would often have this back and forth. i\\'d say i wasn\\'t a programmer, he\\'d argue that i could use scratch, so i could program. now i am student in karen brennan\\'s class, and am thinking about this question in my final paper. i try and draw parallels to other things i know how to do, using imovie is editing video but is not as powerful as using final cut studio, but i\\'d still say they are both video editing. so, why, in my head is scratch not programming or programming in the same sense but just lacks some of the capabilities of other languages. i think for me it has something to do with identifying as a \"programmer,\" but i am still trying to break that down. @rafael, i am compelled by the idea of different environments supporting or leading to different potentials, that begins to take away some of the heirarchy between text and visual based programming. i wonder how many people on this thread do know how to program in a text based language. i think its probably valuable to foster the identity of a \"programmer\" in youth in scratch classes i am facilitating, but its still struggle with calling myself a programmer.\\n\\n@peter, i\\'m glad that this idea is compelling for you. :) in the visual arts, part of the training/learning/discovery is what expressive potentials and opportunities exist with which \"media\" and \"substrates\". pencils, brushes and crayons offer different things. it\\'s easy for me to forget this, or to treat it as transparently self-evident. sometimes, when i\\'m feeling mischievous, i think about the range of expression possible with a hammer and a piano. both could be seen as percussive uses of a lever. ;)\\n\\ni believe that scratch programming is directly linked to javascript. it has all the same features, and a lot more. if the person that emailed you doesn\\'t know javascript, but wants to know, show them this website: www.codecademy.com i am actually working on a scratch-javascript converter right now. they are that similar. hope this helped you karen!\\n\\n', '22891': '\"hour of code\" is taking place during computer science education week (december 9-15, 2013). if you\\'re looking for a scratch activity, you might be interested in the scratched team\\'s \"interactive holiday card\" activity, which includes a teacher guide, a handout, and a self-guided tutorial. this thread was started in october 2013 to imagine the possibilities for the \"hour of code\"... what should someone\\'s first hour of programming look like? what activities might you have them do? what projects might show them? what might the essence of the experience include? share your ideas in the thread below...\\n\\nquestions from the group with rosemary, lorraine, sandie -- how do we think about age range? what elementary school students can do in an hour will look different than what high school students might do. what do you give people ahead of time? what happens when you start with a blank screen vs. you start with something that you can remix. how do we help the learners end with a finished product? how do we show what\\'s possible? start with a video that includes snippets of what\\'s possible, \"this is what scratch is for\" and \"here\\'s what can be done\" and \"make something amazing\" and \"your imagination is the only boundary\". what other resources might be possible? scratch cards. (tips window have no surprise.) project ideas -- something fishy: interactive aquarium experimenting with the dot: adding interactivity to simple graphics bring it to life: bring two prescribed objects to life goals for the hour -- for the opening: snippets of range of possibility (movement, sound, interactivity) (getting an account or not) getting to building right away varies for standalone vs. group: some sharing via studio or in class\\n\\ngreat point from ingrid: how do we deal with the logistics of \"hour of code\" in the school environment? an hour becomes two blocks.\\n\\nfrom ingrid\\'s google doc interactive art using the sound/keyboards to draw in 10 block challenge good way to get started watched examples of things that were created in 10 block challenge - this is how i did my 10 block challenge community project how can all these projects come together scratch cards 1 pagers tying it into particular subject areas remixing a project remix starter projects dancing - starting with a premade projects involve different media as much as possible sound/music/graphics utilizing the tips window in scratch - having a specific scratch hour of code steps window stand alone vs. teacher avoid being a tutorial sample projects nice graphics voice video sensors racing connections with other people/greeting cards/birthday cards characters dancing stick figure in different poses - programming them to script them in different positions, add music, kids dance along group 2 simulations/games related to particular subject areas music in projects pen tools to write names have them write their name with the pen tool group 3 doing a theme - like something fishy bringing simple shapes/dots to life interactions so many potentials with just a simple dot narration and throwing out ideas of what people have done in scratch give people ideas because the blank screen is intimidating backwards design - i want to do this - what types of steps do you need to take to get there partner students up to complete projects\\n\\nideas from lorraine: the idea of \"scratch pals\", sharing ideas and artifacts between learners (potentially people who are on opposite sides of the earth).\\n\\ncultural comparison: what is 5th grade in japan like compared with 5th grade in the united states\\n\\npriya suggested connecting with others via epals other sources of connections via lorraine: scratched website, scratch day website\\n\\nlooks a great idea but is this just for us schools/students? i hope the material will be made available outside of the us. i think there would need to be number of activities depending on age range and ensure that part of the time is spent explaining what has been achieved at the end of the session. would expect some very simple game for u10\\'s (e.g. very simple maths e.g. what is 2+3?), a little more advanced for u13\\'s and maybe something to control something e.g. turn on a motor or led for older children. all achievable using scratch (of course :-) ). clearly the material to be used needs to be \\'road-tested\\' and suitable for use on different equipments (not just pcs, macs, but also machines such as raspberrypi and tablets). there also need to be enough supporters to help as the poor teacher won\\'t be able to cope on their won. when i have done \\'hour coding sessions with 9/10 year olds, i find that the ratio of at least 1 supporter for 5 children is essential. this ratio can increase for older children but it does depend on the ability of the students.\\n\\ni\\'m still a big fan of scratch cards. . . i had great success with 9th/10th graders using the following strategies: have previous/experienced scratch student open with brief project presentation. either student or instructor gives cursory intro to the scratch interface. group students in clusters of 4-5, one student per laptop. students are given 2 minutes to create account, start new project and choose one sprite at random. each group given 4-5 different scratch cards. announce they have 2 minutes to try out the block/technique on their card. after 2 minutes yell, \"switch,\" and they all pass their card and add new block to their project. do this 4 times then yell, \"scratch.\" now instead of switching cards, students move to the next computer and modify that person\\'s project. after 4 \"scratches\" everbody returns to their seats to check out what has become of their original project. if time permits, do gallery walk and/or ask for volunteers to present their scratched scratch project. ticket to go is adding their project to a scratch studio created for that specific class. can broaden by having a grade- or school-wide studio. my goal in developing the above procedure was to immediately engage students, filter the possibly overwhelming block-based coding environment into just 1 block at a time and focus their energy on coding rather than spending 20 minutes browsing canned-clipart. the shifting of seats not only keeps things lively, but also removes some of the attachment to project outcome, as well as physically demonstrating the idea of collaboration and remixing.\\n\\ni have middle schoolers in a semester long class. some are currently avid scratchers. i\\'m wondering how to use them as resources to teach the other students. i like derek\\'s idea and maybe i could send them each out with a pack of cards and directions. i\\'m thinking of asking science or math teachers for a class period and they could have laptops for all their kids or pairs of kids. i like karen\\'s idea of starting with a \\'this is possible\\' video. currently, i use this one in class: http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=jxdw-t3xwd0 it\\'s from thestarting_from_scratch_learner.pdf curriculum i have my students do for a couple of weeks as an intro. of course, there\\'s the problem of kids who already program in the class with non-programmers, but they could be resources. maybe a combination of ideas--total newbies use the cards, slightly familiar with use the 10 block challenge, others create a simple game in scratch or remix something with specific goals in mind. we have a a 7-12 grade american-style school and my kids are 7-8 grades. we have some hsers who have done scratch, but most haven\\'t. i\\'d like everyone to have a chance at it before they leave school, so the hour of code is a great way to start. i\\'m also wondering what tutorials will be available at the hour of code site:http://csedweek.org/resource_kit/tutorial\\n\\nhowdy folks, i\\'m glad to have stumbled across this thread (and derek, glad to know that you\\'re a part of it). i\\'m heading up efforts to help learners 6-18 at a very large network of afterschool institutions (sorry, can\\'t name names in a google-able thread!) engage in the hour of code, and wanted to share my perspectives on the space. basically, we\\'re hoping that staff at participating organizations are able to run hourlong sessions using scratch, kahn academy or code academy. iknow for a fact that, at many organizations, one or more staff have some familiarity with scratch. this makes it a great candidate. however, their familiarity is entirely variable and their confidence in self-generating hourlong implementation objectives isn\\'t a given. in general, their anticipation is that we (meaning me, from the hq)can provide more specific guidance about how best to utilize scratch in that one hour session. so, i\\'ve been looking forward to the outcome of this thread. with that in mind, here are some of the opportunities and constraints that i\\'ve seen: i\\'ve found the \\'scratch cards\\' most helpful &hadn\\'t know of their existence until this thread. because the afterschool space tends to be a bit chaotic, i\\'d avoid \\'switching stations\\' too frequently, or at all. computer station audio is not a given, but it does exist. so we have to plan on scenarios that don\\'t rely on instructional video, although instructional video could enrich the session. we could presume that instructors can step in if audio/video isn\\'t a possibility. ilove the idea of generating anew, particularly with a very concrete goal in mind (animate two objects), but also see the value of remixing (a different sort of tinkering). if the later, it would be awesome to use that experience to help entry-level scratchers get a sense of [loco]motion and perhaps, even variables. i\\'d love to use this as an opportunity to shift the instructor - learner paradigm a bit. when a learner or group is struggling with a logic question, why not turn that to the class to resolve? our educators don\\'t always feel this empowerment (often try to answer the question themselves). what would an hour of using scratch look like with a 1:2+ computer:learner ratio? from my vantage, goals for the hour include: growing staff and learner familiarity with scratch teaching some of the basics engaging learners in problem-solving of modest, reasonable complexity describing how an understanding of scratch can lead toward \\'real-world\\' code tinkering indicating a \\'what next\\' (which might be very much specific to this organization) which means that a session could: introduce scratch through brief dialoge w or w/o video (5 mins) introduce an intiial simple problem (move from point a to point b)(10 mins) introduce additional logic (loop to draw a shape) (10 mins) apply in the context of a remix to solve a problem (e.g., activate c when a hits b) (30 mins, fuzzy) recap / talk through challenges / solutions / what next (5 mins) so... those are some perspectives on my approach to the day and scratch space. perhaps it\\'ll be helpful food for thought as the materials evolve?here\\'s to hoping so! cheers, --dave\\n\\nthe problem i\\'m having with using the scratch during that week, is access. our computers at school have deep freeze so not allowed to download to pcs. scratch 2.0 is web based but then you have the problem of creating accounts for everybody. my after school group i created 25 accounts with my email. but now that we are going to start a new group and end this one, do i recycle those accounts or create new ones. back to the hour of code,i have created some projects for the kids to remix and play with but haven\\'t figured out yet how to give them access. i did put scratch 1.4 on our shared drive was going to see if the downloadable 2.0 would work from the shared drive. but then there is a long process for students to open and use. first have to go to shared open scratch, then go back to share and open project. any ideas, i plan on our school doing the hour of code, from kindergarten to 5th grade. planning on using scratch for grades 3-5.\\n\\nstudents do not need an account to create a project in scratch 2.0, however without an account they will not be able to save their project. if you want/need them to crate and save a new project you might get away with creating just 1 group account--then each student use their name for project name (first name & last initial for privacy). the advantage of this method is seeing all of their projects when you are logged into that account.\\n\\none possibility: speed racer - a 1-hour scratch introduction\\n\\nhi everyone, thanks for all of the suggestions -- your ideas were incredibly helpful in developing the tutorial. a draft of the tutorial is available at http://scratch.mit.edu/hoc. helen, josh, michelle, and i would love testing help -- let us know if you spot any typos, bugs, or broken links! we\\'ll also be working on resources for teachers to accompany this self-guided tutorial. please let me know what would be helpful as accompaniment to what\\'s in the http://scratch.mit.edu/hoc tutorial. thanks! k\\n\\nhi karen, the tutorial looks great.  i got just one question. due to bandwidth and account issues, i have installed the beta offline scratch 2.0 on my computers in the lab, and was planning on having my students use that until the teacher accounts came online. i just now downloaded the tutorial and open it in the beta offline scratch 2.0 but when i open the file the entire tutorial is missing. am i doing something wrong or can the tutorial not be used with the beta offline scratch 2.0?\\n\\nhi sandy, the tutorial is something that currently lives online. (i\\'m hoping to have a downloadable version available, but let me see what might be involved.) thanks! k\\n\\ndear karen, when i introduce scratch, i say that is a \"learning environment\", because to say it is a 2language of programming\" is something reductive. i would like to change also on wikipedia. what do you think? beatrice\\n\\nthe tutorial is great! i plan on my entire school participating in the hour of code, so i have a few questions about the tutorial. if a student and teacher has no experience with scratch and tries to follow the tutorial, they may become frustrated when trying to create the sprites that are in the tutorial. i think maybe we should have a tutorial that uses backgrounds, sounds and sprites that are available in scratch. from my experience the students will want to create the project as shown. if these are to be where the student needs little teacher intervention or if its a teacher who has no experience, the tutorial needs to be simple and easy to follow with no extras such as using the paint interface, importing of images etc.\\n\\ndoris, i was thinking the same thing. i was going to make that suggestion and then i thought i would just provide my students with a folder on their desktop of holiday/winter themed graphics. for me that is no big deal and importing in scratch is easy, however if for the inexperience teacher it might be an issue.\\n\\nhi doris, thanks for the feedback. we\\'ll be adding a collection of holiday-themed assets to the library soon. k\\n\\nthanks that would be great!\\n\\nmy problem with doing that is we have deep freeze and can not save on desktop. usually i save on a shared drive for students, but most of my students ( hate to say it but teachers also) need help getting there. i think if they include some holiday themed items that would solve the problem. just found out today our music teacher is having a sub that week, so i need it simple lol\\n\\nmy school used to have deep freeze, too. i got in the habit of creating a starter project which included a default set of sprites, then had each student remix it. you can also include any instructions/goals/even a rubric as the starting screen, which they can then hide/delete. this has the additional advantage of seeing all of their projects listed as remixes of your original project (now availabe in the fun \"remix tree\" view), an instant online project portfolio ready for assessment and/or showing off.\\n\\ni posted several lessons for hour of code aligned to the middle school common core state standards. they are more proof that it can be done than anything actually user-tested... but maybe someone can take and adapt.\\n\\nderek, it never occurred to me to use the remix tree in that manner. what an excellent suggestion...thanks!\\n\\nall of you are providing great resources! very good! we are organizing an hour of code for 72 people (36 couples child + parent). our workshop will be slightly longer, it will have 2.5 hours in duration. we will divide them into two levels: those who already know how to program in scratch and those yet don\\'t. to design the exercises, we find great inspiration in proposals by derek breen, brian foley, and the tutorial of the sratched team (great videos!). we have also liked the studio of projects to remix that has created adriano parracciani (cyberparra). to reserve a place, we are using eventbrite, which is a great resource to follow and to be in touch with all the people who enroll in the workshop. also, they don\\'t charge anything if the event organized is free. do you know if is this the studio to share the creations that everyone do? http://scratch.mit.edu/studios/270514/ to share the projects... should we suggest to people to create his own account? or we should create a unique profile for use by all? a big hug, marta\\n\\nhi marta, the hour of code studio is available at http://scratch.mit.edu/studios/279432 an account for each person is probably easiest... thanks! k\\n\\nyou can also use the backpack. create a starter project and let your students drag the sprites they want to use into their backpacks. when they create a new project they can also use their assets from the backpack.\\n\\nthank you brian! i found a video tutorial of your \"speed racer game\" in youtube, by amy cox. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyllzopeday\\n\\nhi karen, where can we find the holiday-themed sprites & backdrops that arebeing used for the scratch event? thank you. marianne\\n\\ncreated this:scratch.mit.edu/projects/14804494/ based on the ideas from scratch. however, i am linking in the common core state standards in math and ela and having the skills build on each other as the grade levels progress.\\n\\nhi, love your idea of the holiday cards for the hour of code activity. i was wondering if someone could quickly add some holiday-related sprites? you picture a snowman, tree, and gift, but none of them are found in the library. while, of course, it\\'s possible for the kids to draw their own, for those of us who are not skilled artists, you\\'re adding a layer of complication that could stop some kids in the first step of the tutorial. they will either balk at having to draw, whine that there are none available, or spend so long drawing just the perfect sprites that they never get on to the coding part. maybe someone is already hard at work doing this, if not, if someone could add some appropriate sprites and backgrounds, it would help. if needed, i can ask my daughter to whip some up and i\\'ll email them to you to add.\\n\\nmy thoughts also. it was mentined they were going to add some holiday themed sprites and backgrounds. hopefully these will be ready by next week.\\n\\nthanks!! the kids say their cute!i have my class of guinea pigs trying them out. weird thing, though, on my computer, chrome does not display the holiday sprites while iedoes. however, the kids can get them using either. i\\'m sad. :-) i also pulled some sprites from cards already on your site and put them in a folder along with the hoc word doc on our kids\\' common drive and google driveso they can access them that way, too.\\n\\nhttp://scratch.mit.edu/projects/15055329/ idid it! i\\'m so good.\\n\\ni checked after what you said about chrome, my pc does not display them either in chrome, but they are there in ie and firefox.\\n\\nfor those who have asked about holiday-themed sprites and backgrounds, a new theme titled \"holiday\" has been added to sprites and backgrounds library! also, if you haven\\'t already, i encourage you to check out the scratch hour of code teacher guide at https://scratched.gse.harvard.edu/hocand scratch holiday card handout at

with us, and we hope you\\'ll join us in celebrating csedweek next week! sincerely, michelle, on behalf of the scratched team\\n\\nseveral people mentioned that they didn\\'t see the holiday-themed sprites and images in their chrome browswer. if you have this problem, try clearing the browser cache (go to the chrome menu and select \"clear browsing data\"). happy hour of code!\\n\\nhi michelle, is there a way to update the scratch 2.0 offline editor to include the holiday themed sprites and backdrops?\\n\\nhi sandy, the latest version of the offline editor now includes the new holiday

1980 but lack a background in education. i've found it very frustrating, this apparent lack of interest in the public schools to teach cs. i looked into an m. ed. in secondary education program at my alma mater, west chester university, and cs is not even an approved concentration area. but they do offer a level i post baccalaureate teacher certification program _ elementary education, with a concentration for grades 4-8. so i need to get my teaching credentials first, and then i will have this uphill battle which is the subject of your blog. i have joined the csta but they are focused on public education, so i either need to get into the public school system or just teach this subject through workshops or one-on-one tutoring. but the good news is i've discovered scratch. i'm now writing my first program with it, which is the game reversi. this was actually the same game i used to learn programming back in 1980, using assembly language on an atari computer. i think it will be a good test of scratch's capabilities. i'll let you know how it goes. i hope there is some more discussion of this very important subject you've brought up here. steve williams\\n\\nlook at the

the application of metacognitive strategies in contexts other than those in which they were learned is the primary goal of teaching thinking. transfer is the educational term for this reuse of strategies. research supports a positive correlation between instruction in metacognitive strategies and transfer. a distinction is usually made between near transfer and far transfer, the former being when learning is applied in circumstances similar to initial learning, and the latter occurring when connections are made to dissimilar contexts. inif minds matterperkins and salomon (1992) talk about the fuzziness of near-far transfer and the difficulty in measuring the extent of transfer. in reporting on research in metacognition in \"metacognition research andtheory: analysis and implications for instructional design\"osman and hannafin (1993) manage to defuzz the issue of transfer by classifying metacognitive training strategies into four types, each of which promote transfer somewhat differently. these additional benchmarks allow educational practictioners to gauge transfer more accurately and design instruction which exploits the transfer potential of different metacognitive strategies. it is this classification scheme that has repeatedly drawn me back to this particular article, an article that at once clarifies both metacognition and transfer, and has practical application to instructional design. it is this perspective that serves as a backdrop for the remainder of this report, a report which presents my interpretation of this article. as criteria for their classification of metacognitive training strategies osman and hannafin (1992) used \"training approach\" and \"relationship to lesson content\". they describe metacognitive training strategies that may beembedded, or integrated within a criterion lesson and strategies which may be taught separately -detached- from academic subjects. with respect to the role of lesson content strategies may be dependent on, or independent of, content.content-dependentstrategies focus explicitly on concepts that promote learning of particular content. conversely,content-independentstrategies are content-free, general strategies not specific to particular academic subjects. the four resultant strategies are described below. embedded content-dependent strategies embedded content-dependent strategies emphasize near transfer. they are useful in understanding unfamiliar lesson material. they are specific strategies that support particular content and as such require explicit manipulation of lesson content and structure. embedded content-independent strategies embedded content-independent strategies are general strategies that support particular content but are transferable to content of other lessons. specific content is used to learn strategies but once learned executive control shifts from the lesson to the student. detached content-dependent strategies detached content-dependent strategies are general strategies taught separately from content but meant to be applied within particular content. the intention is to improve facility with strategies before using them in context. they hold more potential for transfer than embedded content-dependent strategies. detached content-independent strategies detached content-independent strategies are taught separately from content and are generic in nature. as such they support a variety of learning tasks and academic subjects. they help students to manipulate lesson material as well as to develop and maintain learning strategies. these strategies often focus more on procedural than conditional knowledge but the goal is strategy generalization and promotion of independent learning. they provide the greatest potential for transfer, that of far transfer. what is metacognition?

maker. i've had success with girls using scratch, but boys prefer game maker . game maker is intuitive and looks more like a shooter up video game. on the other hand scratch really teaches the kids how to program. if you use scratch, my advice, is to have prepackaged cool scratch tricks up your sleeve to start. these tricks can demonstrate how cools scratch is, so no one gets frustrated with how difficult it is. both communities have great online presence. scratch's presence is a more appropriate and kid friendly environment. game maker is more graphic, but still jacob hapgood does a great job with keeping his program free and updated. i work a lot with asperger kids, who love computing and i have found that whatever programming environment you put in front of them, they will do great things, without much guidance. last but not least, the one trick that has been tremendously successful is to have the more advanced students tutor the less advanced students. everyone likes this. in general, i teach computer science in high school using game maker, realbasic, and java. i'm still trying to get scratch to be taught in the lower grades. it's an uphill battle.\\n\\n\", '28211':

translating the built-in help: i started to teach a kid and it was great to have the scratch interface in dutch but when we try to get help related to various blocks, we saw that the information was only in english. iwonder whether there\\'s a convenient way to add translations to the built-in help system, e.g. by translating it to dutch.\\n\\nhi emre, have you looked at http://info.scratch.mit.edu/translationand http://info.scratch.mit.edu/translation/translating_scratch_materials? there\\'s more information about the translation process. hope that helps, k\\n\\nhello karen, thanks a lot for the pointers, and yes, http://info.scratch.mit.edu/translation/translating_scratch definitely helps. i\\'m curious about one thing more: do you have any information about the new version (due to updated translation) release process. in other words, let\\'s assume that i have used the workflow described above and translated the built-in help into dutch, how long would it take for the others to be able to download an updated version of scratch with the updated translation?\\n\\nthat\\'s a great question -- but, unfortunately, i don\\'t know the answer. it\\'s complicated by the fact that we\\'re working on a major revision to scratch, which i imagine will impact the translation process. let me ask my colleagues, and i (or they) will get back to you!\\n\\nhi emre - nice to e-meet you! as it stands now, there are no plans to release additional versions of scratch based on the scratch 1.4 codebase. so it won\\'t be possible for others to download and install a version of scratch with updated help files until scratch 2.0 is released - probably in late 2012. however - if you do translate the help files and send them to us, we\\'ll make them available on our languages resource page: http://info.scratch.mit.edu/languages so it will be possible for people to download your translated help files and manually install them in scratch 1.4 (replacing the english versions that are included by default). but this must be done manually, so it\\'s not ideal for most end-users. the good news is that scratch 2.0 will be all \"in the cloud\" - meaning it will run in the browser, and won\\'t require scratchers to download or install anything. this will make it much easier for us to update translations. as soon as we get a new translation, we can make it live in scratch 2.0. hope this helps. please do let me know if you have additional questions. best, amos\\n\\nkaren, amos, thank you very much again for the detailed answers and drawing my attention to scratch 2.0. in this case i think i\\'ll proceed with the current version as it is.\\n\\ndear emre, feel free to contact me through joek at scratchweb dot nl. maybe we could join forces

to support literacy in some way and would be interested in talking about your experiences? please let me know either via email (kbrennan at mit dot edu) or in the comments. thanks, k\\n\\nkaren, i of course i would love to talk to you. i have just begun writing up my findings, and today i wrote this letter of introduction that you might be interested in. this is just the very beginning of my work. i will send me an email and perhaps we can talk. i want to collect statistics (hence your book) etc. i had been a computer programmer for many years and after ta-ing at harvard extension, for a friend, in distributed java i decided to switch careers and retrain as a teacher. at the age of 53, i found my vocation. i retrained at harvard extension with sue being my premier teacher while i earned my instructional technology licensure. six years later, i teach a basic programming and game making course, an introduction to object oriented/ java course which includes a summation game component, and an ap java exam course at marshfield high school. during my first year of teaching, i was fortunate to have a bright and talented student on the autistic spectrum. i immediately saw the compelling connection between students on the spectrum and computer programming. although programming is thought of as a solitary act, it can be the students first positive social experience, and indeed, can serve as a potential and viable career path. i immediately spoke with the marshfield school district head of special education, ms. susan dupuis, and within minutes had an after-school marshfield kids konnection class teaching (mits scratch programming environment) to special needs students from kids 8 to 12. in addition, i began tutoring students wanting extra guidance. my work with the students on the spectrum has been very gratifying and successful. for six years now, i have been teaching high school computer programming classes, running private classes, and holding tutoring session, and have watched with great gratification and satisfaction students exceed all academic expectations, and enjoy social possibilities never expected from programming experiences. i am working with the scratch team and am in the process of writing my complete findings. young talented autistic students find a comfort zone and interest they had not found before. these students go from invisible students to marshfield icons through their work that transform them into game-making super-stars. the affordances do not stop there; the younger students that i work with scratch discover a new medium that captures their interest in a way that is so all consuming that it is fascinating to watch. a serious young student of 12 that i have worked with for three years best describes my work with less talented autistic students. interestingly, his enthusiasm for scratch is not daunted by his lack of progress or (at least my definition of progress). he has always kept his work private, and i was forbidden to post his work to my web site. during this scratch day at mit by the time i sat down, he had proudly showed his work to his father and the entire table. i was flabbergasted and delighted, walked away with the assurance that he and his dad did not need my help. i wish i could say my efforts to get a scratch component taught in the lower grades have been successful, but for 6 years i have advocated and been turned down by the administration. therefore, i have chosen to put my efforts into integrating scratch in all school special education units where they are more receptive, and in all honesty, where i personally get the most satisfaction. i could go on but i think you have read quite enough already. i have two web sites; one is for my private work at http://vickigold.com and the other is for my marshfield high school work at http://goldclasses.com. i would truly appreciate an opportunity to talk with you about my work, and the direction you think i could go. thank you for listening. vicki gold\\n\\ndear ms. gold, this is so interesting. i am a multimedia teacher and professional developer in queens new york. i also work with students on the spectrum. right now i am observing how 2 students on the spectrum interact with scratch. my study is focusing on using bogs/scartch for blogging. e.g. do students give feedback - click the heart? do they write a comment? how much support is needed? scripts? will students eventually make friends or follow specific scartchers? i am writing to you in hopes that you have had some experience with this aspect of using scratch with your students on the spectrum? have you focused on the \"commenting\" aspect of the program? what have been your experiences. what potential do you see? i look forward to

thinking mean to you?\" what do you think?\\n\\n1. thinking logically 2. a step by step process used to solve a problem\\n\\nmy first reaction to the question about computational thinking.....is the ease of moving around in a computer enviroment. it includes knowing some of the language and understanding the differences and the similarities between different enviroments, and being able to aply the knowledge you have in different enviroments.\\n\\ni started out thinking that computational thinking was the idea that computing is an expression of logic, like order of operations in mathematical thinking. i also assumed that it included problem solving and processing. but i have now added that idea that computational thinking includes seeing the world and expressing myself in new ways using the computer. it also includes creative collaboration ... or is that thinking creatorate or collabreate?\\n\\nusing computers to solve problems or present the solution in a different way or media\\n\\ncomputational thinking is using computers or technology to better understand something. it is also using computers or technology to express or share your thoughts or your understanding of something. but, having seen what anne marie wrote - i am thinking that she is correct in saying that it is thinking logically and using a step by step process. hmmm - maybe it isn\\'t necessarily tied to computers or technology.\\n\\ni think computational thinking is thinking about how to solve a complex problem or task by breaking it down into a sequence of simple tasks. it also includes thinking about the efficiency and effectivness of different methods to solve the same problem.\\n\\nmy first thought was basic - if then. my second thought was higher order thinking, working all the way up from the raw zeros and ones to the how, why and what ifs using a computer and its tools along the way.\\n\\nmy first reaction to the word computational is to think about numbers and alogrithms and rote learning. i have to shift my connotation of the word \"computational.\" having taught 6th grade math for many years, the coputational component was the least creative part of teaching math - and i didn\\'t really enjoy it. i understand that in this context, computational thinking is a more open ended creative way of working through a problem. it is a way of puting something in a process and getting something else out and thinking through the steps of getting the idea from one place to another. from the talk mitch gave today, i understand that it is a new type of literacy that includes \"learning through designing,\" \"building on personal interests\" and \"collaborating creatively.\" -liz\\n\\ni am struck by the idea that computational thinking is a new form of literacy. for me, that is a reminder that consciousness about this kind of thinking is for all.\\n\\ncomputational thinking involves problem-solving. one uses algorithms that he/she already knows to make sense of data that at first might appear random and overwhelming. as we learned this morning, this is a process that includes creating, sharing and reflecting.\\n\\nwhat is computational thinking? my first reaction was that it involved solving problems, math problems, a way of viewing how numbers effected andaffected our lives. my view now is that computational thinking is evolving into a broader environment.\\n\\ncomputational thinking is reflecting then performing activities in a logical order. this morning we saw a demonstration to encourage our students to create book reports, animate objects, create geography learning tools and even conduct science projects and research using scratch.\\n\\nwhen mitch asked us to state our initial thoughts about computational thinking, mine were: thinking logically, planning,mapping out a strategy, cause/effect,animation, data collection and analysis and communicating. after this morning\\'s introduction, tour, and reflections, i find my own thinking incorporating more and changing. one of my school\\'s motto is that we need to stay \"green and growing.\"\\n\\nsites/default/files/computational thinking article.pdf i just found this article on computational thinking that is very interesting. it helped clarify the idea for me. -liz\\n\\ni also first thought of mathmatics, and then computers in a more general sense. i like the idea of learning about some of the computer science concepts, for those of us who do not dwell in the computer/math world as much. i like the problem solving approach and teh emphasis on play and fun. i have always thought that the ways of the old style kindergarten class should be applied to all levels. learn about computational thinking first with hands on activities!\\n\\nso is \"creative computing\" only about scratch? should we take from this workshop a new view of how schools work and how students learn and how interests drive education?\\n\\ncreative computing is definitely not only about scratch. i hope that people were able to imagine new possibilities for learning -- with technology and beyond.\\n\\n\"what does computational thinking mean to you?\" a unique question ?! i will try to answer based on my 25 years with various programming languages and make the following points : 1) trying to anticipate what the software user may do and designing the proper response and then learning from trial and error what should be done to make your software - almost perfect - is a very useful process that teaches the young ones many planning lessons. 2) the value of sticking to good variable names and nice structures in the long run, rather than the instant gratification of quick-and-dirty programming can be demonstrated with ease. 3) the balance between what i call nice/elegant/structured coding and fast accurate answers is usually a very quick lesson in being practical. and much more..\\n\\nkaren what an interesting question you have brought up. i was not at the talk so my response lacks the contextual framework in which your quotation was used. all the same i am fascinated by the term computational. on the one hand it refers to computation. that is something that has been going on for thousands of years. on the other hand the word computer is infused in that adjective today. i don\\'t think you can talk about computational thinking without thinking about the flood of data that exists in the world today. i really like how tim berners-lee talks about it on ted. www.ted.com/talks/tim_berners_lee_on_the_next_web.html ultimately it is up to computers and people thinking computationally to handle this new world order. what better argument can you make to start children learning computer programming at an early age?\\n\\nthe ability

karen randall. (you can check out notes from prior meetings on scratched here, here, and here.) many interesting threads were explored, but one that i thought would be particularly interesting to bring to scratched is around advocacy, as raised by patrice gans. that is, if you\\'re excited about scratch, how do you help others understand that excitement and express what young people get out of participating? one path is to talk with young people and see how they describe about what they\\'re doing:what do the young people you work with say about their scratch experiences? how could those reflections help advocate for scratch?\\n\\nin this conversation, karen made the excellent point that while scratch is a cool thing on its own, its advocacy is about more than introducing students to computer programming. i am wondering if anyone has put together supportive reasearch, summary papers, or proposals in advocating for scratch with district decision makers, including the thinking, creating, and self-motivated learning aspects.  if so, would you be willing to share them here? frank sabat_ explained his success in supporting scratch around barlcelona, spain this way: \"i talk to people.\" at what sorts of organizations, conference or meeting sessions have people shared scratch? where should we as teachers be sure that scratch is on the agenda?\\n\\ni am interested in creating a scratch computer programming advocacy group. i believe it would help when speaking with school officials. perhaps a loosely formed group that believes in promoting computer programming through the use of scratch in the k-12 curriculum. please respond if you are interested. thanks, vicki gold\\n\\nlast week for some unknown reason the department of education in queensland australia blocked the scratch site to students. getting an explanation is impossible but i\\'ll wager a strong message from the scratch team might wake them up. kids i teach in special education are flabbergasted.\\n\\ni am definitely very interested in furthering the goal of promoting computer programming in k-12 education. i would be happy to participate in any advocacy group. i am currently a member of csta(computer science teachers assocation http://csta.acm.org/ ), whoes main goal is to promote the teaching of computer science (in k-12). i am presently running for a position on the board asthe k-8 representative. i believe that computer science, which is at the core of the development of new technologies, should be taught to all students.teaching computer science is essential to the development of critical thinking and problem solving skills. computers are an integral part of life in the 21st century, and our schools have an obligation to prepare our students for the future. traditionally, students are first exposed to computer science in high school as part of an ap computer science class.however, i believe it is extremely important to grab students attention long before their first ap course. consequently, i believe that the age which students are taught critical computer skills is an important issue. it seems that scratch would be the ideal avenue for introducing younger students to basic programming concepts while at the same time igniting their curiosity and imagination. in regards to advocacy, the first step would be to push for legislation that requires computer skills in the k-12 curriculum. a bill had been proposed, the computer science education act (of 2010), http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h111-5929, but did not make past committee.i believe a more united effort is needed for this to come to fruition. lets work together to make this happen for our students and our schools.\\n\\nhi vicki, let\\'s talk! :) patrice\\n\\ninteresting to think about your coments in comparison to the newly elevated profile for engineering in us elementary schools. it is part of our (minnesota) science standards, but we have no state standards for technology or computer science. how did that leaf of the stem (science math engineeering technology) conversation move forward?\\n\\ni feel that scratch is a great way of introducing cs into schools. in scotland the education system has for a good few years now always had some form of computing on the curriculum. until the recent change it was the 5-14 curriculum and this for part had use of logo to teach children about control etc. now there has been a change and the new curriculum still mentions to an extent control but moreso there is a specific cselement of it,which incorporates playing games through to making games http://www.ltscotland.org.uk/learningteachingandassessment/curriculumareas/technologies/eandos/index.asp iam now looking at getting more schools on board with scratch through my phd and primary school children\\'s learning.\\n\\nsince karen randall has decided to end her participation in the monthly scratchplc meetings, patrice gans and i thought this might be the perfect time to see if the group would be interested in taking on more of a community activist role. the group would be comprised of like-minded educators whose goal is to effect change on the grass roots level to promote computer programming in the k-12 curriculum, in after-school programs, and in the home. as a whole, we do not have to be a homogeneous group to be effective; we can come from different perspectives, have different agendas, and have different teaching and learning styles. what we will have in common is a desire to promote the use of scratch as a means by which to facilitate substantive changes to the approach to how we teach 21st century skills. please respond if you are interested. thanks, vicki gold\\n\\nhi vicki i am greatly interested in what you would like to do, bringing scratch to schools is my main interest(see below) amanda :)\\n\\ndisregard - pushed the save button twice.\\n\\nhi, amanda and keith i\\'m sorry i haven\\'t gotten back to you sooner, but with the school term coming to an end i\\'ve been very busy. patrice and i are planning to put a first draft action proposal together for mid-june. if you are interested let\\'s talk before that. tell us when is a good time to skype. thanks, vicki\\n\\nvicki sorry for taking so long to get back been busy getting a paper about scratch fnished for a conference later on this year. i am happy to skype and best time for me is usually around/after 7pm (gmt) as im not sure skype is easily accessible in unviersity. amanda\\n\\n', '13442': 'happily ever after: digital storytelling with scratch building learning communities (blc) pre-conference workshop monday, july 15, 2012 8:30am-12:30pm mit media lab hosted by mitch resnick and karen brennan do you love stories? do you want to learn how to create your own interactive digital stories? in this hands-on session, participants were introduced to scratch, created interactive stories, viewed examples of stories created by young people and heard how scratch is being used by educators for storytelling. characters to contact another participant, click on their name below to leave a comment on their profile. erika bolte amy burvall molly buttitta john egan anne marie fries janet gray-mckennis angelica guerrero mary anne hamilton matthew heard miguel marquez chynel mccrink geetha narayanan larissa perkins siobain perkins brian puerling frank slabaugh mitch resnick karen brennan michelle chung preface as attendees arrived, they received a scratch starter kit and set up their scratch and scratched accounts. installing scratch signing up for a scratch account signing up for a scratched account chapter 1: in character to get started, karen shared examples of scratch projects from the storytelling genre. dinosaur monster mash the lion and the boar day dream alexander the great napoleon participants were then given 10 minutes to dive into scratch, explore, and then share what they discovered. delete the cat import a character import a sound record a sound add a background draw a character in the next activity, participants drew monsters in the style of exquisite corpse. one person drew the top portion, passed it on to the next person who filled in the body, who then passed the drawing onto a third person who finished the bottom part of the monster. check out photos of the \"exquisite characters\" on the scratched flickr page. chapter 2: plot twist!

creative computing has evolved into a new way of looking at the world and using technology to express yourself and solve problems. i originally thought scratch was a tool for teaching computing. i now think it is a way to teach almost anything. my thoughts on creative computing have really changed. this is the first time i\\'ve been shown a path to a philosophy as second nature and extremely relevant simple or complex, multi-dimensional, inspiring, engaging, allows \"winning\", doable scratch is very powerful and can engage all age levels, very good learning experience my idea of computational computing includes many more concepts and ingredients the workshop created a very safe, collaborative environment where i became more creative far more complex. scratch shows few limits and can be used to create so many examples and things. creative computing involves synthesizing various media to communicate ideas. less intimidated i never realized that serious computing skills could be introduced in such a fun, creative way. scratch is a great tool to hook young students, especially female, into further studies in computer science. using computers intelligently in a manner that is healthy and rewarding my perspective has been widened. i knew that before but no one else does at my school, so i need to expand their view. works in progress that are shared, repeat forever: imagine, create, play, share, reflect i designed, created, personalized, collaborated, and reflected (a lot!). freedom, collaboration, problem solving involving everyone, not just us computer instructors awesome! inclusive! exciting! i think about creative computing in the same way i think about making art or other projects. i am very process-oriented but i can be frustrated. working in \"small chunks\" can help me keep things simple. it\\'s for everyone regardless of ability, age, etc! organizational thinking personalization the media lab was an eye opener! wow wow wow (jealous) learning different approaches accessible, concrete, fun, challenging, creative expression, collaborative, experiment when i return to my students, i plan to... i\\'ve already made plans to present to my local ed tech group. i\\'ve also contacted my super about presenting, and i\\'m still here use different exercises use scratch in the computer science classroom and scratch in a meditation i will give and scratch in the math department foster more creativity: offer more choice with projects find more ways to integrate computers and scratch into existing curriculum scratch has a much wider use than i first thought so i need to get other teachers involved and excited get them creating and producing with scratch use scratch with my students, along with the other \"stuff\" in the class revise lessons, chunk learning, break parts into manageable activities introduce the students to the connection between scratch and robotics design-based learning is a great new approach for my room. reflect is so important! create a project notebook i am excited to take scratch back to my school and use with my middle school students. the resources will help guide me. use the scratch cards as \"mini-lessons\" within the sixth grade choice-based program i look forward to seeing how my kinds\\' input will change the way i approach things. i will load scratch and start using it in my fourth grade class. i plan to incorporate the creative design model into my classroom. i\\'m bringing back new teaching methods for my work with teachers as well as with students. i plan to use scratch in the beginning of the cs classes to aid in describing oop. scratch scratch scratch!

any other thoughts? i appreciate any insight you can provide. thanks a lot!\\n\\nhi, i teach in a middle school computer lab in nm. i have taught introduction to programming for many years using logo. last year was my first foray into teaching scratch. this year, i am developing a nine week moodle course that can be used as a blended, (some are now saying hybrid), course or strictly online. i am a certified blackboard teacher for the state, but i like developing courses for moodle as that is what i am used to. instruction is guided by the csta's, (computer science teachers' association), recommendations for introducing programming to the middle school, focusing on algrorithms and problem solving, (while keeping it interesting to my students). my course is developed around my state's math standards, programming employment standards, and nets from iste. students will work through a series of pbl lessons and then develop their own pbl. scratch goes well with labs like mine as an introduction to the career of programming. it would also fit well into math, language arts, and social studies, (many projects are story telling). in hs, given more structure than i use, it would be an excellent introduction into a career track. in elementary, it would be a good introduction to logic. it lacks some of the development for science that starlogo tng has, (see project guts, i am an after school club leader). because of my experience conducting a scratch webinar, i think there will be a group of teachers at each school that could see how scratch could fit into the curriculum. i hope to present my course to our nm iste's conference this spring. training for teachers could be done in a one day workshop, providing there was other support such as a wiki, online environment, etc. wiki's are great for developing curriculum. once students have the basics of using scratch, its best to turn them loose developing their own projects within a framework the instructor has developed. basic projects can be suggested to them, but the instructor needs to become the help desk. issues for use of scratch: would have to be installed on computers using it headsets w/microphones would be a plus quality internet connection required so students/educators could view projects online making sure that the video tutorials are not blocked, etc. suggested curriculum uses for scratch would have to be developed for your state's standards i have collected a great set of references and help sites as a matter of developing my course, if you, or someone from the group you are working with wants to know more, let me know. carl bogardus twitter: weemooseus\\n\\nit's great to hear about your interest in using scratch in classroom activities in illinois. italked about scratch at the illinois computing educators (ice) conference a couple years ago, and i met lots of teachers doing creative work with scratch. you might be able to contact some of them through the ice ning. we've seen scratch used in many different ways in classrooms. of course, it is used in some computer-science and information-technology classes. i'm personally most interested in examples where scratch is integrated into other curriculum areas. we've seen students use scratch to create reports for social-studies classes, simulations for science classes, and interactive stories for english classes. as students create and share projects in scratch, they can learn to think creatively, reason systematically, and work collaboratively -- in addition to becoming more actively engaged with particular curriculum content. if you decide you want to learn more about scratch, you might consider coming to our scratch@mit conference in august. best of luck with your efforts. mitch resnick, mit scratch team\\n\\n\", '25535': 'hey guys, if you are writing a program in scratch, or even javascript, this is the place for you! if you ever need any help a bug-filled project, just leave a discription of what you want down below, and a link to the project... and ill show you what to fix :d see you later! -cukee8\\n\\n', '11848': \"the weekly roundup is where the scratched team shares some of the major -- as well as some of the overlooked -- news, stories, and events related to scratch that took place throughout the week. scratched weekly roundup 02/04/12 - 02/10/12 have you submitted a proposal for thescratch@mit conferencetaking placethis july at mit?

what approach(es) to introducing scratch have you already been using?\\n\\napproaches? they are pretty \"ad hoc\". i realize there is guidance in some of the scratch material. i was introduced to scratch mostlyat a media lab open house when i worked for france telecom/orange labs. i had tried a small amount of scratch with my son noah at home when he was seven. it was sort of an alternate activityto bedtime reading. but now, on sort of a volunteer basis, i am the computer teacher at wayland academy of framingham ( http://waylandacademy.org ) and have also inherited care of the website, which needs help. since i work at several other jobs and have five older children as well, my time is really limited. so each of the two days i teach in a week seems to come up suddenly. i have three classes: k-1 (10 students), 2-3 (8 students), 4-5 (6 students). no one else at the school had heard of scratch (except for one other student, it turned out), but they trust me a fair amount to create the computer curriculum as needed, so for 2010 i deceided to do scratch perhaps about half the time with 2-3 and 4-5. (k-1 seemed a bit young, but i figured they might later be an interesting audience for the other classes.) each class is only 30 minutes, so i did: 1st class) talk in general about scratch and get everyone signed in. (that\\'s still not quite done due to some absentees, but i am straightening it out myself as needed.) considering the anonymity and my need to be able to easily work interactively with everyone, i had everyone use their real first name and \"waof\" (for wayland academy of framingham) for their last name. thus, i am \"bruce waof\".we all have different first names fortunately. we all are set up initially with the same password. i let them change certain details if they were still nervous about security. some wanted to live in africa, but i thought that was a bit much. 2nd class) i used my overhead projector. (just using that in the lab creates a bit of mystique fortunately.) for the 2-3 class, i did scratch myself for the whole session. it was fun. i pointed out the cat and the eight groups of commands on the left. i took requests. \"what should the cat do next?\" i did a lot in immediate mode. then i put things in a loop with the \"forever\" construct and soon the cat was bouncing off the walls and making noise. we added a few more sprites. i did some weird vocalization.we ended up with this (hey): http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/brucewaof/854937 with the 4-5 group, i did similar for the first 15 minutes and let them do their own stuff for the last 15 minutes because they were raring to go.in fact, some were trying to duplicate on their own computers what i was doing overhead though i had asked them to just watch.(normally they are trying to play games or do other things, but this was very different.)at one point, i was showing the recording feature.this time, i asked them all to make a sound, but nothing that would upset the parents.somewhere along the line, we had this (crazyanimals): http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/brucewaof/857170 as you can see, they asked to play with images more.then they were off doing their own things.a few finished a simple project that day and uploaded it. it was a very exhilarating day for me, as have been all the sessions so far with scratch.it felt like one of the sessions in \"glee\", if you have watched that show.it went so well, you almost wondered if it was choreographed. 3rd class)i had the students explore scratch or do projects as they chose.here are some of the projects that resulted: http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/alexwaof/844717 (dictionary ball by alex waof) http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/adamwaof/844730 (b, o and b by adam waof) http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/mahimawaof/844721 (dragon torture kitty by mahima waof) http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/jonnywaof/844718 (running player by jonny waof) http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/tesswaof/857484 (tess project by tess waof) http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/artemiswaof/844724 ( aaaahhhhcocococococ!!!!!!! by artemis waof) 4th class) i\\'ve had a fourth class with 2-3, in which i showed these demo projects i had made: http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/brucewaof/854603 (spinning cat and fish) http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/brucewaof/854780 (catandbutterfly) http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/brucewaof/854782 (catandbutterflyandstar) http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/brucewaof/854784 (drawing cat) i showed them how one could download someone else\\'s project and do their own version by modifying this one from the 4-5 class using the 2-3 class\\'s suggestions: http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/alexwaof/845522 (costume changer by alex waof, a student) http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/brucewaof/854881 (changing colors, my slightly modified version) i also showed them this one, which i had found from the 4-5 class.(it\\'s a bit like the flash game hit \"red ball 2\".it has four levels, obstacles, etc.i really didn\\'t know what to say.): http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/alexwaof/849618 (ball game by alex waof) thenwe did more independent exploration, but 4-5 was scheduled for a field trip.however, one of the 4-5 graders asked if he could meet with me at 9am to talk about scratch before he went on the field trip.unfortunately, that is right in the middle of my k-1 class. and that\\'s the story up to now. not too much detail, i hope. i\\'d like to hear more of the experience of others in the classroom. where i teach is a pretty neat school to begin with, but it has still been a surprise to see how the students have taken to scratch so far. bruce\\n\\n', '24366': \"hi i'm new to this board and to scratch. i'm very much interested in teaching kids scratch. i watched the video on one hour coding and tried it for the first time. i also installed the program and read some documentation. i was wondering if it was possible to do the same as one hour coding, that is explain scratch with videos and allow kids to program directly within the browser (ta the same time and in the same window). i find this prresentation very convenient for kids to learn and progress rapidly... i was thinking maybe integrate it on my website. can i do that?

3. intermediate breakout i really enjoyed the intermediate breakout session. we sat around and discussed a wide range of topics: debugging, remixing, broadcasting, and more. for debugging, we spent some time discussing whatdebugging is and strategies for debugging. here\\'s a list of strategies that we developed in the course of our discussion (which involved looking at debugging activities, talking about our own experiences, and trying debug a student\\'s project): use storyboards to think about the steps that would be involved talk through goals and approach explain to someone else what you want to have happen peer editing being incremental testing in a modular way examine how different stacks of code get started print out the scripts to see them side by side put \"markers\" in the code, debugging flag think about properties of the tool (e.g. rotation, costume center) annotate your work with comments single stepping (\"start single stepping\" under theeditmenu,which highlights what blocks are being run) for remixing (taking someone else\\'s project, changing it, and sharing the modified -- or \"remixed\" -- version), we looked at remixes of a project \"for the people of japan\". under any remixed project, there\\'s a count of the remixes, which is a link to a visualization of the remixes, like this one. 4. future events there are lots of ways to keep participating in scratched professional development: hang out on scratched come to the monthly meetups- register for next month\\'s meetup and be notified about future events through the quarterly newsletter. attend the monthly webinars- the next webinar is all about computational concepts and is taking place on monday, march 28 at 7pm est. more hands-on scratch - i\\'ll be facilitating a hands-on scratch workshop this thursday from 1pm to 5pm at the ica, if you\\'re interested in getting more scratch practice. 5. what\\'s next?

i noticed that the csv file upload has a limit of 50. thank you scratch team! you are all heroes!\\n\\nthank you, thank, you, thank you!\\n\\nhi bradley! nope, there is no limit to the number of students that can be assigned to a class. :)\\n\\nso excited about teacher accounts! yay! i have a quick question...once i\\'ve set up each class, and added my students, how do they log in? do they sign in with my teacher username and password? also, i set up a test student to try to figure this out myself...how can i delete that test student? thank you!\\n\\nhi karen. good questions! the password for student accounts depends on how you created their accounts. did you use a csv, email link, or create the accounts one at a time? if you used a csv then you predetermined their password when you created the accounts. if you used the email link, then students create their own password by following the link. if you created the accounts one by one, then the password is your teacher account username (they will be prompted to change this after logging in for the first time). in order to delete the test account, you will need to sign into that account and delete it through the account settings menu. we have created a teacher account faq page as well as avideo about teacher accounts that i think might be helpful in answering some of your questions :) i hope this helps!\\n\\nperfect, thank you so much!\\n\\nhi christan, i would lik to provide the traditional chinese subtitle for the \"video about teacher accounts\". youtube can antomatically gernerate aenglish .srt file may i have the english .srt file so that i can do the transaltion? yh.\\n\\ni\\'ve been trying to test adding in a student account from the email link, but any username i try using has already been taken according to the error message that gets generated. the only thing that\\'s worked is the csv import. i\\'m also unclear about the accessibility of the student account: if i close a class, does the student account that is created become unusable to the student? is the workflow to get them to createa personal scratch account and transfer the work done from the teacher created student account, to their new personal account?\\n\\nnew ot scratch and scratched. have my class set up, kids are coding so life is good. however, is there a way for me to see their work easily? is this what the studio function is for? am i missing a help file or video on this topic. i watched the intro video which was helpful, but when he created the sample \"studio\" he really didn\\'t explain its function. i appologize if i have missed this post or instruction. thank you!\\n\\nsetting up the student accounts for my classrooms. i just accidently added a group of students with a .csv upload to the wrong classroom. there appears to be no way to manually move them across to their correct classroom and i am unable to delete their accounts. any suggestions to get the moved into their correct classroom and out of the \"test\" classroom? i\\'m probably just going to rename test to grade 8 but for my own information is there a way to move a student or do they have the option to leave a classroom and then join another?\\n\\ni am having trouble figuring out how these teacher accounts work. i added a student to a test class using a generated link and it says that student in the class. if i heard right, i have to make all of the kids in my class curators in order to see all of their work in one place. i don\\'t really understand what that means, but i tried to do that with my test student by clicking invite curators and selecting that student and clicking add but a message shows up saying that only members of the class can be curators. this person is already in the class but can\\'t be added as a curator. i\\'m trying to figure out what the benefit is to using a teacher account versus just having the kids make accounts and share links with me. i thought these accounts would be easier to navigate and allow a teacher to give a course code or link to students who would then enroll in the class and all projects that students created would appear in that classroom. it seems there is an awful lot of set up required to get this working and i\\'m having trouble figuring it all out. i have many new students to scratch and they are not happy about being forced to share their very beginner work with the universe. i get the whole share with all thing but there should be occasions that teachers (especially of younger students) should be afforded the option to wall off their classes so kids are free to learn and experiment without doing it in public.\\n\\nhi ann! thanks for the post. scratch teacher accounts are new, and our team is still working out the kinks - thanks to comments from people like yourself! regarding your question about studios, all student accounts created within a class will automatically be added as curators for any studios created in that class. we have noticed a 10-15 minute delay in seeing these student accounts appear in the curator section of the class; perhaps this is what happened during your test? when we built student accounts, we made the decision to align these accounts with regular scratcher accounts in many ways, including their relationship to the greater community. this was because we have seen time and again the importance of the community in supporting and encouraging scratchers to keep coding. that said, we also understand your concerns about sharing publicly on scratch. keep in mind that you can always choose to use the offline version of scratch instead, which removes the online community entirely from the equation. thank you again for sharing your thoughts. hopefully i have provided a bit of insight into how these accounts work, and why we built them that way. we welcome any other feedback you may have.\\n\\nhi i think the teacher accounts are great and have set up my class. although i used a csv file to set up username and passwords, the students still had to complete their personal info (age, gender, country etc) themselves. is it possible for me to include this in the csv so that they skip this step? thank you!\\n\\ni have the same issue in that i don\\'t want my students\\' work to be visible to the entire community due to their age, lack of parental approval, and privacy. i also have an additional constraint that students are using chromebooks and therefore cannot use the offline version. i have found a potential solution. i came across a scatch x version of scratch that is not supported by scratch but has been working so far. it has the same look and all of the features of the on-line scratch account with the addition of an extension for the finch robot. the benefits are that 1) it can be used on-line without an account, 2) the students can use it on a chromebook 3) the students can save their work directly to google drive. they can then submit their work to me via google classroom or, if you are not using google classroom, they could share the file with you. i have not yet tested having to grade all of these but i think it might not be a problem if i download the off-line editor on my mac. if a student wants to share their work with the community, and gets their parents\\' permission to create an online scratch account, they can always upload their scratch program to that account. good luck!\\n\\nif you go tohttps://scratch.mit.edu/projects/editor/ you can use the file / download to your computer to save work without an account and file / upload from your computer to load saved work from your computer. when you are on a chromebook, this will use google drive for where things are saved. this lets you use the scratch2.0 editor to create projects.\\n\\nhi chris!thanks for the question. currently, it is not possible to include this information in the csv file during account creation. i will pass along your suggestion as something to consider as we continue iterating and improving upon scratch teacher accounts. :)\\n\\ni tried to sign up for a teacher account last night but never received a confirmation email. i am using the same email address that i used for my personal account. could that be the problem? is there any way to change my personal account into a teacher account? meg franks\\n\\nhi meg. if you email help@scratch.mit.edu, i can help you there (i don\\'t want to ask you for the verification details here since we ask for that stuff to stay private on scratch). in the email you send, please provide the username and email address of the teacher account you created. thanks! :)\\n\\nthanks for the chromebook info vicky! we continue to use the offline version on our mac laptops, but this is good to know for our chromebooks. i\\'m still patiently waiting for a google sign-on option :)\\n\\nhow do i quickly and easily sign into my teacher account? i have one, it has been verified, but i keep getting kicked to the regular scratch ed account. please help.\\n\\nhi jessie! in order to help, i will need a bit more information. since i do not want to ask for account information publicly, will you send a message to help@scratch.mit.edu with your scratch teacher account username and the email address associated with the account. i can help you there. thanks!\\n\\nhi paula, another option you might like to try is itch. we host our own version of scratch. we keep all your students projects visible for commenting only to your class. as an added benefit, we provide support for submitting projects to the teacher for grading with rubrics in our learning management system.\\n\\nremoving a student from a class. a number of students have been added to the wrong class. i would like to \"eject\" them from the current class and add them to the other. i don\\'t want to delete the student, just remove them from the class panel.\\n\\ni have registered and been accepted for a scratch teacher account, but i cant see where to create and manage a class. i would appreciate some help. i\\'m not even sure which url i should be using:https://scratch.mit.edu/educators/ orhttp://scratched.gse.harvard.edu/ please confirm url and path to create a class. thanks, linda\\n\\nhi george. currently, it is not possible to move students from one class to another. you will need to create a new account for those students. apologies for the inconvenience.\\n\\nhi linda. scratch teacher accounts are created and found on scratch.mit.edu. when you created your account did you do this through the teacher account registration process on this page? if not, you may have created a regular scratch account instead of a teacher account which would explain why you are unable to see the teacher account features. if you are comfortable sharing your scratch username here, i may be able to check on the status of the account for you. if not, that\\'s totally fine. you can always send a message to help@scratch.mit.edu and i can help you there. have you seen the teacher account faq video we created yet? i think it may be help answer a lot of the questions you have. you can find that video here:https://scratch.mit.edu/educators/faq\\n\\nhi christan, yes, i did register on the teacher page, with the username lindawollan, and received two emails back. the first confirmed that \\'your application for an account is currently being reviewed. any accountapplications that are not from teachers/educators will not be approved\\'.the second email said\\'your scratched account for lindawollan has been approved\\'. i then followed the links and changed passwords, etc. i can sign into bothhttps://scratch.mit.edu/ andhttp://scratched.gse.harvard.edu/ but nowhere do i see the purple bannerthat has the my classes, educator resources and teacher account faq buttons on it. i tried emailing scratch@mit.edu, but received an email back saying that they are \\'very busy, so were not able to respond to all the messages we receive\\' - i assume that\\'s an auto-reply :) would you please check my account to see whether i have the appropriate access? i would appreciate it. thanks, linda\\n\\nhi linda, scratched accounts (which is the account you are using here) are different from scratch teacher accounts (which are found on scratch.mit.edu). sorry if this is confusing! it looks like the account \"lindawollan\" was created six months ago - we had not released teachers account when you created this so it is a regular scratch account, not a teacher account. might you have created another account using a different username? (the username can be found in the emails that you received.)if not, that\\'s okay. you can make a teacher account here:https://scratch.mit.edu/educators/register i hope this helps! thanks, christan\\n\\nthe scratched team, with help from the amazing christan balch,will behosting a twitter chat on teacher accounts this coming monday, october 24 at 7pm est. we hope you\\'ll join us for the discussion! willa, on behalf of the scratched team\\n\\nhas anyone had a student try to upload a project made on a raspberry pi (using scratch 1.4) to their student account? i have a student who tried this week and he got an error message saying \"unknown user\". last year, my students who had their own traditional scratch accounts were able to successfully upload from the pi. thanks!\\n\\nthanks christan. i assumed that the account i created 6 months ago, was a teacher account, as it had to be approved with all my teacher details given. i have now created another account giving all the same credentials - unfortunately i had to use a different user name, which is even more confusing, as i now have two accounts :( i\\'m now waiting again to be accepted as a teacher, so i can get going.\\n\\nthanks for the quick reply.. is there anyway to remove the accounts from the class listthat are not needed? this will become a bit confusing.\\n\\nhi george.currently, there is no way to quickly delete or edit the account from within the teacher account. the deletion menu is within the student account, so you must first log in with the student (or log in yourself, if you\\'ve created the account in error), and navigate from the top-right dropdown: account settings > account > \"i want to delete my account\". i hope this helps!\\n\\nfollowing up on the raspberry pi issue, we did finally get projects from pi to upload to students accounts. user error suspected. cheers.\\n\\nglad to hear you were able to upload to student accounts :) have a good day!\\n\\nhi christan, i am just getting ready to start using scratch again with my students this year. i have two accounts--my origianl account(mestech) i used for years with my students before teacher accounts. this account has lots of resources, studios and projects that i want to still use with my students. i also have alpha teacher account that i used last school year with my students. what i would like to do, is convert my original account to a teacher account and combine it with my alpha teacher account. i do not want to keep my alpha user name as it was the genericscratchteacheralpha029 username. i would like to keep my original username, mestech. when i was at the conference this year, i spoke to someone regarding this and was told all i needed to do was to send an email and this could be done. unfortunately, i can not find the email address  i only see on the scratch site where i can request a new account. can you help me or direct me to who i should contact. thanks!\\n\\nhi sandy. thanks for reaching out! we actually do not have the ability to combine scratch accounts, but id be happy to convert your regular account into a teacher account for you though. please send a message to teacher-accounts@scratch.mit.eduwith your regular account username and the email address associated with your account and we can help you there. thanks!\\n\\ni have a question about studios and student accounts. is there a way to share one studio across multiple classes? thank you!\\n\\ni am revisiting scratch with its new teacher functions and am also getting started with cs first. i recently set up my first class of students with a studio in scratch but have yet to start with the students. i have also recently created my first club in cs first intended for the same class of students. can anyone advise on the pros and cons of using each independently? can i have the students follow the activities in cs and login to the new scratch studio account so i can take advantage of the new features of scratch? or is it better to simply have them log into the scratch account created in cs first? any advice is appreciated.\\n\\ni am facing the same dilemma. i inquired on the google side also. it would be great if you could use one account on both platforms.\\n\\n... or, using any existing account to join a class. students shouldn\\'t need to create new accounts to join a class.\\n\\nhi, i have a teacher account for teachernorfleet, but do not see where i can set up my classes.\\n\\nhi, did you open the url on the confirmation mail? i remember just same problem happened on me.\\n\\nhi! i teach teachers how to use scratch and other resources, so i though teachers account will be great! however, i have many doubts: - students accounts only work within the class? can they just enter and do their projects independently? - can teachers track changes on the projects? or are there any function that allow some following up? - i usually teach how to create and studio, invite students to create they accounts and later became curators, so all projects witihin a class can be part of the same studio. taking this? what are the extra benefits of having a teacher account? - i read here in the comments something about csv to create students accounts? no idea what that is. thanks in advance!!!\\n\\nhi there! it looks like you have created a regular scratch account rather than a teacher account. you can create a teacher account here:https://scratch.mit.edu/educators/#teacher-accounts i hope this helps!\\n\\nhi natalia, students accounts only work within the class? can they just enter and do their projects independently? i\\'m not sure i understand your question. might you please elaborate on what you mean by this? can teachers track changes on the projects? or are there any function that allow some following up? no, there are no tools in scratch that would allow you to track changes on a project. i usually teach how to create and studio, invite students to create they accounts and later became curators, so all projects witihin a class can be part of the same studio. taking this? students are automatically added as curators to studios created within a classroom. this allows you to bypass the step of inviting students to curate studios. what are the extra benefits of having a teacher account?i read here in the comments something about csv to create students accounts? no idea what that is. i would encourage you to check out our teacher account faq page as well as the introductory video we\\'ve created on teacher accounts (found on the same page) as i think it might be helpful in answering some of your questions. i hope this helps, christan\\n\\nhi, @christan balch i love the teacher account, this will allow me to come back to scratch. is there an easy way for students to migrate projects they created in a regular scratch account to a teacher managed account?\\n\\nhi, @christan balch i love the teacher account, this will allow me to come back to scratch. is there an easy way for students to migrate projects they created in a regular scratch account to a teacher managed account?\\n\\nhi there! there are a couple ways your students might migrate their projects from a regular account to a student account.the first way would be to download their projects from the regular account and then re-upload them into their newly created student account. alternatively _ and perhaps easier _ they can make use of scratch\\'s remix feature and remix their projects from their regular account to the new student account. remixes will be saved even if the original project is deleted. i hope this helps!\\n\\nin creative computing learner workbook we have reflections can someone send the sample answers for those reflections, my students want to compare the answers. my mail id is maruthi.yerra@cdconcordia.com\\n\\nhi @ christan blach. i need ansswers for reflection prompts in creative computing learner workbook for all 7 units.\\n\\nhi maruthi yerra, answers are not available for the creative computing guide.\\n\\nhow do i create my classroom. i use code.org and codehs, but scratch seems too busy and not easy to find where and how to create a classroom to start using it. thanks\\n\\nhi aneck! i would encourage you to check out our teacher account faq page as well as watch the introductory video we have shared there. i think it may be helpful in answering your question :)\\n\\nhi bradley, it looks like nobody ever answered your question, but i sure wish they had, because i also would like to know if it\\'s possible to share one studio across multiple classes. have you ever found an answer to your question?\\n\\nhi christan, i appreciate that i\\'m replying to a reply that you wrote almost 2 years ago, so apologies if what i\\'m asking doesn\\'t take account of more up-to-date information. i have the same problem as george - i want to move students from one class to another. i don\\'t want to have to go through the tedious process of deleting students\\' accounts, then creating new accounts, with new usernames, for every student, just so i can re-organize the classes that they are all in. from now on, i plan to only create scratch classes that will be named according to graduation year, so students will just stay in that same class as they move from one year level to the next. but that doesn\\'t solve the problem of those students who are still enrolled in last year\\'s class. i want to tidy things up, but don\\'t want to have to spend lots of time deleting and re-creating student accounts, and confusing students who already have enough trouble remembering current usernames and passwords, without giving them a new one, or chasing up student to get them to delete their own accounts etc. etc. i\\'ve used a number of different online platforms for students over the years, and have never encountered one where account management is as cumbersome as it is on scratch. i\\'m tempted to just go back to using the offline version of scratch, which is what i did for years before scratch teacher accounts became available. but the kids love being able to explore other scratchers creations, getting inspiration, re-mixing and so on. please, is there anything that can be done about this??\\n\\nhi, i use the teacher account and have some classes in this 2 years. so, it is one of greatest function of scratch! but i don\\'t understand for some problems. 1. why can anybody still send comments to the project in closed class? after class closed, the student can\\'t sign-in, answer to the comment, or control the thread. it seems unfair or sometime danger, isn\\'t it? 2. why the students accounts named in global? the teacher have to make so many global username, or usual \"school-year-class-numbering\" name. how was the architecture for the identificationby the special delimiter? (ex. name.class) 3. at first, student and teachers talk each other in comment, only in the scratch class, not in global. especially low grade, it difficult to take care to access to the global sns. thank you!\\n\\nhello, i may have hit the limit on the number of students that i can add to a class. is this documented or can someone tell me? thanks, kelly powers\\n\\nhi kelly! how many students have you added to the class? i wonder whether this question may be better directed toward the teacher accounts email: teacher-accounts@scratch.mit.edu, or the teaching with scratch facebook group where we\\'ve migrated many of our discussions. i think you\\'ll get more helpful feedback from those sources! best, alexa\\n\\nhi alexa, i\\'ll send an email. i have 259 students and it seems to have maxed out at 250. kelly\\n\\nhello! i teach scratch in a school. i lecture 5 classes on daily basis. each class attend the scratch for 35 minutes which, to me, personally, doesn\\'t seems to be enough for such kind of activities. meanwhile administration cannot allow me to engage every group more than 35 minutes as other teacher have to teach as well. so my question is how should i manage my lecture, curricullum and activities and all sorts of things to get most out of my students with the 35 minute integration in computer lab. it is a big challenge for me. can anyone help me sort out

year high school mathematics teacher. i am planning tointroduce my students to scratch. are there any suggestions for lesson plans. what should i expect.is there any general advice for a first year teacher wanting to introduce scratch programming?\\n\\ni have used scratch in my seventh grade pre-algebra class, a different level than what you are trying but maybe this will be helpful anyway. have fun! i looked at the topics in the required curriculum and asked myself where using scratch would enhance student learned of specific concepts. i chose three areas for the kids to make their own projects and a few others where a demonstration project made by me would help in the teaching. 1. coordinate geometry: project was to make their initials using only pen and \"go to x, y\" commands. first they did this in quadrant one, then they had to draw three more sets of initials in the other quadrants, same distance from the x,y axis as the first ones. it was very hard for some of the kids to do the transfer, and told me a lot about their visual/spatial understanding. http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/room209/321638 2. similarity: project was to make a very simple quadrilateral-based character, then use a formula to enlarge or shrink it. they made variables with sliders to show that if you only mess with one coordinate, the image is not similar to the orginal. http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/exposchool/867742 3. geometry terms: the geometry at this level included lots of vocabulary, so i had the kids make a scratch dictionary defining some of the terms and

of money the project will need. in addition to the hardware, we will need to pay the aba/sped person for his great app idea. personally, in the design i am more excited that the kids will get to

most of the children like scratch - average of 80% were happy with the lessons with the rest finding them ok and only once did i get a child not liking a lesson - though that turned out to be more of a sharing computer issue than not actually liking scratch. i have worked with a good mix of academic abilites and cant say that there is any one particular type of student that scratch works well - from children with behavioural problems to talented maths children there is always something to suit them in scratch (ages 7-12). yes there are differences in what they may have produced but for enjoyment and learning still the same. the scratch cards are a definite to start off with as its the best introduction as to what scratch can offer. the only problems i ever had were technological ones, always handy to have scratch on a usb drive just in case. amanda\\n\\nthanks,amanda. that is good to hear!\\n\\ncarol, couple of things that have worked for me. 1) there are certain kids who \"get it\" quicker than others and when they finish early these kid can be used to help/teach others. also, it doesn\\'t always have to the ones who \"get it\" quicker, its especially gratifying if you can find one child of low self-esteem and find a way that they can teach other kids something new. it is great when you can have the kids be the teachers.  the guiding principle i try (and often fail) to use is let the kids be the teachers. this has its limits and you can\\'t expect kids to learn everything themselves, but there are opportunities for it to happen and ideally you can help orchestrate it happening. 2) during my classes many kids will be working independently on different parts of their project and i need a way to get their attention when one of them does something \"cool\" that i want to point out (and name the behavior idea) for the rest of the class. i generally hate to yell to get their attention, so i developed a technique where i simply clap (in some short rhythm). at firs tthe kids may look then ignore it, but i repeat (not saying a word) until all the kids look at me and start to repeat the clap. i will visually (and in some cases verbally with as few words as possible) encourage them to repeat my rhthym. they usually get it and when they repat i tell them what a great thing did and tell them why it was great and name the powerful idea. 3) at the beginning of a set of \"classes\" i will encourage them to make mistakes.ithink the culture of the class plays a very important role in learning. one of the first things i do when teaching (school or sports) a new group of kids is to encourage them to make mistakes and how to handle them. a couple of phrases i use are: if you aren\\'t making mistakes, you aren\\'t trying hard enough. congratulations you made a mistake, now what can we learn from it? learn from the mistakes of others, you don\\'t have enough time to make them all yourself. i also tend to model mistake making (sometimes intentionally :) in dealing mistakes i use the bathroom analogy (stolen frompca,nytimes articlehere, on flushing mistakes and filling their emotional tanks, which is equally important). 4) i sometimes find kids doing something completly different from what i had intended. in my bad moments i will try and correct them. i had one kid who was laughing histically and doing something related to the task at hand, but far from the intended task. at first i tried to \"nudge\" him back on task. this was a mistake, which i fortunately realized quickly and the kid fortunatly ignored me and did what was fun and motivating for him (and he was learning and doing cool new things which the other kids saw).\\n\\nhi stephen, thanks for your ideas, especially the point about making mistakes.very important, but ihadn\\'t thought about explicitly teaching that. we will now! carol\\n\\n', '37518': 'the second cambridge, ma scratched meetup of the year is happening on november 7. meet up with us

putting it up on a moodle server. over all, i am very pleased with the organization of the unit and how easily most of it is going into the unit. as far as i know, this is going to be the first programming unit, in our state, developed for middle schools to use as a blended course. if i can adapt the course to our state\\'s online course standards, it could become available state-wide. so, again, i want to give my congrats to the scratched team - excellent work! off i go to create rubrics for my grade level!\\n\\nwe are moving into session #6 now, and still finishing up our dance party projects. my middle school students meet for 40 minutes, three times weekly. i am finding that we need to spend a little more time on each session than i originally thought that we would-the students are interested in creating very ambitious projects already! we are using the resource cards, susan\\'s youtube channel, and projects from the web site for guidance. i have been videotaping their sessions and then playing the films back to the other classes so different grades can view the projects being created in other classes. this is one way they are learning from each other and collaborating, even thouugh they may not all be meeting face-to-face. i also pull up specific projects in progress from other classes so students can see the scripts, etc. that other students are working out. the students in class are encouraged to travel around the room to offer help and view others\\' projects also. the reflection questions are something i really appreciate about this curriculum, and the maintenance of the design notebook. we usually close reflection time with a discussion/sharing session. my students struggled with the idea of sketching the arts- themed project. this was a good thing:they produced some great ideas! i had planned to integrate portions of the calder curriculum into my plans with this, but so far i am sticking to the draft as written, and the students are learning so much with it. thank you for providing this!\\n\\nhi b, it\\'s nice how you\\'re supporting collaboration within and across classes. the videotaping is a strategy i haven\\'t

class meets 3 times a week for approximately 45 minutes. we started doing scratch week 10 and this week is week 23. we finished our dance parties but that made us want to spend some time on audio

we\\'re back. we\\'d love to share. anyone up for a skype conference? we had fun with ms. pickett\\'s class! anyone doing anything similar with audio and scratch?\\n\\ni am getting ready to train some

cornell notes. so i have completed a cornell notes template for each \"module\", (intro, arts, etc.). as we have shorter periods, i have had to limit the responses to one note taking per module. i have put all of the design questions and the vocabulary, (cornell notes calls them key words), on each template. so each student has to turn in the project for the module and then complete the notes. at the same time we are learning scratch, students are learning to put their materials online in blackboard, same ideas would apply to other online environments.\\n\\nwe will be taking a short break in the curriculum to learn to use audacity, (its free). then we will be ready to work on our final projects. students love adding sounds and music to projects.\\n\\nwe wanted to do audio too so we did the interactive band project. my students are loving it! would you be interested in doing that and we could share them?\\n\\nteam, this draft is proving very successful in my middle school. my students are thinking and learning, and i am so appreciative of the materials you have provided. the students are growing in self-confidence and many are getting turned on to computer science. my question is, will there be an extension of this curriculum guide? ihave some \"eager beavers\" in 6th and 7thgrade who want to keep delving more deeply with scratch, and i have been so pleased with the implementation of this in our school that i want to continue challenging the studentsnext year. i\\'m planning to introduce picoboardsas an extension, but am wondring if you could point me towards some additional curricular resources for teaching scratch. essentially, i am good at implementing, but not so great at creating my own materials :) thanks for any feedback you can provide.-betty p.\\n\\nthanks so much for the feedback! currently, there isn\\'t an extended version of the guide although there are hopes to develop strategies for this in the future. exactly how to do this? we\\'re not sure yet. do you have any suggestions? for your 6th and 7th graders, i might suggest thescratch programming challengesor design studio activities that i could imagine being formatted for a classroom lesson plan. every few weeks, the scratch teamalso posts a new design studio prompt on the scratch website(see the 4th post on the right column), so if you are able to access the website, that might be a way to engage the students with a wider audience. if you\\'re interested in physical computing like the picoboards, the lego wedo robotics kitis anotherphysical extension that works with scratch. you could also look through the middle school resources on scratched to see if there\\'s anything of interest there. hope that helps. let us know how it goes! m\\n\\nthanks so much for providing this outstanding curriculum guide to me and my students.we have had afewbumpsalong the way and i know you are interested in how this currculum is working out for students, so i thought iwould share the few challenges we encountered: my groups have made it through to session #12 so far. things have goneextremely well until we attempted the scrolling starter project. this one has proved the most challenging task for my students so far, and the one with which they have encounteredthe most difficulties.many (6-8) students were not able to independently follow the the handout very well on their own, so ibroke it down for them into sequential steps. the steps to creating the program were obvious to me, but they hada littletrouble following the handout on their own, and envisioning the end result. i searched the web site for some scrolling examples, which helped the students understand precisely what the goal of the project was and that helped them understand the four frames displayed at the top of the handout, as well as the other visuals on the handout. there was some confusion over the creation of the 2 sprites with identical costumes, and then some students incorrectly coded their scripts. these problems were easily solved. however, even when all scripts seemed perfectly written, the costumesduplicated exactly, etc..,  we found that on some programs, thescrollingwas \"buggy.\"on thesebuggyprograms,the studentsfigured out that the order in which the variables and operator blocks are added to the stage script impacts the operation of the program.the script can \"look\" correct but not be sequenced correctly, and this is not obvious to the students when visually scanning for errors. having these students rebuild the last two blocks on the stage script precisely from left to right seems to solve the scrolling problem for most. with more experience withscratch, i might have been better able to advise them on this issue, but i was equally stumped for a while trying to figure out why some programs scrolled perfectly and others did not... again, thank you. the \"bumps\" are looked upon as learning opportunities and not frustrations. -bp\\n\\nhi bp, thanks again for sharing this and i\\'m glad to hear that the you were able to resolve the \"bumps\". the scrolling project can definitely be challenging although still popular, and i can see where the handout might be lacking in terms of trying to translate the process of scrolling. this is great feedback for thinking about future iterations of the handout and activity. thanks! m\\n\\nthank you for the great curriculum guide. i began a project based inquiry learning project this semester with the 7th grade challenge class. their final challenge was to create a video story or game that included ecological principles we explored during the unit to be able to present to a panel as to further educate the younger generation. i took the curriculum guide and modified it a bit to be more of a self-paced packet. can i say that it was great! the students who could move faster did so. they were required to complete all the different skill sets; however, igave them the freedom to incorporate a few into one which they did with out me telling them. their final projects are wonderful. in an effort to assist with the managing of the files, i use a free pbworks account where students could upload their works in progress and then post their final projects. this seemed to be a bit more focused arena for the students. studentsviewed the other projects and collaborated online as well as did a gallery walk on the final day. they learned some valuable tools. i had mostof my class staying daily to work on scratch. additionally, i had others that weren\\'t in my classes want to learn. thank you for the incredible material that has really sparked learning for many!\\n\\nis there a public url? i\\'d love to see your projects and i\\'m interested to know more about how you used the pbworks account for sharing works in progress.\\n\\ni use scratch as part of our middle school innovation lab design studio program. this curriculum document is a very useful tool and i greatly appreciate those who created it. like many curriculum documents, however, i find it to be too much of a bottom up approach. i have found over the years that the non-intuitive approach of teaching top down works better in the development of creative and criticial thinking. that is, my students start by identifying a problem that they want to solve or a goal they want to achieve and then drill down to figure out what knowledge they need to learn and find or create the resources that they need. i found that if i introduce the features of scratch from the bottom up that this limited the students\\' creativity. it locked them in to solutions that only used those features. i want them to learn to ask, \"what features do ineed in this language and how can i create them,\" rather than, \"how can i build something on top of the features that i have been taught.\" i am using the curriculum document starting from the end, with the final project, and then letting students identify features that they think they need, and knowledge that they need to learn. for instance, they figured out that they need to learn how an arrow flies through the air for a game they wanted to create so they first went off and taught themselves enough physics. when they figure out that they need to write a piece of a program that repeates a certain number of times or until some event happens, they go look up if that is possible in scratch. this is how i did engineering for many years and i want the students to be innovators and the drivers who create new technologies.\\n\\ni used session #3 in my class with kids ages 10-16 when i first showed the \"bosses\" the videos, the reaction was no way, this is going to be hard. i must admit i had the same reaction. i (and i think the kids) figured that the video with mitch would be possible, but some of the later ones would be too challenging. well i was wrong (love when that happens, i learn something new :) the kids did great and were able to program each other in a relatively short time. one thing i changed from the draft is i had thebosses and bossed switch. show i would show the first video and a would program b, then i would have b program a. so they all got an opportunity to see both sides. i asked the question, \"how is this like programming?\" which is similar to \"how does this activity relate to scratch?\"  below are some of the comments from the students: we didn\\'t know what was in the mind of the programmer. we had no idea what they wanted us to do. we had no \"insight\" (note: i also have them taking the coursera cs101 course on their own in a \"flipped classroom\" type approach. one of the early comments in the course was that the computer, unlike a human has know insight into what you mean). we can only use words. after class i realized one of the questions i should have asked is \"how is this not like programming?\" i will try this next time. for homework, i am having them create a \"dance\" program, where they take pictures of themselves in different dance positions, \"green screen\" their bodies out of the pictures and then program each other to dance. i am also using scratch connect and etoys so they can create a \"game controller\" in etoys to control the dancers and can have a dance party on one screen projected on the wall, each student controlling their own dancer using etoys (via remote sensor protocol). can\\'t wait until makey makey comes out so i can try incorporating that. note: i had a class before this where we did \"how to train your robot\" using dr. techniko\\'s hand out and having them program their parents. not sure how much this impacted how quickly/easilythey were able to program each other. i really like your approach of having kids \"step away from the computer and no one gets hurt\" approach. i try to do this a lot, partly so they can get in touch and reflect upon the knowledge they have in their own bodies and also to give them different context for experiening the same/similar concepts and ideas,\\n\\nhi stephen, thanks for sharing your experiences! i love the idea of having the partners switch so they get a chance to experience what it\\'s like to program and be programmed. :) i\\'d love to hear how the dance programs turn out! m\\n\\ni taught session 3 again to a different group of kidsand noticed how some of the moves are symmetrical (especially indance1). i pointed this out to the kids (tried to do so through questions) and asked how are these moves the same and different. which led to the realization that its the same basic move once with the right hand and once with the left hand. this then lead to a short discussion on how we can have a common set of instructions used by different body parts/costumes/objects. in a future version of the class i would like to try and point this out immediately after dance 1 and see how many kids \"get the idea\" and use it for dances 2 and 4. dance 3 doesn\\'t really lend itself to this idea. it would be nice if the third video also included ceratin moves like this so that i can use \"the same script\" with different body parts through all the dances to help re-inforce this concept. of course, the videos are so well done (and the more i watch them i appreciate how well thought out) there may be a reasonhttp://vimeo.com/28612800 does not have a similar pattern. one thing that i believe could be useful for teachers is a set of additional \"questions\" and/or short videos on \"how to use these sessions.\" that said you have to balance providing a quick to the point lesson plan for busy teachers with more in depth/additional materials. perhaps as an optional section or additional resources and ideas for each session in a way that is easy for teachers to find and use (ie: not just in discussion notes :)\\n\\ni have been using the scratch curriculum guide for about one month now to advance my 6th graders\\' knowledge of scratch. i started my scratch unit by having stduents complete the scratch cards, the orange square purple circle project, a scratch design studio project of their own choosing, and a remix project. i then had them start working on the scratch curriculum guide projects. i let the students work at their own pace since they all completed the scratch cards at different times. when i use the scratch curriculum guide next time, i will have all of the students complete the same project on the same day. i will also do the scratch design studio project and the remix after they have already completed the scratch curriculum guide. i will also add the space invaders project as a remix project and use the scratch diving deeper challenges to push their programming to the next level. i love giving my students a packet of projects to complete at their own pace, but i found that some students completed 10 projects in the time some of their classmastes created 2 or 3. i would love to have them moving through the curriculum more as a group so they can collaborate, share their projects, give each other feedback, and discuss different methods for solving the same challenge.\\n\\nhi megan, i love your idea of using a combination of scratch design studio themes, remixing projects, and diving deeper challenges to help students continue to engage creatively and move further with programming.thanks for sharing your feedback and ideas! m\\n\\nhi scratched team, first i want to thank you for this awesome work. your curriculum has been a great help for me. i have used it as an inspiration to prepare my sessions, sometimes using it as-is, sometimes inventing my own activities. so i thought it was time to give feedback on what has worked well or not so well for me. its a lot of information that i tried to summarize, dont hesitate to ask for more details if my point is not clear. in my sessions, i have 10 kids from 8 to 10 for an hour and a half every school week. we are are now getting to sessions 14. as a general rule, i have found that what works better is to show at the beginning of sessions examples of target projects to give them ideas of what they can do. the projects have to be simple enough that they will be able to do it, and generic enough that they leave room for personalization, personal creativity. i have sometimes used the curriculum project examples (for the art session #5 for example), or made/curated my own.it works better than trying to explain how to do things at the beginning of the sessions (a mistake i made at the beginning). then i give them the paper handouts with project code example, and i explain on demand when they want to do something something and are wondering how. examples that work well: - session #5 - to invent stories creating their own sprites and background, i had this studio of examples : session #4 and 5 were too much alike, kids had a repetition feeling, and were less motivated. session #5 art projects : i used your projects examples and handouts, and it worked great. session #6 : i did not get the point of the 6-word story, so i did not try it. instead, i replaced session 6 and 8 with a three sessions work on creating stories, that worked tremendously well: - first workshop : i told kids that that would be creating a story but that they couldnt use the image library in scratch, and would have to create their own (drawing, drawing with scratch, modelling playdough, photographing persons and objects) showed them examples i had created aor curated : http://scratch.mit.edu/studios/292530/ . i had kids pick up an image among 10 that made them feel like telling a story, creating groups with people having chosen the same image. then they spent the sessions inventing the story and creating the sprites and background, and we took pictures. - second workshop : work on notebook to remember the story outline. import images in scratch and create project. a lot of time was spent in importing and clipping images, so one session was not enough to finish the project. - third workshop : finish project. session #7 (remix) was very valuable. for some kids, the second time changing computers was too much, and they dropped it. these were the less proficient kids. so next time might do only one swap. the session led to very interesting discussion with the kids on how you should save your work (some team made huge modification and previous versions were lost), on how it was great to enhance some one else program, and how hard it was to see your work modified. session #9 debug and session #10 maze: great. as i have an hour and a half, i mixed it with the maze, and i used a makey makey and big tinfoil arrows to play the maze, and this was a great session. #11 maze extensions (variable) works great, my only reserve is that the variable project example have different level of complexity, and it was harder for some kids as i distributed the projects randomly. having the kid explain what they learn and show how they used it in their maze extension was very effective. #12 more games : i extended it on two sessions, as kids wanted to finish their projects. i used a leap motion for more fun on the collision project. the scrolling project is way too hard. i think i will replace it with a change level when reaching a door on the stage kind of example. i will keep the scrolling example for older kids, or if a kid specifically asks for it. design notebook : i have had difficulties in systematically use them. i have been thinking of preparing specific design notebook with an entry for each session. do you have best practices on how this topic? i would be very interested.\\n\\nso where does one locate the \"about me\"

the creativity and thinking of my students. i am teaching at a new school this year as a k-6 \"enrichment specialist.\" the school\\'s population is high-poverty (97%)-low-test-scoring and most of the day for students focuses on reading and math instruction. i\\'ve been hired to combine science, art, and technology in a class that takes place during the regular teacher\\'s prep time, rotating with 4 other prep teachers through the year. i\\'ll see some grades 14 times over the year, and others about 45 times. the overall goal is to promote deeper thinking, creativity, and inquiry, and scratch will be a big help! i would like to find a way to assess where the kids are now and see what impact the class has had at the end of the year. i can make rubrics for scratch projects or track changes in a few kids\\' approaches. i am curious, though, whether there is any sort of measurement instrument or accepted practice out there that addresses overall problem solving or creativity. several of you have written about your research projects and i wonder whether you found a way to quantify data for a whole class or school of kids, one that would also be practical for a teacher to administer. obervational data would be hard to collect because i\\'m in the moment teaching. suggestions are appreciated. karen\\n\\ndear karen, i\\'m in the same point .... i\\'m trying to develop some rubrics for measuring the scratch influence... and it\\'s not easy. since you wrote this post have you had any answers? we are thinking about to create two rubrics to measure what influence has scratch in the innovative thinking of the learners. to analyse the questions made for students (only when they are scratching) in class to analyse the projects made by the students are you still working around this subject? i\\'m very interested on it. jon. p.d.: excuse me for my english... i\\'m a eternal learner ;-)\\n\\nwell ididn\\'t think that others were thinking as iwas about scratch and how to measure the thinking of their students. iwas just recently intorduced to the program and feel that it is a great program to teach students how think and problem solve. i currenly work at an \"at-risk\" high school and feel that by using scratch it would open up the minds of my students, but itoo am stumped on how to analyze their thought process through the program. i think iam just going to have them work on a simple project with a partner and write a reflection on their experience and from those papers iwill see what comes up. becc\\n\\n>> any sort of measurement instrument or accepted practice out there that addresses overall problem solving or creativity. << i\\'m in a vaguely similar situation (in my case, as a gifted/enrichment k-2 teacher for 4 buildings). the assessment thing has dogged me for 3 years. there\\'s no question that the kids benefit but how much and in what ways. if, say, the superintendent wanted me to justify my salarly with some hard numbers, i\\'d be caught flat footed. without going into too much detail, there simply is no shorthand way to measure problem solving or creative thinking and get some nice, chartable numbers that show growth over time. rubrics are a good though labor intensive way. there\\'s a nice article worth reading with some positive research on the reliability and validity of a creativity rubric at http://www3.wooster.edu/teagle/docs/balchin%20assessing%20students%20creativity.pdf. it seems to me to have a possibility to look as some other, indirect measures that i don\\'t have access to. you said that some kids you see 14 times and others 45 times. so you have groups of kids with well defined amounts of time with you. well...you could look at attendance rates, discipline referals, overall grades, etc of these two different groups of kids and maybe make some valid points about the benefits of being with you more versus less. it wouldn\\'t necessarily give you information about thinking and creativity skills but it could show patterns of positive reponses that indirectly show these skills.\\n\\nhopefully soon i will have some form of measuring impact of scratch. so far ihave measured the affective impact of scratch in class ( which has been very positive and happy so far). i am now looking also to measure the learning impact of scratch. i did try before in my honours project (my paper is in the resources section and there will be another paper soon) this was measured against standards in an ict test given within the uk. i am now focusing on the new curriculum in scotland and how using scratch to make games with children affects learning.\\n\\ni have just completed a small qualitative research study with a class of 10 - 11 year olds in an irish primary school, focusing on

fanatic, was given the task of creating a very short, introductory lesson that is going to last about 1.5 hours, and use scratch. i started to work on it but i also would like to hear from the experienced educators. the groups will probably consist of 9-10 children, ages between 10-13, and almost no exposure to programming beforehand. and we\\'ll have 1.5 hours to introduce scratch. (during the same day, they will visit other sessions / tracks such as robotics programming (with dwengo robot), lego mindstorms, etc.) all tips (including pitfalls, things to avoid, etc) are welcome. cheers, -- emre sevin\\n\\ndear emre, i\\'m new to scratch but have many years of teaching experience. maybe i could help you plan? i\\'m also interested in the event itself; where/when will it take place, & is it open to any students? cheers, eileen\\n\\nhello emre we had a couple of introductory workshops this year and almost every time we had the same routine: first we show the software interface, the stage area, sprite and script area and the blocks. we show the children how to put together two blocks (we usually start with the \"move\" block and ask them what will happened if we will change the number from 10 to 100). we show them 2 simple projects, one game one story / animation, and give them an open task. \"create a project with at least one sprite moving side to side and in the middle something surprising happens\". we try to stay as un-constructed as possible. usually, most kids start working on the task and quickly drift away, each child to his own style, and this method works great for us. the biggest pitfall is when you show the example projects, most chances are that some kids will try to create a project same as what you showed, so try to keep them simple as possible and without any advanced features like broadcast, variables and so on if you need anything else, feel free to ask. good luck orad\\n\\nthe scratch workshop guide might be of some help. (there are sample agendas towards the end of the guide...)\\n\\ndear emre, i\\'ve good experience with the standard scarcth cards. after at most five minutes of explaining the interface, i\\'ll get them programming. the first quarter of an hour i\\'m busy with distributing the cards, after that the children take care of that themselves so i can concentrate on questions raised. i prefer the kids to work in groups of two: pair programming as promoted at berkeley. main benefits of using the cards are: everybody gets the same basic knowledge scratch interface is understood by all to keep the faster kids busy i\\'ve got more elaborate lessons at hand. feel free to use dutch material published at scratchweb.nl. best regards, joek\\n\\njoek, karen and orad, thank you very much for pointers to the relevant material and sharing your experience. i\\'ll examine and utilize them for our events.\\n\\ndear eileen, currently there is no fixed date for the events. we first plan to do a few dry-runs with the children of the people involved with this project. if we can manage to do that and the results turn out to be positive, we plan to repeat it on a bigger scale, in other words repeat

introduce scratch to children whenever i have time (that is almost always on weekends, since i work full-time during the week). feel free to contact me via my e-mail address: emre . sevinc @ gmail . com\\n\\ni would most certainly recommend having the students do the \"about me\" project. it is a great way for students to get exposure and also share information about themselves with each other (especially if you make time for students to walk around and check out each other\\'s projects). it is also really easy to customize based on varrying levels; for advanced students its always fun to challenge them to build-in mini-games or easter eggs into their \"about me\" projects. i have some handouts i have used for this, if you are interested let me know and i can share.\\n\\nwhat to avoid: pen: you don\\'t get really interesting stuff if/else: scratch already includes if/else in form of \"when\" blocks most of the sensors operators variables: almosto everything can be done in scratch without using variables instead, i would insist on: movement (especially sliding) sound costumes/saying (if allowed by time constraints) my 1.5 hours plan would be the following (see sample project): showing interesting projects (only run) scratch gui: cat sprite, blocks, movement on stage by sliding left and right, making noises with sound blocks when each of the sliding actions ends checking the sequence of highlighted blocks by setting slow single stepping; stopping single stepping right after creating different movements when left/right keys are pressed adding a new sprite (drum) making the drum play when it is clicked making the cat jump 2/3 times (by sliding) when the drum is clicked by connecting drum and cat by messages so you are introducing: what can be reached (by showing the interesting projects) basic blocks (movement and sound) snapping blocks together the concept of sequence (with single stepping) i/o interaction (left/right keys, mouse click) interaction of multiple sprites (cat and drum) events (scripts triggered by left/right and mouse click) parallelism (different scripts running together) i think it is a lot in just one hour. then, if you still have time, you can add costumes/backgrounds, saying, etc.\\n\\nstefano and susan, thank you very much for further comments. i\\'ll take them into account, too. stefano: your comment is interesting: \"variables: almost everything can be done in scratch without using variables\" how about a quiz program that tracks the score of the participant? ifound it a very motivating example of introducing variables. besides, why not introduce such a fundamental concept?\\n\\n> how about a quiz program that tracks the score of the participant? ifound it a very motivating example of introducing variables. besides, why not introduce such a fundamental concept? variables are not a fundamental concept of computation. functional programming doesn\\'t use them. variables are there as they are the evolution of the \"memory cell\" concept, used at the beginning of programming. with variables you \"take note\" of your environment. in scratch very often you don\\'t nedd them, as you have sensors and reporters (position x, position y, etc). they give you the possibility to look at your environment, without having to take note by means of a further instrument. even a score can be managed in scratch with a \"progress bar\" or by numerical costumes of several sprites. but variables are a very good example and when and way to use a variable. indeed, a score is really something of which you take note. every concept of programming should be only introduced when it is convenient and clear with respect to a different solution. and the score, as i said, is a very good example of introducing the concept of variable.\\n\\ndear stefano > variables are not a fundamental concept of computation. functional programming doesn\\'t use them. > variables are there as they are the evolution of the \"memory

having had my share of common lisp & scheme, and nowadays dabbling in scala, i also wish functional programming was more widespread. on the other hand, the lack of creating new functions, or should say \\'blocks\\', in scratch, is a big obstacle in this respect. if we had such a feature in scratch, then it would be easy to gently introduce even many more advanced concepts to children.\\n\\non

functions, or should say \\'blocks\\', in scratch, is a big obstacle that is why, as also suggested by joek, i usually use byob to teach programming. and new blocks allow me to introduce variables in

over 15 years and for 15 years - we have had the same problems - convincing teachers to teach with or about technology. so perhaps we should let kids learn and bypass the teachers. i am working with two teachers right now who use learning centers and one of the centers enables students to learn scratch on their own or with peers. my study stemmed from the hole-in-the-wall studies where kids in the slums and countrysides of india learned computer literacy skills on their own. my paper - http://btcactus.blogspot.com/2010/01/if-they-dont-test-you-on-it.html - if you feel like reading my

scratch.\\n\\none technical problem that gives me headaches is updated versions of software. our school has classroom machines, two labs, media center mini lab, and a cart of laptops. i am not the tech person and don\\'t have permissions to add software to anything but the laptops. i think we\\'ve got it under control now, but for a couple years, i couldn\\'t count on any given machine having the current version of scratch installed.

technologies? explore computational ideas through personally-meaningful projects? join us at the mit media lab for this four-hour byol (bring your own laptop) workshop, where we will introduce you to scratch, a programming environment that enables students to create interactive stories, games, animations, and simulations. as students create and share scratch projects, they learn to think creatively, reason systematically, and work collaboratively -- and develop as computational thinkers and computational creators. this event isopen to all boston-area educators who have no prior scratch experience. during this workshop, we will: explore the core ideas underlying scratch experience scratch through demonstrations and hands-on activities discuss strategies for integrating scratch into classroom practice introduce you toscratched, the website where educators share their scratch ideas, experiences, and resources we particularly encourage educators from the same school, program, etc. to attend together as a group. registration is limited to 40 people. the workshop is $10 and includes breakfast. register online at:http://scratchintrooct2011.eventbrite.com/\\n\\n', '16272': \"hi! i am an artist and an art educator. within the past two years, i have become very interested in incorporating technology in my lessons for children. now i am teaching video game design with scratch and the new course i am desiging is not very long in time. i am thinking the children may not have time to draw their own original sprites and stages. ultimately they will have to use the already created sprites and stages which they will have to import from the files of images saved in scratch. this sacrifice of drawing their own sprite and stage upsets the artist side of me. do you think it is a bad idea to have the chldren use the already created sprites and stages for the sake of saving time to learn the programming? the goal of the course is to teach children, whom have never used computers before, to confidently use computers and to problem solve with technology. thank you for any advice you can give. best, tiffany\\n\\nperhaps iam not the best person to reply to this since i have a bias toward software engineering (more than 30 years working on the software development side.) but here goes... i spend only one week teaching the kids to develop their own artwork. it is enough time to become familiar with the tool and to give them a taste of exercising their artistic muscles. byob/scratchis not the right tool for learning this discipline. if iwere to devote more time, iwould teach them to use photoshop, illustrator,and/or gimp. byob provides an interesting mechanism for using created graphics, but a poor tool for creating them. the course iteach is a course in software engineering. itry to expose the kids to a wide variety of information which focuses on software engineering. as imentioned before, this includes a week of drawing sprites as i see this being an important part of development, but in addition to the basics, i dive into recursion, artificial intelligence, algorithmic complexity, software testing, etc. in addition, i use other tools to dip into web development, database development, etc... i also spend a week developing sound effects for which byob/scratch has a record button but no editing/modification features so ihave to introduce another tool there (audacity). we spend a significant amount of time collaborating on projects with different teams developing pieces of programs which are consumed by the group. i also have them develop code within frameworks that allow them to focus on the concepts we are trying to learn. leveraging the work of others is critical to developing software which exceeds human capability to develop in a reasonable time frame, if at all... how many man-hours are represented by any of the applications you run today?iintroduce them to free resources on the web for sprites and sounds and recommend they use them/modify them as needed. iwant to expose them to a variety of concepts from which they can take more specialized courses in the future. in the end my goal is for them to learn to write basic programs (which in byob thankfully is a lot of fun video games) and to become familiar with the tools needed should they wish to pursue other avenues for career interest. so iguess the short answer is (too late, i know)i do not think it is a bad idea to teach the kids to leverage the work of others for the sake of learning programming. on the contrary, ithink it is critical to their success.\\n\\nlooking back at the goal of the course i now see how it is ok to use the already created sprites and stages.\\n\\ndear al, thank you for your thoughtful reply. now looking back at my question, i feel that it is ok to allow my students to utilize the sprites and stages that others created because it gives them more time to program, which is the ultimate goal of the program. i will follow your lead in using the beginning of the course to teach the ways to use the various drawing tools then after that we will mostly use our time to program. my students will be using computers for the first time and as a matter of fact it might be the first time that they have ever seen a computer so i want to keep my lessons focused and simple. i need to be careful not to overwhelm them or intimidate them with my course. when teaching your course do you use a projector to demonstrate how to create a game? the classrooms for this course will not have projectors so i am trying to think of other ways to help the teachers explain how to move blocks around without them having to go to each student individually. do you have any suggestions? flash cards? felt boards with movable pieces? do you have any of your students games posted on scratch? i really appreciate your advice and i look forward to hearing from you! best,\\n\\nit can be fun to customise the existing sprites too, which provides a balance between getting rapid results and enabling students to express themselves.\\n\\nthat's a good point sean. i forgot about that option. i will make some customized sprites to show my students the different options. thank you! tiffany\\n\\nas a first time scratch teacher myself, i think it's ok to use canned sprites, get 'em going on the simple logic programming, then steer the kids to a more customized stage background. you didn't mention the student's grade & class size, do you feel they're mostly budding artist ? or geeks &hackers to-be ? i think we're all guilty of teaching what we know. being a software developer myself, i naturally lean on the programming & logicside of teaching. to be honest, scratch drawing tools isn't that great ... video game design is a field right-down-the-middle, maybe you can guide them with story book outline, skeatch out the game board & sprite interactions, get small pieces working, then go back & pretty it up on asethics.\\n\\n\", '1062': 'some of my students claim their scratch programs run differently (timings are off?) on the website than do when running locally...are there known problems with this?\\n\\nthat is an existing issue with the java player used on the site. however, in my experience, a lot of the trouble that studnts have with timing has to do with how they trigger events. trying to sync things up with the \"timer\" or with they \"wait___ sec\" blocks will typically suffer from some sort of lag. on the hand, chaining a series of events together with the \"boadcast,\" or \"broadcast and wait,\" blocks will help a lot. this tutorial on creating dialog may help clarify what i am describing.\\n\\nthe dialog tutorial is nice. how about one for changing scenes (including backgrounds and characters)?\\n\\ngreat idea. here\\'s my first pass at it: http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/ashbyr1/714297 if you share it with students, please let me know if they ask for

system been added in scratch 2.0? i have a bunch of teacher eager to get their classes involved in scratch but not without an easy way to generate class accounts.\\n\\nhi catherine, you can use scratch 2 without the educator accounts until it is setup. we just have the pupils download to their documents to save and upload from their documents to open. we have version 1.4 and version 2 of the super scratch programming adventure book. the main difference i can see is the slight changes in the interface. the sequence of adding the blocks etc, is the same from what i have seen. so yes you can use the version 1.4 of that book with scratch 2. hope that helps. andy\\n\\n', '39044': 'the organization i work for (the urban league of essex county) was awarded a small grant to run a demonstration

have they ever heard of scratch before. however i don\\'t want to spend fifty minutes walking them through all of the cool things they can do with scratch because i want them to use the majority of the time discovering/creating their own thing. ideally i\\'d like to give the class a 5 to 10 minute introduction to the interface of scratch and then let them have at it. does anyone have any suggestions on what i should go over in that 5 to 10 minute intro in order to maximize both what they can do and the time they have to work with? please help me!\\n\\ni\\'d love to hear any of your advice. i am teaching 9th graders for 3 40 minute periods starting monday + wednesday is the last day of their marking period i am going to start with the instructional videos and pause so they all

introducing scratch for the first time, i intentionally avoid the traditional overview approach, which can drain precious minutes. instead, i lead students through creating their accounts (or opening the offline version, which does not require logging in), then introduce the objective(s) for the starter project, showing a finished version, then perhaps doing the first step or two on the

[i remixed the orginal project and made these 2 code changes here:http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/12981133/] depending on the student\\'s learning style, it might be a good idea to just give them one of the above solutions, perhaps just the y fix, then see if they can figure out how to adjust x on their own. then they can transfer those solutions to the other platform(s). once mastered, you could challenge them to set a hotspot for the feet so the feet must touch the top of the platform for the monkey to land on it. and/or a platform that hits a monkey in the chest might send them tumbling rather than pulling them up/onto it. for an older student add a bit of physics in the form of acceleration as they are falling.\\n\\nalso helps to increase the speed of falling, perhaps \"change y by -5,\" otherwise it\\'s hard to get past the green platform once you\\'ve landed on it.\\n\\nthanks derek. great help. sorry to be cheeky but how do i do a hot spot?

(i just finished writing a paper about these observations [a qualitative research study]). my study was very similar to the hole-in-the-wall studies conducted in india - http://www.hole-in-the-wall.com/findings.html to my suggestion: the students have just started using the pre-made scratch cards http://scratched.media.mit.edu/resources/scratch-cards. ihave noticed that many of the students who have individualized education plans (special education students) are having a real hard time distinguishing between the motion (blue), looks (purple) sound (purple shade) and sensing (light blue) blocks of code. the shades are too similar for many of them to make choices and they are getting frustrated. has anyone else found this to be a problem? if so, is there a way to change the color choices of the blocks of code? the kids love scratch and i have never seen a group of kids want to learn a program with so much enthusiasm. i hope that the programmers consider my request.\\n\\ninteresting observation! one possible explanation: the colors on the printed scratch cards might not match the colors as they appear on the computer screen. that could make it difficult for kids to find the right category for a block when trying to recreate the script on a scratch card. does that seem possible? i realize that your methodology may not allow asking direct questions, but if it does you might put blocks of the troublesome colors on the screen then ask the students to find the category that they came from. my guess is that most non-colorblind students will be able do this fairly easily. thanks for your report. i'll be curious to hear if others have seen similar problems with the colors. it's great that the kids are so enthusiastic! :-)\\n\\nhi john, thanks for the response. you are correct that the cards do not match the shades of block code colors in scratch. but the big problem is getting them to see the correct shades of blue and purple while in the program, even if they were not following the card directions.\\n\\ni agree with you christopher, at least you are not using starlogo tng which has even more colors close to each other. tell me, was the difficulty seeing the color mostly limited to the boys?\\n\\ninteresting, you are right, those block colors are close! i haven't run into this as a problem, but my experience with special needs students is in a setting of regular ed classes, often with kids at different levels partner programming. what sorts of color choices would work better? the softer colors for backgrounds help the stacks of colors in scripts stay in the background. a redder red, for example, seems distracting. karen r\\n\\nhi carl, i have not had any girls have trouble, just boys.\\n\\ni think if each block was a different color instead of a shade, that might/would be helpful.\\n\\nhi. i wonder if adding a little symbol to each block for each group of blocks will help, eg. a little black circle to the left of all motion blocks versus a little black square to the left of all sensing blocks, etc.\\n\\nhi ai boon, i do hope the scratch programmers consider this. thanks for your thoughts.\\n\\n\", '14088': 'i have put this discussion under \"how do i\" category. because i\\'m new to scratch (but not to programming) itself and this is the first time i\\'m interacting on this board. i really need to know certain things. like 1. i\\'m planning to add scratch programming lessons on one of my blogs. i have read that the scratch curriculum guide is distributed under creative commons license, so i can use it as my reference in my blog posts. can i copy-paste exercises and screen shots of scratch on my blog?

sign up here. check out the newsuper scratch programming adventure! book. questions and suggestions rosemary suggested an app inventor meetup. participants expressed interested in a session to learn more about scratch 2.0 (ie: clone and cloud variable features) and having more hands-on design challenges. fran requested that scratch 2.0 be developed for as many platforms as possible in order for scratch to reach a wide audience. rosie was curious if there is a scratch reference guide. one is available here. another suggestion is to use ctrl + click (right click) on blocks to access the help menu in scratch or exploreother reference guides on scratched. another participant was interested in being able to carry scripts across multiple sprites. suggestions for the scratch 2.0 paint editor: eraser tool, line tool, fill bucket is confusing, larger pen size options someone pointed out that scratch 2.0 should give automatic attribution to sprite creators when sharing sprites using the backpack feature. join us for the next scratch educator meetup on saturday, november 10 at mit. registration is available at http://2012-2013meetups.eventbrite.com. thanks for meeting up with us!\\n\\n\", '31976': \"are there any scratch educator meet ups in the uk?\\n\\nhi anne, not yet, but the scratched team has just released a scratch educator meetup guide for anyone interested in organizing a local meetup. perhaps you might be interested in hosting one in the uk?

what do they create in these environments, and how satisfied are they with their creations? which features of blocks environments help or hinder users?how do we know? which of these features are worth incorporating into more traditional ides? what helpful features are missing? how can blocks environments and associated curricular materials be made more accessible to everyone, especially those with disabilities? can blocks programming appeal to a wider range of interests (e.g., by allowing connections to different types of devices, web services, data sources, etc.)? what are the best ways to introduce programming to novices and to support their progression towards mastery? do these approaches differ for for learners of computing basics and for makers? what are the conceptual and practical hurdles encountered by novice users of blocks languages when they face the transition to text languages and traditional programming communities? what can be done to reduce these hurdles? how can we best harness online communities to support growth through teaching, motivating, and providing inspiration and feedback? what roles should collaboration play in blocks programming? how can environments support that collaboration? in these environments, what data can be collected, and how can that data be analyzed to determine answers to questions like those above? how can we use data to answer larger scale questions about early experiences with programming? what are the lessons learned (both positive and negative) from creating first programming environments that can be shared with future environment designers? submission (due 24 jul 2015) we invite two kinds of submissions: a 1 to 3 page position statement describing an idea or research question related to the design, teaching, or study of blocks programming environments. a paper (up to 6 pages) describing previously unpublished results involving the design, study, or pedagogy of blocks programming environments. all submissions must be made as pdf files to theeasy chair blocks and beyond workshop submission site. because this workshop will be discussion-based, rather than a mini-conference, the number of presentation/demonstration slots are limited. authors for whom presentation or demonstration is essential should indicate this in their submission. important dates 24 jul. 2015:submissions due. 14 aug. 2015:author notification. 4 sep. 2015:camera ready copies due. 22 oct. 2015:workshop in atlanta. 23 oct. 2015:extra day for blocks language developers, researchers, and teachers to interact workshop website for more information on the workshop, including a tentative workshop schedule, see the blocks and beyond workshop website. organizers franklyn turbak (chair), wellesley college. david bau, google jeff gray, university of alabama caitlin kelleher,washington university josh sheldon, mit. program committee neil brown, university of kent dave culyba, carnegie mellon university sayamindu dasgupta, mit deborah fields, utah state university neil fraser, google mark friedman, google dan garcia, university of california, berkeley benjamin mako hill, university of washington fred martin, university of massachusetts lowell paul medlock-walton, mit yoshiaki matsuzawa, aoyama gakuin university amon millner, olin college ralph morelli, trinity college brook osborne, code.org jonathan protzenko, microsoft research alexander repenning, university of colorado, boulder ben shapiro, tufts university wolfgang slany, graz university of technology daniel wendel, mit\\n\\n\", '13241': 'it is necessary to document or evidence sequencing or programming, is there a way for a student to print the entire code base for a project so that it could be annotated and used as evidence of having achieved certain skills or levels in programming?

love the cloning feature but needs some explanation. i was not sure what code must go into clone startup and what can go into the main loop. a best practices lesson on this is important. did you remove the commenting feature - my students do not write comments but am hoping they will one day! i hope that you will provide a class account - a local community so my students can safely share their early projects within a class but not the entire community. i am very excited about the vector graphics. my students have used inkscape, open source vector graphics software and now they can create directly in scratch. vector graphics have a clear math connection and can be an integral part of the lesson, not just as a way to create graphics. i would like a way for you to add copyright/acknowledge images to a project - make students aware of what they get from google images is not necessarily free and ok to use!

we could begin by introducing ourselves and the research we\\'re conducting or interested in.\\n\\nto get the introductions started... i\\'m a member of the scratch designteam in the lifelong kindergarten group at mit. i am also pursuing doctoral research in the child development department at tufts on emotions and motivation. i am interested in research that can inform the design of scratch 2.0 to better support youth learning--and to engage youth with diverse interests in creating projects. i\\'m excited about the research strand yasmin kafai and others have suggested to investigate learning trajectories in scratch-- how youth learning with and use of scratch changes over time.\\n\\nhi i\\'m eliza dresang and i\\'m a faculty member at the university of washington information school. for almost two decades now i\\'ve been interested in the information behavior of youth growing up digital. i loved being at the scratch conference because i felt among \\'kindred souls.\\' i am not conducting research at the moment with scratch but i\\'m very interested in reserach anyone else is conducting. i\\'m working with doctoral student kyungwon koh, who suggested this discussion, and she will soon be embarking on part of her dissertation research with scratch users. right now i\\'m one degree removed.\\n\\nhi, my name is kyungwon koh, a doctoral candidate at school of library and information studies in florida state university. it was really nice meeting people at 2010 scratch@mit. my research interest areas include youth information behavior, information literacy, and library and information services and resources for youth in the digital age. i found scratch to be an exemplary place to observe new and innovative youth information behavior--that is, the ways young people seek, evaluate, use, share, and create information to enhance learning or pursue personal and aesthetic growth in the digital age. as part of my dissertation research, i am investigating information-related behaviors of scratchers and look forward to sharing what i\\'ll find in the scratch community! :-)\\n\\nhi everyone! i\\'m a member of the scratch team and a phd student at the mit media lab. i\\'m interested in the intersection of computer science and the social sciences (also known as social computing). as part of my research, i led the development of the scratch website. i\\'m interested in analyzing the way people use the website to better understand how to design social systems to support amateur creativity.\\n\\nhi. i am ai boon tan. i am interested in anything about scratch and like eliza i am interested in research anyone else is conducting. i am just a scratcher, lifelong student and new teacher. i love to find out more about using scratch as an educational and therapeutic tool - for motivation, for people with dementia, for engaging people or children with special needs, for art and poetry, for thinking... the list goes on. one day, it will be nice to do real research but for now, i just explore scratch with my students and we are really loving it. : )\\n\\nhi im amanda wilson, ive recently graduated and my honours project focused on teaching children(age 8/9 years) about programming with scratch (it also looked at the affective impact as well). i am now starting my phd which will be in the area of games based learning. i am interested in how scratch fits in with the new scottish curriculum for excellence and want to explore this more as it can be used for a variety of learning outcomes other than computing - maths/english/art to name some. i am also interested in the affective impact of scratch - my honours project showed that scratch was enjoyed week after week by the children in school and very rarely did anyone not enjoy a lesson. it also showed that the children did make some small steps in learning about programming, given my timescale i felt it was a great achievement as i only had 8 hours of lessons with them. i will at some point soon post my report onto the site or if anyone would like to read it please leave a message.\\n\\ni\\'m kylie peppler, a faculty member in the learning sciences program at indiana university, bloomington. my doctoral dissertation was supported by the spencer foundation to work with dr. yasmin kafai at ucla and focused on using scratch as a platform for interactive media-art-making. we worked with the folks at the mit media lab to develop and test the first versions of scratch at an after-school center, called the computer clubhouse, in south los angeles. originally, scratch was designed for the computer clubhouse network to engage youth in programming via media mixing. much of the research is still ongoing but many of our findings have been written up in conference proceedings and research articles. i thought i would list the references below for anyone that\\'s interested. we also have a co-edited book that highlights some of our scratch-related work titled, the computer clubhouse: constructionism and creativity in youth communities (teachers college press, 2009). additionally, i did my post-doctoral work at ucirvine with dr. mark warschauer. during this time, i worked with 80 second-graders using scratch in the classroom. a high proportion of these youth had (dis)abilities but were able to do amazing things in scratch. my current research is supported by the national science foundation and the macarthur foundation. feel free to contact me if you\\'re interested in learning more at kpeppler@indiana.edu. books kafai, y.b., peppler, k., & chapman, r.

schoolers\\' use of scratch to tell stories.in the past there have been a series of studies looking at how storytelling can offer kids an entrance into programming (most notably caitlin kelleher\\'s work with theintroductorylanguagealice, see http://www.alice.org/kelleher/storytelling/). i am interested in how storytellingwithscratch can actually offer more than simply a \"ramp\" to get kids interested in programming but also speak back to the writing process itself, teaching kids how to develop a narrative, reviseone\\'s work, andput together the basic elements of a story grammar. i am currentlydoingresearch in a middle school in west philadelphia, using scratch both insidea language artsclassroom as well as inan afterschool club,exploringkids\\' creations and how they potentially tie into their development as writers. i am very interested in learning what kind of scratch stories others are creating withkidsand what success educators have experiencedwith introducing scratch in terms of english/ languagearts as well as storytelling. i amalso getting more and more interested in how kids share their stories online at the website and howfanfiction genres (e.g., harry potter stories/ final fantasy animations) can offer kids a scaffold not only in how to use the scratch software but also asa means tonavigate the website itself and make wider connections online.\\n\\nmy name is gary. i am a doctoral student at university of georgia, majored in workforce education. i teach information technology and computer science at tri-cities high school. so, i am a full-time teacher and part-time student. my interests are about technology integration in classroom. now, i got this new tool, scratch, which i can use in classroom instruction. thanks for barb ericson at ga tech who directed this wonderful source to me. hopefully, we will work together more on promoting scratch in metro-atlanta public schools. i am working on my dissertation and trying to find a good research topic. i think using scratch is under the theory of constructionism that many scholars have studied on. it is great to get connected with best scholars in the field (i cited kafai and peppler all the time in my assignments). hopefully, i can locate an interesting topic to study. see you around.\\n\\ni have now posted in the resources section the conference paper which was co-authored by my project supervisor and i.\\n\\nhello, my name is yoshiro miyata. at chukyo university in japan, i have been studying trans-cultural learning, i.e., how we can learn collaboratively across cultural and generational boundaries. i have been interested in the potential of scratch to express, communicate, and collaborate to discover meaning that transcend cultural and generational differences. for this purpose, i am coordinating a collaborative project involving members of many universities, schools and community organizations who are using scratch as a tool to express themselves and their ideas.  we are now running a series of workshops with toyota city lifelong learning center in our local community in which small children, students, adults and elderies in the 70\\'s are collaborating to create scratch animations based on narrative stories using scanned hand drawings and recorded voice. in the past years, we ran workshops in which many children and adults from local brazilian community collaborated with japanese participants. we are excited by the possibilities of collaboration of such diverse age and culture groups. we are hoping to connect these local activities with activities around the world. right now, most partners are in japan, except one school in the us and one in inner-mongolia in china, and i\\'m hoping to find more partners from around the world. we have set up a website for this project: http://sns.or6.jp/school-news/school-news-english , which links to galleries of scratch projects and activities at various schools (mostly in japanese). we are trying to design this website as a gateway for introducing japanese scratch users to the users around the world. it would be wonderful if we can connect this project with similar attempts in other parts of the world. so, this is a research project trying to look at scratch as embedded in the learning environments including the web, classrooms, people and communities, and to experiment how we can design such learning environment as a whole so that the people involved can learn from each other, because of, not in spite of, the differences in cultures and generations.\\n\\nhello yoshiro i am a phd student with an interest in programming for children as part of their curriculum and the affective impact of it also. i am working with my childrens own school this year and teaching the p4/5 (age 7-9) with scratch. i think your project sounds very interesting and the class teacher i am working with has thought so too. at the moment i am introducing the children to scratch but by after christmas the children will be working on other projects and we would love to join your project. sorry i should say we are from a primary school in glasgow, scotland. could you send me some more details please awilson169@gmail.com amanda\\n\\nhello amanda thank you for your interest in our project. you are of course welcome to join the project! right now, students in four universities in japan are collaboratively working to help elementary school children in japan, usa, and china (inner-mongolia) in learning with scratch. it is exciting to have a new partner from scotland! (i\\'ve never been to scotland although i\\'ve visited nottingham and york in a study tour with my students.) i\\'ll try to describe how we have been collaborating so far. we usually start by exchanging scratch projects to introduce our schools and team members to each other.  (projects are in this gallery: http://scratch.mit.edu/galleries/view/99695) one such project has recently been selected as a \"featured project\" on the scratch site and received many interesting comments from all over the world. (http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/h309017/1340424) then each class (or team in the class) proposes ideas for collaborative scratch projects.  other school members look at these ideas and try to team up to work on ideas of common interests.  for example, children in an elementary school in japan have studied the environment around their school, such as living things in a nearby river, its water quality, the history of recycling in the community, etc.., and would try to express their observations with scratch animations. they are just beginning to learn scratch, so they will first send their drawings of their animation ideas to the university students, who will try to help the children create the animations. another example is an elementary school near boston, which is described in this blog post: http://sns.or6.jp/scratch-network-forum/-collaboration-blog/ideas-from-jackson-school-1109?lang=en i think you might be aware of this school and the teacher. amanda, if you can describe what you would like your students to learn with scratch, and ideas for collaboration, we can start discussing how to collaborate. please let me know if you have any questions or suggestions. i prefer discussing on an open forum like this, but you can email me at mudpie446 at_mark mac.com yoshiro\\n\\nmy name is stephen quinn, i am a final year student teacher in belfast, i am completing a study into the use of scratch in teaching secondary level maths (for pupils aged 11-18). i would be interested in talking to a teacher (from uk) that is using scratch in secondary maths lesson. this wouldreally help my research and study.\\n\\nhi, my name is ivete and currently in my last year of master studyat norwegian university of science and technology(ntnu). i am doing a research on quality of scratch project. if anyone have suggestion please write to me on oliveira.ivete@gmail.com. i also posted some question under \"researching scratch. :-)\\n\\nhi, i am a full time teacher at an international school in singapore and a part-time ed.d. student in \"instructional technology and distance education\", fancy title, but simply educational technology. my main focus is educational robotics but the foundation of that, as with scratch is constructionism so i am interested in scratch research that contributes to our understanding in that area. presently, i devote one quarter to scratch in my grade 8 (13 year olds) course. i might introduce it at a younger age as well, possibly linking it with wedo robotics kitsthat we have. as is so often the case, time is the issue. happy scratching and researching, wayne\\n\\nhi my field of study is it and i have ma degree from shiraz university, iran. i work on e-learning and teaching computer creativity to elementary students. also my ma thesis was in learning algorithmic thinking and programming to elementary students.i follow your discussions.it would be my chance using scratch in my classes from 2011 up to now.what are scientific papers or technical reports that are published based on elementary students? best regards mohammad\\n\\nhi iam vinaykumar from india. i just finished my mca. i have done my final sem project-research on scratch programming. my question is how scratch is going to provide computational thinking. we have scratch research team. we found some methods like working on fractal examples, recursion techniques. my project name is \"scratch for education and its localization\" - i made entire scratch enviroment in kannada and i have developed so many examples and made corresponding documentation in kannada. scratch supports many languages. if you consider india, peoples are of different languages are there. i have visited so many schools in villages and i taught scratch programming. i made research paper on 1. integrating language and arts with mit scratch 2. recursion- using scratch to teach recursion concept for novicers a. recursion - part 1 b. recursion - part2 c. recursion - part3 currently, i am creating a textbook on scratch programming in kannada. i am very interested to do research on scratch programming. we have separate scratch team here. currently i am working on this one only. my approach is cloud implementation of scratch programming in india where in one place the users should get all the materials in all indian languages and scratch editor should be available in cloud.\\n\\nhi natalie i think there hasn\\'t been anything by way of research topics --- but i am very interested in conducting research as it relates to the effect of using scratch on language development in children with disabilities as well as cogntivie growth in the same population. any resources or anyone willing to partner? we had a wonderful group at the unconference session for those working with children with disabilities at scratchmit2014 -- what paths or options for a)research opportunities b)research funding c) research through collaborative partnerships  are available?  i work only with children with hearing loss learning to listen and talk (no sign language) but am interested in research related to children with all types of disabilities\\n\\nhi, like ai boon tan i am just a \"scratcher\" interested in research others are conducting. recently i\\'ve joined a volunteer team at the \"rnib\" that supports their \"load2learn\" website so i just wondered about the use of \"scratch\" by visually impaired people/students.\\n\\ndear mates: audio slides scratch research https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axj18vifeh0&feature=youtu.be visual programming languages integrated across the curriculum in elementary school: a two year case study using scratch in five schools source: http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compedu.2016.03.003computers & education available online 10 march 2016\\n\\nhey, i\\'m scarlet and for quite some time i\\'ve been working with children (honestly speaking i never imagined myself being a teacher) but i\\'ve decided to work in a local orphanage. kids over there are so great but it is just a shame this orphanage isn\\'t equipt well. and for a couple of weeks i\\'ve been trying to teach these kids with scratched. well some enjoy it, some don\\'t. still, such creative projects do benefit kids, even those who don\\'t particularly like creative stuff. as to my research interests, that\\'s all about teaching techniques in elementary school as well as educational psychology. actually, i\\'m more interested into learning how our minds work and how to read a person (i\\'ve been doing research into this since college (this was my thesis topic at university of washington and i decided to continue researching it with research paper writings center) but when i was having my practical training in that orphanage i just couldn\\'t stop myself from spending a couple of hours per day or two with them.\\n\\nhi everyone. i am a masters student, doing applied research on effective scratch teaching methodologies for teaching computational thinking in papua new guinea. i\\'m planning to do surveys through both students and educators on the online scratch community.\\n\\n', '9830': \"the latest scratchnotes newsletter was sent out on may 28. scratchnotes a seasonal newsletter for the scratch educator community summer 2011 volume 2, issue 4 creative computing 2011 applications due june 1 supported by google's cs4hs initiative, we are pleased to offer a three-day creative computing workshop for k-12 teachers this summer. applications are due wednesday, june 1. slides, footage, and reflections from the 2009 workshop, 2010 workshop, and 2011 reunion are online. http://cs4hs.media.mit.edu/ final scratched meetup @ mit: saturday, june 18 we have been hosting scratch educator meetups at mit every 3rd saturday of the month since december 2010. the final meetup of the school year is taking place on saturday, june 18 - the monthly meetups will be on hiatus until september. sign up today to join us for this final meetup of the school year. http://www.eventbrite.com/event/1722121913/ june webinar: educator interviews want to learn more about educators' experiences with scratch in the classroom?

if have tried the first three and uploaded exe versions of my solutions ..... https://www.dropbox.com/sh/fbrnqg60qytz2sz/cogbwlprcn problem 1: multiplication `a la russe the standard multiplication algorithm taught in elementary schools represents just one of several ways to compute the product of two numbers. a different method, which was known in ancient egypt and is called multiplication `a la russe, more closely resembles how multiplication is performed in electronic computers. using this method, we need not refer to (or memorize) the standard multiplication table (which, for any two single-digit numbers, tells us their product). rather, we need to know how to do four things: add, decrement, double, and halve.using these four operations, we can characterize multiplication of two positive integers a and b as follows: develop a program that, given two positive integers, multiplies them according to this method and outputs their product as the sum of numbers obtained during the process. for the example above, this sum is 6 + 12 + 48 + 192 + 384. input: the first line contains a positive integer n indicating how many instances of the problem are described thereafter. each of the next n lines contains a pair of positive integers a and b to be multiplied, separated by a space. output: for each pair a and b given as input, display on a single line the equation a _ b = t1 + t2 +    + tr where the tis are the elements of the sum obtained by multiplying a and b using multiplication `a la russe. the tis should be in ascending order. resultant output ---------------- 214 * 3 = 6 + 12 + 48 + 192 + 384 1 * 3543 = 3543 3543 * 1 = 1 + 2 + 4 + 16 + 64 + 128 + 256 + 1024 + 2048 134 * 18 = 36 + 72 + 2304\\n\\n\\n\\n', '11009': 'the weekly roundup is where the scratched team shares some of the major -- as well as some of the overlooked -- news, stories, and events related to scratch that took place throughout the week. scratched weekly roundup 11/05/11 - 11/11/11 a special thanks to everyone who joined us at the scratch educator meetup last saturday at mit. you can find a recap, reflections and resources from the meetup here. -http://scratched.media.mit.edu/discussions/scratch-educator-meetups/reflections-scratch-educator-meetup-mit-saturday-november-05-20 the new york times featured an article on scratch entitled \"programming for children, minus cryptic syntax.\" -http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/10/technology/personaltech/computer-programming-for-children-minus-cryptic-syntax.html?scp=2&sq=scratch&st=cse alan o\\'donohoe is hosting hackademy, a family-oriented event in the uk where participants created video games in teams. read about the latest hackademy \\'after hours\\' event that took place this week.-http://teachcomputing.wordpress.com/2011/11/05/hackademy-after-hours-event-nov-4th-2011 find catalan-speakers, you can find out more about using scratch with the arduino here. -http://tecnobloc.wordpress.com/2011/11/06/scratch-for-arduino/?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter eduteka just released a spanish translation of \"big ideas\" document that describes some of the computational thinking concepts and learning approaches behind scratch.  -http://www.eduteka.org/modulos/9/284/1206/1 have you been using the new scratch curriculum guide?

typically all you have to do is peice all the right components together logically to create a solution to a problem. when creating complexsolutions in scratch, ihave had to create my own data structures. examples: using a one dimensional list like a two dimensional list to create a matrix using a list as a stack to store and idententies and locations of sprites which are shooting in a game using variables to store a unique identifiers so that a sprit can be identifed and dynamic messages can be created to manipulate a groups of sprites using list to store aid\\'s of active and inacvtive sprites working in scratch also demonstrates the difficulties in working with and syncronizing multiple threads of execution and the issues involved with variable access from multiple threads of execution. the limited (while at the same time powerful) nature of scratch forces one to examine the solution to a problem in fine detail and to create many things from scratch (no pun intended). for the first time in years i have found myself programming for pleasure. it is the challenge of finding solutions to complex problems and being able to examine the solutions that others have created in solving similar problems, that make workinginscratch so enjoyable. i am looking forward to aworkshop that iam giving to gt students on april 24th, 2010 and hope that at least one of my students gets

express is free. easy and powerful but quite proprietary and windows only some peoplemay notice a lack of languages with { } (c, c++, java, c#)because some of them are truly flawed (c, c++) and the

unfortunately, due to the short notice give out about the class, i only had two students plus my own daughter. after delivering my first scratch workshop i noted serveral items about the students experience in the class. scratch seemed natural to them. they immediately had a graps on dragging the language elements into a script. occasionally we had an bug which we all had fun trying to track down due to placement of a language element in the wrong location. sometimes with quite humorous results. ihad to double my time alotted to looking at the scratch websitebecause the students wanted to see as much as possible of what was out there. we did not have time to see all 1,000,000 projects :-) both or my students indicated that they would continueusing with scratch at home. we used scratch to build an aquarium simulator in a somewhat guided fashion and then the students were let go to either create their own project or remix another project from the scratch website. the topics covered were. the scratch interface creating and loading sprites changing the background when clicked forever loops if and if else touching touching random 1 to 2 move steps turn degrees say for 2 seconds play sound until done change y by publishing to the scratch website it was not possible in the time alotted towork with variables and messages although messaging was demonstrated and variables discussed at a high level. the students were given a three ring binder with the scratch manual and the scratch cards in hope of giving them enough tools to continue their exploration. i am currently looking within my school district for opportunities to either teach scratch to other students over an extendedperiod of time or to educators in a workshop setting.\\n\\non the subject of other learning environments, i\\'ve recently heard about scala ( http://www.scala-lang.org/), but i don\\'t know much about it. regarding the need to use scratch in ingenious ways to simulate features that are available in some other computer programming systems, yes, that is a fact. however, to include most of these features on a par with other scratch features would, i think, be giving beginners to much toworry about and sort through. perhaps some of these could be present, but if so, i think it is really important that the complexity introduced be carefully structured such that the environment offered to scratch beginners remains easy, natural and fairly complete. one of the things that scratch encourages is combining efforts. yet with the features within scratch,it can be hard tojust throw projects together and have something that works and is understandable. the skill and perception required to combine projects can be much higher than that required to write the individual projects. perhaps there are some clever integration techniques that could be added, since community projects seems to be an important aspect of the scratch message.\\n\\nwhat i really wish scratch had is the features in the byob 2 version of scratch www.chirp.scratchr.org/blog/ or better yet the features of byob 3byob.berkeley.edu/. i think with the features availiable in byob the jump to higher languages would be easier and could be delayed because there would enough there to teach some of the higher concepts of computing (like recursion). i really, really like scratch but i think some of the emphasis areas in 2.0 are off the mark. idon\\'t think we need connectivity to facebook and twitter (egads !), i think we need a slight improved environment to teach cs concepts. but then being a computer scientist, i am a little biased.\\n\\nto add to toby\\'s list, i\\'d suggest looking at greenfoot. it\\'s a java programming environment that provides a framework with a stage and sprites (\"actors\") so you can quickly build interactive games or stories like those can build in scratch. but the code is real java -- complex syntax and all -- and you can use all the java api\\'s. another cool language is javascript. it\\'s interactive, fairly simple, and it\\'s built into most browsers. i haven\\'t looked for any step-by-step tutorials, but i\\'m sure they must exist. by the way, scratch *is* programming. while scratch doesn\\'t require that you master the syntax of a text-based programming language, the program logic is exactly the same as c, java, python. in fact, scratch is used in courses at harvard, the college of new jersey, and elsewhere as an introduction to those languages. from all reports, scratch works very well in these courses because its constructs *are* so similar to other languages. -- john\\n\\ni do lots and lots and lots of javascript at my \"real\" job. i also do quite a bit of java and c#, too. java and c# are enough alike that if you write java code with a \"c\"-like syntax, it will probably become c#, more or less. (sure, i\\'m skipping over some differences such as delegates and anonymous functions, etc.) javascript (more properly ecmascript these days) is very different in practice than either of those. it\\'s more interpretive and less strongly-typed. javascript is easy to write and hard to debug, which i think is the opposite of what beginners need (and even often us pros, i think). in my opinion, there aren\\'t any really effective debuggers for javascript. the closest ones are firebug and myeclipse, but it is still not like the relevant, right-on-top-of-it, debugging of visual studio for c# and visual basic or eclipse for java. i\\'m sure there are several interesting environments around like scala and the ones you mention that i haven\\'t really checked out. but if you want to have fun learning programming with an accepted \"professional\" langauge, i think one viable possibility is to use microsoft\\'s c#/xna. it\\'s free and you can even run your code on the xbox (with xbox membership cost). there\\'s even a community. tutorials abound. just google a phrase like: c# xnatutorial . some are for those with experience. some video tutorials are for beginners and most are oriented around making games. and if you don\\'t like being in the microsoft world, remember that nearly all of your c# skills transfer very well to java. that said, c#/xna is an adventure more for an interested high-schooler than the casual 2nd-5th grade scratchers that i teach. regarding an earlier discussion, i personally don\\'t worry much about whether one learns recursion, but i think that object-oriented programming is an important concept. some of that comes through in scratch, partly from its smalltalk heritage. i miss things like creating objects on the fly more than i miss recursion. i even miss such niceties as passing parameters or being able to direct a \"broadcast\" to a more specific audience of listeners. i think that these latter two features, though, could be added to scratch in an optional, structured way that would not hurt the simplicity and clarity of scratch as we know it.\\n\\ni agree that in naming missing elements that are missing from scratch, recursion is probably a poor choice. that being said. byob is really cool. it definitely addresses additional computing concepts without adding a huge number of new language elements. they have a \"video\" that demonstrates what byob 3 does and it is well worth a look. even if these elements never make it into the official scratch, byob is still there.the only real drawback is students lose the ability to publish to the web. i totally agree that scratch is a real programming environment. i have not had this much fun creating software in years ! now if i could only figure out a way to make a living teaching scratch to students or educators, i\\'d be set !\\n\\nhelp me understand more of the programming concepts you mention: what are passing parameters, and how is \"creating an object on the fly\" different than programming a sprite?\\n\\npassing parameters (sometimes called arguments): in mathematics, this would resemble in many ways a function call. i\\'ll try to do a scratch-like example: let\\'s say we had a project with some fish in an aquarium and we wanted to tell them to change their color. in scratch now, we could make up broadcast messages such as \"fish turn green\", \"fish turn red\", \"fish turn blue\", etc. we\\'d have a different broadcast message for each color. if there were lots of colors that we wanted to have the fish become, we\\'d have a lot of messages. and if there was a situation where we couldn\\'t anticipate what color we wanted for the fish, we\\'d be in trouble because we can\\'t just define a new broadcast message \"on the fly\". but both of these problems would go away if we could attach \"parameters\" to a broadcast message. i\\'m inventing syntax here, but for instance perhaps scratch could let us say: broadcast \"fish change color\" with \"green\" or broadcast \"fish change color\" with \"blue\". or even better broadcast \"fish change color\" with \"variable: favorite color\". then we need only one broadcast message and we are able to create variations of the same message by using parameters. now you can simulate this to a large degree now by having a variable that hold the new fish color and making the broadcast message say: \"fish, look at the new fish color now\". that has much the same effect, but it is a two step process and in some ways is harder to follow in the code. creating objects \"on the fly\": let\\'s say that we made a project where we asked the player \"how many lightning bugs would you like to see flying around randomly?\". they\\'d say some number and then what would we do? well, if we had made enough lighting bug sprites to match their largest possible number, we could just \"show\" the appropriate number and \"hide\" the others. but that is sort of a pain because we have to make a large number of sprites and set up a script for each one. it would be much easier if we could just say, in effect, \"clone a new lighting bug sprite just like (the original sprite name goes here).\" in object-oriented programming, we would call this an \"instance\" of the \"lightning bug sprite object\". so now the number of sprites that we have on the screen is no longer limited to the number that we define before running our project.\\n\\nfrom what i\\'ve read, cloning was intentionally left out due to either the intentional or unintentional create of a sorcerer\\'s apprentice project that create a large number of sprites and the side effect being using up all availiable ram.\\n\\nparameters are a fairly fundamental facility in almost all computer languages. an example of a parameter is the values that a block takes to decribe what it does, like turn degrees ( being a parameter). it would be nice to be able to send parameters in messages broadcasts or by some other facility. creating an object on the fly would be defining say \"sprite 1\" and then having blocks in the program that says make me another sprite just like \"sprite 1\". this would create a new sprite that acts just like the old sprite but is an entirely new sprite. unfortunately this would open up a sorcerer\\'s apprentice situation where a large number of sprites could be created which would crash the java applet and comsume a large amount of availiable ram.\\n\\n', '12306': \"the weekly roundup is where the scratched team shares some of the major -- as well as some of the overlooked -- news, stories, and events related to scratch that took place throughout the week. scratched weekly roundup 03/24/12 - 03/30/12 don't miss the april scratch educator meetup next saturday. april 7. join us at mit from 10am to 1pm to network, share, and learn more about scratch with local educators. our monthly meetups are free, include lunch, and can count toward pdp hours.meet up with us! - http://apr2012meetup.eventbrite.com missed last week's scratch 2.0 preview duringscratched webinar wednesday?

our school district is good, and the kids are sharp, but will they be able to do anything at all in scratch given the constrained nature of the program? and, if i take this on, i only have 3 weeks to prepare, with little spare time due to my regular teaching and research commitments - are there resources out there aimed at this age group? i don\\'t have any experience teaching kids except for working with my own. i know i would need appropriate projects and materials in order to do this since i don\\'t have the expertise or time to develop anything. is this a really bad idea, or is it a good idea to take this on? thanks, bonnie mackellar\\n\\ni think this is a really good idea. :) have you seen the scratch curriculum guide?\\n\\nhi, yes, that was one of the first things i looked at. it seems like it is aimed at college students, or advanced high school students though. it is definitely way too much and too serious for an elementary afterschool club. also, all i could find was a large word document that refers to handouts. am i missing something? thanks, bonnie\\n\\ni agree that there\\'s additional structure that doesn\\'t make sense for afterschool, but the activities (e.g. handouts that are located at the end of the guide) can work. i ran an afterschool program for 4th and 5th graders that use the activities in the guide -- something surprising, all about me, dance party, etc. -- not as prescribed activities, but as potential activities for kids to work on. i\\'d show a small aspect of scratch, then let people loose to work on their own projects. something that has also worked well for me is to show a little each session, point kids to the scratch online community or to the scratch cards. hope that helps!\\n\\nwe won\\'t be able to use the online community unfortunately! that isn\\'t allowed in our district. i will check out the scratch cards. thanks!\\n\\nhi, if you show them the fundamentals in a 30 minute session and let them loose, they will come up with something good i introduced the basics of scratch to my son when he was about 9 years old. after quickly understanding the basics, he wrote a simple point and shoot program, 2 wizards, one pointing to the other shouts \"shrikizio\" and the other shrinks. he then added a bit of interaction, letting one move while the other tried to shoot. this is outright harry potter copy, but still interesting.\\n\\nthanks for all the helpful advice. unfortunately, the word just came down from the district it office that we can\\'t run this program because they won\\'t allow scratch to be installed on the school computers. i may try to meet with them to convince them that it would be ok, so we could do the club next year. however, it is now too late for this year. very sad.\\n\\nhi bonnie - so sad! do you think they don\\'t understand what scratch is? is such an easy, small, free application to install. best of luck getting scratch in your district. if you get the chance to get this going, i agree with what others i have said. i have an afterschool scratch club with about 30 students grades 3-7. i rely heavily on the scratch cards (i have 20 sets), and the sample projects from the curriculum guide. i printed those out in color and laminated a bunch to have for project starters for students. i\\'ve also done 3 minute challenges where we toss out an idea and everyone tries to do it in 3 minutes, sharing successful projects. an important thing to keep in mind is having a goal to build towards - we share our projects at the math carnival night in march as well as at art night in may. we\\'ve also had a share day where parents are invited to the club to view student projects - we had half the students sharing at a time so the students had the chance to view each other\\'s work.\\n\\nhi bonnie, that\\'s too bad. i also ran into the same road block when i tried to get a scratch club started at my son\\'s middle school (6-8th grades) one spring. it\\'s very hard to get schools to change anything in the middle of the year, and i was asking them to install a \\'beta\\' version too which was viewed with suspicion. however, at the end of that school year i recruited support from a teacher in the school, and over the summer we got them to install scratch on the computers, and started the club the following fall. that was six years ago, and the scratch club is still going strong (and the principal promotes it to incoming 5th graders when they visit!). so my advice would be to start asking for scratch to be put on computers at the end of this school year, and to keep asking over the summer. if you wait until august they will probably have already decided what updates they\\'re doing and it may be too late. good luck! --chris\\n\\nhi can you not run scratch from usb pen drives ? it means then that scratch is not being installed on any pc\\'s and i am sure you would be able to get help with donations of usb\\'s to do so anywhere. amanda\\n\\ni\\'ve never tried that. has anyone here run scratch from usb drives successfully? i am trying to find out what the objection was. unfortunately, i am hearing this secondhand from the club coordinator. my guess is that she didn\\'t know how to explain scratch to the it people. she is the one who recruited me, largely because she heard that another school district was doing this. i think i will try to meet with the it people over the summer and work with them. i work with our it people at my university all the time, so i sort of know their language. thanks!\\n\\nbonnie yes its easy to use, i carry one about with me. i just iinstall scratch onto the usb pen, it means when i am going into a school for the first time i can show them without have to worry about installation. good luck with your project :) amanda\\n\\nbonnie, sorry to hear about that. seems like a rash decision made by individuals who do not understand what this program is about. this is developed by the leading institution for technology in the world and is aimed to provide children with and easy to use and understand tool to nurture thier creativity and reinforce their computational reasoning. do they really have a problem with a program develop and maintained by mit? it is not like some shady commercial developer. sorry...something i am passionate about. anyway i am starting a afterschool club at our elementary school. if i find anything interesting or helpful i will be sure to pass it along.\\n\\ni think it\\'s a really good idea too. i have been teaching scratch to 4th, 5th and 6th grade computer students this year at a public school in fl. they love it! i can incorporate geometry, storytelling, game design or whatever and they learn iteration, variables, boolean logic. it\\'s been a great success and many of them have downloaded scratch at home and sent me their creations.\\n\\ni\\'m looking at starting a 4th/5th grade scratch club next year too! it\\'s great to see that i\\'m in good company. can anyone point me in the direction of some quality examples of scratch projects made by actual 4th and 5th graders? when we go class to class to pitch the club, i\\'d really like to be able to say, \"someone your age made this!\", you know? it\\'s one thing for me to show off something i made and try to tell them it\\'s fun - i\\'m a boring grownup now.\\n\\nhi eileen, nancy costa is a 3rd-5th grade educator and her students have created wonderful aesop fables scratch projects.she also presented some of the projects at a scratch educator meetup last year. you can watch video of the show & tell presentation here. patrice gans is also another educator that works with 4th and 5th graders. you can view some of her students\\' work here. those are only two examples, but there are many other elementary educators on scratched. you might try searching for \"4th\" or \"5th\" on scratched or filter for members who have indicated \"elementary\" education as part of their interests. hope that helps! michelle on behalf of the scratched team\\n\\n', '22212': \"i don't know if anyone has had this problem, but one of my students does not get a number when he shares his project. it saves by it doesn't assign a number for his project. if you have had this problem, please let me know. thank you,\\n\\n\", '29353': 'this year, a team of scratch educators (ingrid gustafson, janet dee, and rosemary slattery) are organizing and hosting the monthly meetups, with financial support from the scratched team at hgse. the first meetup of the school year is next saturday, september 27 from 10am to 1pm, at the kennedy-longfellow school in cambridge, courtesy of the cambridge public schools. as always, the meetups are free, and include lunch and parking. register now at http://scratched-cambridge.eventbrite.com and help spread the word -- we look forward to seeing you at the meetup! if you have any questions, you can contact the meetup organizers at scratched.cambridge@gmail.com or the scratched team at scratched@gse.harvard.edu\\n\\n', '26706': \"is there a way for 3 students to share a project, all have rights to edit and change without remixing?

(that save your work part is the difference between bravery and lunacy :p)... good luck!!! al\\n\\nal- i see examples of the \"for loop\" in the byob manual, but it is not one of the standard control commands for either scratch nor byob. do you have to make it?\\n\\nhello again- haven\\'t used byob much in my classes yet, just scratch. i did locate the tutorial 1 that describes how to build a for loop. although i did follow the instructions, and my code appeared to be correct, i could never get the loops to stop regardless of whether they went up or down. not the kind of thing i want to start my students off with.\\n\\nit is so useful you will want to make it! besides you will learn a ton about building your own blocks in the process and that will help you with encapsulation in your later projects... go to the variables tab and select \"make a block\" (gray button at the bottom) select \"control\" as your category - choosing a category will determine where your created block appears later, so pick something that will sort it where you want it leave command type and \"for all sprites\" selected in the text area type \"for %i = %begin to %end %action\" - anything you precede with a percent sign is a variable when you hit enter it will take you to the block editor, from here we will modify each variable click on the variable \"i\" and then in the \"edit input name\" dialog choose the little black triangle on the far right - this is where you set properties and validations for your input variables for \"i\" check the checkbox \"make the internal variable visible to caller\" - this will make it so you can access the variable i inside the for loop go into the properties of begin and end and give them default values (1 and 10) do the same thing for action and select the checkbox for c-type now for the code of the block: (someone seems to have revoked my ability to upload images...so iwill describe it to you) set [ i v]to (begin) repeat until < (i) > (end) > run action change [ i v]by (1) hope that makes sense... good luck! al\\n\\noops- seem to be getting my replies in the wrong places. down below iadded that i found the tutorial on how to make one. still haven\\'t found out why mine never stops even though the two seem the same. update: deleted everything that was done in the website tutorial 1, created one of my own, and now everything works. mine now counts eitherpositive or negativedepending on the initial initial values of start/finish. thanks for the support. thinking on creating one with a step value in case i want to skip values. :)\\n\\nhi al, thanks. i am really enjoying programming in scratch. i\\'m a grandmother so i\\'mhoping to pass my enthusiasm on to my grandchildren. thanks so much, anne\\n\\nlet me first state, all of this is self-taught, so the byob gurus may have different (a.k.a. correct)terminology for things. iam probably not too far off the mark however. if things go wonky that is an opportunity for you to learn the debugger....throw a debug block at the top of your execution chain and when you run you will be dropped in to the debugger (ok, no fancy breakpoints, inspectors, manipulation, in fact it is a pretty sad little debugger, but it is better than nothing at all!) the button on the left is \"run\" which is basically your \"i\\'m done button\". the one on the right with the arrow pointing to a flat line is your \"step into\" and it is your bread and butter (later on you may see a double chevron to the right of that which is your \"step over/out\" which will allow you to jump over blocks you have created, but ido not wish to confuse things so ignore that for now) the arrow pointing to the line is the one we will be using...each time you click it, it will show you a block of code and then it will drill down to the inner most function call/variable... when you reach the inner most value it will show it on the screentwice. the first time is so you know what block is being evaluated, the second time is after evaluation. if you click the variables button, it will allow you to inspect local variables by placing your mouse over the variable name in the list and waiting for a little popup with the value inside. if a value has just been evaluated, at the top there will be a \"report value\" and a mouseover there will give you the evaluated result. it is a little confusing at first when it jumps inside a block you created (like the for loop), but if you play with it a bit you will get comfortable with it. you can easily follow the flow to determine why your loop is never ending (did you not use a negative number in your \"change variable by n\"block?) you should be able to see that kind of error here. good luck! al\\n\\nthanks again al- had fun watching the debugger. the problem i encountered was with the tutorial author\\'s use of the \"the block\" in his video. quite simply, i could never get it to work using the call() as described in the video because i failed to put the \"repeat until call(test)\" in , just a \"repeat until(test)\". my bad :( i used an alternative method for my students that didn\\'t require \"the block\", and moved on, but backed up and showed them this way also. a minor problem that test subjects in my highschool class encountered was trying to understand exactly what the \"run[action]\" actually did. that helped me to some extent, because i could then explain that the \"actions\" were going to be all of the commands that would eventually reside inside ofthe for loop c-block that this code generates, and the current value of \"i\" would be passed to thosecommandsupon each iteration. it also gave me a chance to demonstrate what happens if you switch the order of the \"run[action]\" and \"set (i)\" commands. life is good, sometimes better if fully understood ;-)\\n\\n', '2644': 'i am writinga universitypaper and am looking for some feedback... is anyone struggling with the conflict between letting students create and explore on their own versus ensuring that you are covering specific state-mandated objectives. i like the idea of giving my students some freedom to express themselves and explore on their own, but each day we spend doing this i know i am falling farther and farther behind in terms of covering the objectives i am expected to cover. how are other people dealing with this issue? thank you for your input\\n\\nin a word, yes! you nailed the challenge. figuring out how to do both has me looking for ways to integrate scratch (and other creative projects) as a means to get at state objectives. how can scratch be a tool in for how we teach what we are required to teach? what is your context? my math class just used scratch to explore similarity as part of a textnbook chapter . i thought about skipping the scratch because we are behind the pacing guide, but scolded myself about covering distance vs. teaching so kids get it.  i did simplify the projct. it added three days to the unit, and now they understand coordinates and scale factors a whole lot better. karen r\\n\\ni have been able to create several projects that address specific state objectives; however, often times they seem contrived. i have gotten to the point where i think perhaps we\\'ve been going at it backwards. instead of the \"real world\" conforming to our state objectives, perhaps the objectives need to be reevaluated to meet the needs of the real world.\\n\\nhi im using scratch with primary children in the uk (for my honours project)i have managed to use some maths ojbectives from the curriculum as well as the computing science and combine them. my lessons are structured so that the kids can get a bit of time at the end to explore on their own.\\n\\nafek i have been using scratch with 2nd grade for 3 years now. we do a unit where the children animate a folk tale. over the course of the unit they have a lot of creative freedom but the assignment also keeps them focused on literacy objectives. i think good inquiry projects always involves a balance. they need to be focused enough so that the children know what to do and certain objectives are met. they also need to be open enough so that children can express their creativity.\\n\\n', '12449': 'hi all, i\\'ve been using byob to teach a college level programming course this semester. i focus on using the parts of the language that can be leveraged to do neat things simply. therefore, dynamic cloning and deletion is attractive. at some point, i showed how you can do just a bit more with dynamic cloning and deletion by using a variable. in particular, i used examples where sprites are dynamically cloned but the variable they all share is updated in some way, so each of the clones can have distinct behaviors based on one, or at most two, variables. i have two questions: 1) why is sending messages so verbose when it is so fundamental in smalltalk and that fundamentalness should carry over to byob ? btw, i have just said about all i know of smalltalk in the last sentence so i may be confused. would it make more sense to have a dedicated message sending block instead of overloading the \"of\" block in such a way? 2) why does the \"of\" block have to be in a launch block instead of a report block? launch (the script (set age to 3)) of (clone) results in a clone with its age set correctly to 3. however, report (the script (set age to 3)) of (clone) results in a clone that still shares its age with its parent. i think this is a question about semantics. i\\'m familiar with all sorts of pl semantics, but i\\'m pretty confused about byob semantics. thanks for your help. - mulhern\\n\\n> would it make more sense to have a dedicated message sending block instead of overloading the \"of\" block in such a way? i

one of its blocks. i\\'m packing up a little bunch of my code and telling another sprite to run that. i\\'m not sure what i would suggest, but that \"of\" block is awkwardly overloaded and counter-intuitive. if it\\'s the one thing that i have to tell my students, \"yes, this is how it works, it is wierd, you\\'ll just have to roll with it\", then it maybe should be considered to be a candidate for tweeking. are you able to address the \"it\\'s easy in smalltalk, why so awkward in snap!?\" question at all. >> why does the \"of\" block have to be in a launch block instead of a report block? > if you click on the \"the script (set age to 3)) of (clone)\" script, you will see, as a result, a script. so, by inserting this script inside report, you will just pass this script around, you won\\'t execute it in any way. instead, by using launch or run, you will ask the clone to actually run this script, so the variable will be really set. i am well aware that the \"the script\" block reifies the code inside it, so it is not necessary to explain that to me. i am quite fond of languages with first class functions and pass them around like mad whenever the opportunity arises. but i\\'m not inserting the script inside the report or launch block. i\\'m inserting it inside the \"of\" block. it is the \"of\" block that may be inserted inside a report or launch block as the case may be. the \"of\" block itself is not reified. after some thought, i realize that i have the answer and it\\'s almost obvious. the \"of\" block is executed, because it\\'s an argument to the launch block. the \"of\"block evaluates to the value (the script (set age to 3)). during evaluation the major side effect is that a clone is created. the value of the expression, i.e., the script is passed as an argument to the launch block. somehow, in the process, this value is tagged as applying to the particular sprite that just got cloned, so when the launch block is executed it executes that script for the cloned sprite. this is not a process i really want to be explaining to my students in the fifth week of class, yet message passing itself is alluring. the ownership of a script is not shown in byobin any way. so, if i set the variable f to the result of (the script (set age to 3) of (clone)) and i then click on x to see its value, i see the script, but not the fact that it belongs to the particular sprite that just got cloned. this still means that \"of\\'is overloaded a little bizarrely, because the code is assigned to the object on the right hand side of the \"of\\'. that is not the usual meaning of \"of\" and doesn\\'t match up well with the suggested values in the drop down menu, like x-position. i think iwould like a single tell block for message passing. here is an instance of its use. tell clone to (the script (set age to 3)) it is not general, but it is nice and simple. i could, of course, write such a thing myself for when i teach my class next year, but then i would have to make sure my class loaded that particular block all the time,which adds overhead.\\n\\nif i correctly understand your suggestion (in which case i completely agree with you) by creating the tell block you would move the \"of\" to the launch block, that is, instead of launch ((the script (set age to 3)) of (clone)) you would like something link launch (the script (set age to 3)) of (clone) i admit that when you evaluate the of block the reference to the sprite completely disappear. this is not necessary in scratch (as the result is simpy a value) but if you are able to execute that very result by using a launch/run block, then the reference to the sprite should be somewhere. currently this is too opaque. to me your proposal is fine. even if, for my porposes of \"natural\" or \"spontaneous\" programming (that i strongly support), the entire launch block is really too much (and i don\\'t explain it to my students). indeed, when you think to sprites as real animated entities, you will never have the possibily to impose another sprite to do something. the correct mechanism, at least in my theoretical programming environment, would be sending the sprite a message (hopefully with parameters). if the sprite is willing to accept that request it will be equipped by a suitable \"receive\" block. this is what i would strongly support. instead, brian and jens, that support more powerful and flexible programming languages, immediately refused my view. my goal is the same of yours: if you make it easier to understand (and to me what is closer to the real world is easier) students will learn it sooner and use it better.\\n\\nhi anne, thanks for these thoughtful and \"real life\" remarks about the issues you encountered teaching oop with byob. it\\'s very exciting for us that you\\'re pressing ahead in pioneering a college level programming course based on byob! i share your concerns in part about overloading the of block. otoh instead of sending a textual message which resolves to a method (-name) in the receiver byob sends blocks (and scripts). personally i think that\\'s easier to understand (and to visualize) than having to somehow get a textual handle for blocknames, which would also have to include further (textual) syntax for parameters etc. however, when a sprite sends \"a block\" to another sprite, it sometimes doesn\\'t know whether such a block even exists for the receiver. in a textual language such as smalltalk this doesn\\'t really matter, because a message is after all just a string, and if it doesn\\'t match with one of the receiver\\'s own or inherited methods the receiver just answers #doesnotunderstand. in a blocks based language the equivalent to a method name is the \"block shape\" (or block prototype, as we call it), and the equivalent of the method itself is the block\\'s definition body, i.e. the script attached to the prototype\\'s hat block in the block editor. therefore, in the of block we\\'re asking the receiving sprite to identify a block \"such as this one\" indicated by one the sender itself knows about. for future versions of snap we\\'re considering a more generic way to describe \"block shapes\", so that they can be sent to other sprites even if the sender doesn\\'t already have a similar-looking block itself. does this all make sense? oh, one more thing: this way of having to call (or run/launch) a block answered by the receiver certainly isn\\'t self explanatory. that\\'s why - foreseeing this difficulty - we put explicit tell (obj) (action) ask (obj) for (reporter) blocks in our tools sprite. these blocks should be pretty much exactly what you\\'re suggesting, right? we\\'re thinking about always loading them whenever snap is launched, but still letting users open a block editor on them so they can demystify message passing for themselves by looking at the - surprisingly simple - implementation code. do you think this would help you and your students? thanks! -jens\\n\\ni\\'ll take the blame for this one. my sense of what\\'s elegant doesn\\'t always match that of normal people. :-/ it\\'s exactly right that we were trying to minimize the number of new blocks in the (hopeless) quest to convince the scratch team to incorporate our ideas in scratch 2.0. and, if you think about just the original scratch ofblock, what it\\'s doing is precisely message passing. \"xposition\" is a message (a text string), and \"sprite2\"is [the name of, since they\\'re not first class in scratch] an object. so it seemed most elegant to me, since we were already handed a message passing block, to use that block for all message passing. we added the telland askblocks to the tool sprite because we quickly learned that other people didn\\'t find the generalized of as elegant as istill do. :-( if we provide telland askon startup, will you mind that they\\'re implemented using of? you don\\'t have to teach it to your students. about run/launchvs. call, this issue has nothing to do with oop. we inherit from scratch the fact that some blocks report a value, while others don\\'t. the former are oval or hexagonal; the latter are jigsaw-shaped. this is why we have theblockand thescriptinstead of a single lambda, and it\\'s why, correspondingly, you calla reporter block but you run a script (which might be a single command block). launchis just a variant of run that starts a new thread, like broadcastvs. broadcastandwait respectively. it\\'s convenient to use launchwith message-passing, but you can launcha new thread within a single sprite. about byobvs. smalltalk, what ithink is that part of the genius of scratch was to finesse the distinction between a procedure and its name -- to a kid, \"the move10 stepsblock\" and \"the \\'move10 steps\\' block\" mean the same thing. if you view a message as being the name of a method, this means that in scratch it\\'s really hard to make a distinction between message and method. a block is its own name. almost all the time, in scratch, this unproblematically lets kids get on with writing programs without having to think at all about the language semantics. but in byob it sometimes makes it harder to express oneself precisely. jens, did iget this right? inote in passing that some scratch block names are quite long, and you\\'d get tired of typing \"glide_secstox:_y:_\" as a message after a while. using the reified block as its own message /is/ terse and simple, looked at from the right angle. :-) we are about to rethink all this for snap! because we want to generalize the oopsystem to include other kinds of objects, e.g., costumes and sounds. if we keep the same message passing approach, we\\'ll be overloading the second input of ofas well as the first. nothing is settled yet. but we\\'ll certainly provide askand tell (we need both for the same reason as calland run) on startup.\\n\\nthanks jens. i appreciate all the hard work on byob/snap!. it\\'s been a very interesting experience teaching with byob and i don\\'t think the class would have been nearly as successful in another language. we switched to python a few weeks ago and students who had been doing well in byob spun out when attempting programs of equal difficulty in python. wrestling with syntax seems to get in the way of higher level thinking. i would have liked to continue with byob further but i was running out of simple and elegant things that i felt i had a thorough understanding of, so i decided i\\'ld better switch to another language i had strong opinions on the proper use of before i started to flounder ;> i\\'ll have to spend a little time reflecting on what you\\'ve said here before i can give a response. will you be at scratch@mit this summer? i\\'ld like to get the chance to talk to you in person and show you the materials i\\'ve been working on. - mulhern\\n\\nhave you then decided to give up on the hopeless quest and make use of the freedom that provides?\\n\\na qualified yes. for one thing, we\\'re going to split up the old tool sprite into modules, and one of those subsets will be preloaded when you start snap!. so you\\'ll have telland ask(one command, one reporter, sorry) but they\\'ll still be implemented with of, the basic message passing block. another example is that people keep wanting support for various neat hardware accessories, from nxt to arduino to knect. but idon\\'t want to have to keep adding half a dozen primitive blocks whenever a new toy is invented; instead, iwant to work out how to design primitive blocks read-from-usband send-to-usb in terms of which people can write libraries for each device. we\\'ll probably (although this isn\\'t settled and there are competing design ideas) split callwithinputsand callwithinputlist into two blocks instead of squeezing them into one block with a pulldown. so, yes, you\\'ll see a modest increase in the number of primitives, but you won\\'t see exponential growth. ps:ianj, but i\\'ll be at scratch@mit and would love to get together about curriculum!\\n\\n>the ownership of a script is not shown in byob in any way. so, if i set the variable f to the result of (the script (set age to 3) of (clone)) and i then click on x to see its value, i see the script, but not the fact that it belongs to the particular sprite that just got cloned. this is an issue we inherit from scratch, although the difficulties aren\\'t as obtrusive in scratch. take the move10 stepsblock. to everyone except jens and john maloney, this seems to be one universal block. but in fact that\\'s not how scratch thinks about it. actually each sprite has its own local move10 stepsblock. the outward notation would be a better fit to the actual internal mechanism if the block were labelled movesprite4 10 steps etc. so, even primitive blocks should really have a mechanism to show which sprite they belong to. as soon as things slow down (\"real soon now,\"as we used to say in the mitscience fiction society) we\\'ll design a serious debugger, which will have the ability to display the owner of any block/script, primitive or user-created. with oop it\\'s even a little more complicated since a sprite can inherit (share) a block owned by its parent. even without thinking about objects, a very similar situation arises when we display the text of a procedure to represent the procedure; that leaves out the defining environment, from which the procedure may get access to local state variables (e.g., for a thescriptinside a custom block). you just have to allow that the displayed representation of a value may not include every attribute of that value. when you evaluate an expression whose value is a sprite (in byob3.1), what you see is a speech balloon containing a picture of the sprite\\'s costume. you don\\'t see its position, or, more importantly, the values of its local variables. you need a debugger for that.\\n\\n', '13757': 'brief notes from

susan swan summary we organized the 4-hour workshop around sessions #1 and #2 of the new scratch curriculum guide. each participant received a copy of the curriculum guide at the beginning of the workshop. after breakfast and introductions, karen brennan presented an overview of scratch and creative computing, followed by the something surprising activity. next, following session #2 of the curriculum guide, michelle chung introduced the \"about me\" interactive collage activity centered around a halloween theme. the group brainstormed project ideas about childhood memories of halloween, and then, michelle showed one way to get started by starting to build an example project on the large screen in front of the group. next, everyone was given 40 minutes of uninterrupted hands-on time to explore their own \"spooky memories\" projects. we then held an impromptu show & tell session to check-in on everyone\\'s progress and discuss the curriculum guide, followed by a second, 30-minute build session. the workshop ended with karen sharing resources and strategies for next steps. show & tell during show & tell, each person shared their progress and talked about their process. we asked each participant: what are you most proud of? what was most challenging? or is there something you\\'re currently stuck on? resources here are resources that were shared during the workshop: new

https://fatherinastrangeland.wordpress.com/2012/10/17/scratch-programming-workshop-at-tedxyouthflanders-2012/\\n\\n', '3770': 'hi! i\\'m wondering whether any of the teachers here have had negative experiences with their students and the scratch community and how they have handled it. what happened to me on the surface doesn\\'t seem that strong compared to what goes on elsewhere on the internet but it has dampened and tarnished scratch at our school. i am hoping that others might help me know how best to respond to the situation, since i am just a volunteer teacher and my experience at classroom teaching is limited. iwas the one toset up teaching scratch at my school. i had each student in 2-5 set up a scratch account using their first name only followed by the initial of our school. i asked them not to post their photos and to mindful that things were somewhat public online. it didn\\'t occur to me that perhaps i should have gathered permission from parents ahead of time. it didn\\'t seem much different to me, in concern, than having the students access national geographic and similar sites online. there are only about fifty students in the entire school and the other teachers are not very involved with computers so, although they had heard me rave about scratch, they probably did not think too much about it later and thought, i found out later, that i had more control of the situation than i actually could have. overall, the students have been very enthusiastic about scratch and some do it at home as well, which i basically thought was a good thing. however, for whatever reason, one of the older boys commented on a project of another scratch student somewhere in the usa saying that their project was \"lame\". i don\\'t know whether he made this comment from home or while he was in my classroom. the first i heard about it was when i found the teachers and students very upset that the student at the other school had, in return, posted a comment to my student\\'s project containing mild profanities at the quality of my student\\'s project. i was called on the carpet by the teachers that operate the school. they couldn\\'t believe that i would expose the students to something where they might receive comments like this. they also couldn\\'t believe that i would put the students in a situation where i wasn\\'t reviewing each comment they received before they could read it. i was told that the situation was completely unacceptable and that the parents would never tolerate it. we were on vacation break for a week and today i submitted a parent approval form for scratch which i had put together, referring to the website and speaking of the benefits of the program, explaining how the community operated in a generally positive manner and asking their permission. i gave the form to the head teacher and she said that she needed time to review it with the other teachers andi am to refrain from teaching scratch until the other teachers come to a decision. i\\'m not really a participating member of the teachers\\' group since i am just a volunteer teacher two mornings a week. in the past, i think i have generally been on good terms with the regularteachers, so i will wait and hope that we will be able to continue using scratch in some form. how have the rest of you handled situations like this? i feel really terrible about doing anything negative towards the students, particularly on issues concerning safety and self-esteem. my wife, who has much more teaching experience than me, though compared it like this. what if my student on the playground had yelled out through the fenceto some driver passing by that their driving was lame? then perhaps that driver might respond with a curse or similar. in this case the driver would actually have seen the student. would the playground supervisor be responsible and in what way? are there some materials on a scratch site that might give me some guidance on issues with classroom safety and parents? thanks.\\n\\nhi bruce i believe the terms and conditions require a student to be 13 years old to have an account. what i do with my students is upload their work to my own account. this way i can also better monitor any comments made (though that is not perfect). for the most part this cuts back on the negative commenting since it is posted on a teacher\\'s account. i do get permission from the parents before uploading their work to the website. i also explain the age requirements for opening an account and that parents must be the responsible adult at home to monitor the account if they open one. finally i discuss with the students that there will always be a few \"malcontents\" out there who will make negative comments \"just because\" and they shouldn\\'t take it personally. i have been an elementary school teacher for 32 years and find scratch to be a wonderful program for my students. it\\'s unfortunate that the teachers in your school have reacted in such a negative way to this situation. hang in there and try to win them over by showing them how much students gain. perhaps you might consider sharing my lesson plan on animating aesops fables and my student\\'s work so they might see what the possibilities are for expanding their own teaching. i think it will be self-evident to any good teacher and you won\\'t have to do much convincing. http://scratch.mit.edu/galleries/view/37347 http://teachersnetwork.org/grantwinners/teachnet09_nancycosta.htm best of luck, nancy\\n\\nhi bruce, i\\'m sorry to hear about your experience with your students using the scratch site! i think the scratch site is full of great opportunities for sharing creations, meeting other creators, and learning more about scratch -- but that\\'s not to say there aren\\'t any problems. as you point out in your message, some of those problems are part of life online. (and interactions with people more generally, thinking about your driver example!) in my experiences of talking to a wide variety of teachers about this subject, some teachers/schools are willing to tolerate some of the problems and treat them as opportunities to learn about interacting with others and self-representation online. other teachers/schools say that problems cannot be tolerated -- and don\\'t permit accessing the scratch site from school. of course, there are things to try other than the kids having their own accounts -- like you posting the projects through a central account, as nancy suggests. (just a clarification, it\\'s fine for someone under 13 to have an account, but they need to provide a parent/guardian email address.) i hope you\\'ll keep us updated about your thinking and what happens. if there\\'s anything i can do, please let me know. sincerely, k\\n\\nthanks for your comments and suggestions. i\\'m thinking about what you said about the central account idea and wondering about some particulars. would you, then, during class have all the computers logged into the same central account? i suppose the students wouldn\\'t know the password to this account (or else they\\'d be able to use it unsupervised from home). so would you then type in the password when they want to upload their work? or do they just save it on the local computers? i\\'m thinking in particular of several students i have that like to work on their projects from home. sometimes they turn up in class having made quite major enhancements to what they have done. (one fifth grader even had one of his games selected for a \"best scratch games\" gallery someone was putting together.) i\\'m feeling really mixed feelings about the whole thing. some students really love posting their projects and hope to get some comments or recognition (as they sometimes do). it makes it feel very exciting and timely to them compared to just doing something for our small computer class. i will definitely look at those lesson plans thoroughly. i like to see scratch used as a media for learning in other subjects. (good examples of that would make for an interesting scratch gallery or perhaps there already is one.) bruce\\n\\nhi bruce my students do not log in to accounts in class. instead they work on their projects in class and save it on the local computers. when their projects are completed, i save it to a thumbdrive and upload to the central account at home. (our firewall doesn\\'t permit us to upload to the scratch site in school). i see your point about their being able to work on it at home. there is a way to get around that as well. they can work on it at home, save it to a thumbdrive and update it in class. i think all of these issues are easy to work out. as the saying goes \"where there is a will, there is a way!\" nancy\\n\\nnancy: thanks for sharing your experiences! i have a few questions: do you let your students use your central account to participate on the site (e.g. post comments, create galleries, tag, love-its, etc)? also, do you have the feeling that they go and check the comments people have posted on their projects posted on the central account? what do you think students get out of the online community when using a central account?\\n\\nhi andres i do not give the students the password to the account. they do not post comments, create galleries, tag, etc. they do check the comments people have posted on their projects and i let them know when there are comments if they haven\\'t checked. i do think that as my students are only 10-11 years old, it is best that there be some limits on their participation with the online community. as their teacher, i am the responsible party after all. i think a little common sense goes a long way to ensuring that their participation on the site is always safe and a positive experience. nancy\\n\\ni also use a central account and suggest to kids that they make a personal one at home under parent supervision. posting to the school account comes with permission. i didn\\'t think much about the limiting impact this has on communication about each other\\'s projects until seeing the online chat that erupted in a different setting, when we made a wiki to share math concepts. for that, i gave each student their own log-in as a trial. they quickly discovered the message feature, which i was monitoring. some mornings i came in to find 30 messages, mostly random one-line kid chat but often enough about the math that it positively impacted the quality of the pages. (then, a couple kids realized they could use the wiki log-in from school to make their own wikis, unmonitored and public. so, alas, i\\'m not sure if i\\'ll do this the same way another time.) anyway, the point is that in the restricted scratch web environment i allow, i\\'m not seeing anywhere close to the same level of authentic kid commenting as for the wiki project. that seems a shame, and worth addressing.\\n\\nnancy, i liked your aesop fables project quite a bit. i may do that as a closing project with my 2nd-3rd grade and maybe 4th-5th as well (provided i get to continue with scratch). --- regarding the comments, accounts and wiki discussion, i think it is either clever or a lucky accident that scratch seems to only allow communication between users as part of project comments. (maybe there is another way, but i haven\\'t found it.) i think that helps to keep things on topic and also makes it relatively easy to cut down on flack by simply turning off project comments (or so it would seem).\\n\\nhi bruce glad you liked it. please let me know how it went with your younger students. good luck! nancy\\n\\n', '12677': \"creative computing workshop august 8 - 11, 2012 mit

these curricula are grouped by age or grades of kids or, better, math (or physics) topics, e.g.: - algebra projects - geometry projects - calculus projects etc. more exactely, i mean that you may find hundreds of projects tagged math or physics in the scratch site but they span a very different level of complexity and so i have to check each of them one by one ... maybe a finer tuned tagging could help in this view, like: math/geometry math/basic_arithmetic math/algebra and the same for physics thank you in advance ps: if my question is not clear, just ask me more details\\n\\nhello, i am not aware of a resource that does what you ask. you are right on about there needing to be such a thing, so somehow us teachers need to figure out how to make it happen. i wonder if there is interest in a

save that many times for sure. ie 7 in pc (vista)\\n\\nit\\'s definitely strange behavior! i\\'ll keep an eye on it -- thanks for the usage information.\\n\\nyou can add scratch projects (or links to projects and galleries) as resources on scratched. resources can be described by the site taxonomy (age, content type, curricular area) or folksonomy (community-supplied keywords). between the two of these you should be able to describe the grade and strand. as for quality indicators, the idea of resource rating systems was brought up in another thread. for now, comments (and the resource description itself) can be used to describe the quality and usability of the project. for example, i added a resource about stories. it\\'s a collection of projects that i think are great examples of using scratch for storytelling. hope that helps, karen\\n\\ni know in theory that the current labels should allow us to make a hierarchy, but it feels complicated and hard to organize. i agree with behrouz about having topics and subtopics in a list that an educator can easily navigate when browsing. it is the same sort of wish that i have for project galleries. it would be lovely to be able to organize them with nesting folders or links inside links.\\n\\nok, i see how you did the story project grouping. imagine, though, that someone else wants to add to the collection. then later on the collection gets organized by projects that build from one concept to the next. then someone wants to insert a project into the middle of the collection because it fits better there. is that possible in the current set-up? karen r.\\n\\noh, i think i understand what you\\'re trying to do. scratched was designed to be flexible across lots of different types of resources, which makes it hard to have that sort of hierarchical specificity. two ideas come to mind. i guess you could either: (1) be flexible about the way you imagine the collection being presented (e.g. across resources instead of building one resource up) and use scratched, or (2) use another tool to construct your collection (e.g. like a wiki to generate a taxonomy with as much nesting as you like) and then point to it from scratched. what do you think? do you have other ideas? it\\'s a great project -- let me know how i can help!\\n\\nyes, karen, i share your view; moreover, i\\'d like to place our discussion in the mind of a teacher working in whatever school in the world (isn\\'t that scratch is intended to ?) and let\\'s ask ourselves: what does this man/woman need to let scratch land in his/her classroom ? 1. he/she should be sufficiently experienced with the language (a lot has already been written ) 2. after that the question is: well, i have to teach this topic to these kids of this age in this country, is there anything out there to help me ? the teacher may be really busy so he/she goes quickly through web resources, looking for what is in order; if this is the goal a web resource for scratch should satisfy, a good starting point could be the structure of the geogebra wiki page, which i use a lot (i\\'m very sorry, i do not know how to add the hyperlink here): http://www.geogebra.org/en/wiki/index.php/english#mathematics:_high_school topics are neatly organized, a teacher may go and search easily, people around the world may contribute and so on ... as you already know; take a look and share your view thank you again for the work you\\'re doing\\n\\ni would have hoped that the wiki would stay in scratched and be managed by a editor group we already have a few candidates for this group. they will decide who gets to insert what where. search and being able to limit it with the tags that i mentioned would have been so much easier. even if we had a search that would keep limiting the set of projects that would help. so a teacher like karen could search for 6-8 then for geometry then coordinates. isuggest for now just to test the water: 1.wedivide up the projects in the math gallery and give thema quality ranking like quality a, quality b for those that can be used in the classroom (there maybe 100+ of these) . 2. then assign grade strand, topicsand subtopics to these.\\n\\nhere is another thought about how to approach this project. most math curriculum design these days starts from a set of standards, in particular the national council for teachers of mathematics. this is the link to their tables of standards for grades 6-8, for example. http://standards.nctm.org/document/chapter6/alg.htm how about choosing a level like this, putting the table in a wiki, then adding a column to the table that has scratch project demonstrations, project assignments, or projects that use the concept? teachers could check the standard they need to teach and see what sorts of projects address it. problems with this--there are a lot of standards, the language of standards can be dense, projects fit more than one standard ... karen r.\\n\\nhi karen (r.), thank you for the link you highlighted ! i think it fits almost perfectly what i had in mind. more exactely, my proposal may be told as follows: pretend to be a math teacher in grade 7 (or whatever else), preparing one (or more than one) algebra class consider choose one (or more than one) item of the left column for \"expectations\" standards each of these elements (expanded or not into their more detailed right column version) should report links to scratch projects that the committee (let\\'s call it this way, freely change it if you disagree) has identified as fitting enough to that expectation finally, the teacher downloads and that\\'s done ! imho, we can also add a cumulative reviewing system such that who downloads a particulat project may also increase (in his/her view) or decrease the degree of fitness of that project into that expectation; this system should be carefully moderated by the committee, to prevent a mess of confusing scoring. anyway it may be useful to get a realtime feedback by educators using scratch for math and related subjects. your opinions are welcome. thank you for your attention. ps: it would be a plus to add also a scoring system reserved for young users, as they are a very active partner of scratch development.\\n\\nkaren (r.), robertoet al, i think the following link provides a good start for strand ,topic and subtopic and this may be what we start with rather than the more details of the link that you shared from nctm. these are basically th same but now have topic and subtopic also. i have started extracting these and i will share but we need to see how we can divide the work of tagging projects with these. karen (b.) can scratched built something special for this purpose i hope we can discuss this in the workshop you may wish to run it by the team there. http://www.linkslearning.org/teachers/1_math/2_curriculum_planning/3_k-8_math_content/index.html\\n\\nive a different point of view about the way scratch can help the kids in the studying of school matters: it stimulates the pupil to make his own research about the subjects that he can work out with the scratch. then, first they need to learn how the scratch works, in developing very much easy projects with a lot of handmade draws or net imported ones. afterwards, they need to see some, (only a few) projects well classified, (this is what your question is about), and i recommend to visit all the galleries of drsuper, goch and paddle2see, to mention only three scratchers that have collected properly some projects of the whole scratch world.. then, they must takeoff to their own fly, scratching the school matters with the support of their teachers and, in second line, the help of seniors scratchers.\\n\\nhi roberto, im afraid i must to give you back your question: tell me one concrete subject that you would like to see transformed in a scratch project to use in classroom and ill give you the project by measure with all the aspects and changes that you consider as improvements. in conclusion: i thinkthat you can require from a tailor a handmade suite that fits you instead of entering in a supermarket to search among the shelfs a suit that is the nearest of your needs.\\n\\nthanks for your comments, fernando. my proposal is intended to teachers who have strict curriculum demands (e.g. from the ministry of education) and cannot spend as much time as they like to activities other than curriculum teaching. every tool helping in doing this job is welcome. your approach is good and i have been using it in my cs activities in after school centers since years ago, where curriculum demands are less compelling and the teacher/educator can decide what to do/not to do on his/her own. my 2 cents.\\n\\nhello, let me get into this discussion. a teacher of an afternoon course (7th & 8th grade) gave me some tasks she made for their students. she\\'s very interested in using scratch in combination with math and physics. i\\'ll give you the first task: the capital is \"programming with scratch - illustration and calculation of fields\" 1. draw a (thin) line (ab) from point (a, coordinates specification) (horizontal) with a lenght of (5cm) - thin is variable, it can also be thick or dashed - horizontal is variable, it can also be vertical or angle of 45 degrees that\\'s only one task. later on they have to do calculations on cuboids, prisms and other geometrical problems. the goal should be (teachers opinion) to teach the kids in easy programming and math. the problem i figured out is that you can only demonstrate or visualize the problem in scratch. i think it\\'s hard to teach programming in scratch and boring tasks like the one i mentioned above. either the kids learn to program or learn and understand why they use appropriate formulas for geometric calculations. in the scratch forums and gallaries are a lot of interesting visualizations of math problems. but do they explain the formulas working in the background? isn\\'t that what\\'s important for math and physics? what do you think? any suggestions to combine programming in scartch and learning math? thanks in advance thilo p.s.: i think you can teach tasks like that in afternoon courses only, because teachers have strict curriculum demands (like roberto said).\\n\\ni am co-teaching a physics + programming + math unclass this fall. we had three two-hour weekly meetings so far. we have twelve homeschool kids, ages ten to sixteen, with varying levels of physics, math and programming backgrounds. here are our tasks: week 1 physics: the scientific method. how many water drops fit on a penny? hypothesis, observation, data collection. programming: make an applet in scratch (very open-ended exploration, noisy happy group) week 2 physics: variables. pendilum experiments. programming: design a pendilum in scratch (still open-ended, with a topic though) week 3 physics: scientific communication. \"silly robot\"games (describe making pb&j sandwich in words, with the \"robot\" doing everything possible wrong; describe your wooden block construction in words from beyond a screen and have a friend reproduce it) programming: make your pendilum take user input with multiple variables. ~*~*~*~*~* the gallery with a few of the projects is here:http://scratch.mit.edu/galleries/view/58724 ~*~*~*~*~* from week 2 write-up: \"to recap, we saw examples of several major approaches to programming a pendulum, including direct animation (creating an instance of every event and then going through them in a slide show manner), repetitious code (turn, turn again, turn again), pseudo-random motion (one object following another, which is programmed to move in a certain way), infinite cycles (turn forever), and terminating cycles (\"turn given number of times\" or \"turn until a certain angle is reached\"). this is a nice example space to talk about programming methods - we started the discussion a tiny bit, but will continue more next week. programming approaches parallel the ways people think about the world and make sense of it, but are mediated by one\\'s programming and visualization/storytelling skills.\" ~*~*~*~*~* from week 3 write-up: this week, the modeling task was to have models take input from the user in the form of variables. different people used different methods for input, mostly keyboard buttons and mouse clicks, but some experimented with on-screen buttons as well. the homework is to finish what you started, and to upload your applets into our gallery, which you can find at http://scratch.mit.edu/galleries/view/58724 next week, we will start from looking at everybody\\'s applets, making the master list of everybody\\'s variables, and using it to discuss the idea of laws, from the math point of view statements about relationships among variables, in real and virtual worlds. for those of you interested in game design, laws create game mechanics http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/game_mechanics please put a note of some sort on the screen of your model, explaining what input it takes (e.g. keys 1-6). these applets are open source, and many people will probably be using them. during the meeting, each author explained his or her model\\'s input in words. i am very happy with the atmosphere of creativity and cooperation in the group. the models are getting more complex and involved. i can\\'t wait to see everybody\\'s variables. i bet we have a dozen or two different ones among us!\\n\\ni created a gallery for mental math tips and tutorials... you can tag the projects according to us or uk curriculum. you can also suggest new projects to be added to gallery. http://scratch.mit.edu/galleries/view/61224 nevit dilmen\\n\\n',

classroom accounts or multiple student accounts. however, this feature won\\'t be available until later this spring. in the meantime, one strategy is to have students create accounts at home with a

use in school. there are around 200 pupils in the school who would benefit from using scratch and less admin legwork means i am more likely to get the go-ahead from the top on introducing scratch into our curriculum. thanks, rachel\\n\\nmichelle: how is the mitscratch team imlementation of \\'educator accounts\\' coming? marianne\\n\\nhi marianne, we are waiting to hear an update and i will post something as soon as i know. thanks for your patience! m\\n\\nhave \\'educator accounts\\' options been implemented yet? i can\\'t seem to find it on the website.\\n\\ni am following a few of these posts, but would be nice to consolidate them to just one thread so that everyone can just follow/update a single one. second, has anyone documented/implemented a workaround that a teacher can do to set up accounts for multiple students (can either be teacher effort, or student effort)? for example: 1. create a username for each student, for username use [schoolname].[studentfirstname] and 2. for password: [studentlastname] 3.for email, use student.[studentfirstname]_[studentlastname]@[schooldomain] 4. ?\\n\\nhi alexander, i really like this idea of collectively brainstorming a streamlined process for creating multiple accounts! two suggestions: regarding #3, one strategy i\\'ve heard from educators is to have students use the teacher\\'s email or to create a shared class email (e.g., schoolnamescratchers@gmail.com). that way, if a student posts any inappropriate content to the scratch website, you will be notified. maybe a #4 step would be to create a class list by having students post their username and a password hint in a shared google doc, spreadsheet, or using google forms, for students who want to find and friend each other or if a student forgets their username/password. another strategy for keeping usernames/passwords private is to have students write their username and password in individual sealed envelopes that you keep safe unless needed. thanks, michelle\\n\\nhi alexander, according to eric schilling, students will need a valid email address for confirmation of new accounts. http://scratched.gse.harvard.edu/discussions/news-and-announcements/scratch-update-email-confimation michelle\\'s suggestion to use a teacher email or a class gmail is necessary if students don\\'t have their own emails. marianne\\n\\nthanks for the replies all! my idea of creating \"generic\" email addresses for students was assuming there was a catchall for @schooldomain that can forward to a central e-mail to approve/confirm the accounts. for a \"shared\" email to use for all students, wouldn\\'t that confuse students and remove the individual projects/tasks or progress for each student? and it may allow students to alter other student projects, etc. ? to be honest, i haven\\'t yet explored the site in full as i\\'m hopefully waiting for the \"student accounts\" to get set up before exploring. i\\'m also wondering what would happen if i do move ahead with a workaround (create generic emails for each student) and then educator/student accounts is eventually enabled. would there be a good transition to move to those accounts? maybe there is an \"ideal workaround\" that is more seamless to transition to the educator/student accounts once enabled?\\n\\ni already use google-ids to share information. i also have experience with sharing using google-groups (if you share to the email-addres to the group, all members of the group can acces the google-docs folders). in an ideal situation id/authentication/authorization management would not be organized by teachers, but teachers could just use the school-assigned ids. for example: if a school happens to use google-apps then the 13+ limit is irrelevant and you could share files to groups, and students could share back. i do not think teachers should be asigning all these ids because they need to keep their own administration of ids outside of the school\\'s central administration. students should be connecting at a higher level and teachers should be using existing ids. please note that i do not blame anyone for finding workable solutions, but i think it is just easier for teachers and better in the interest of the students to use ids that are established elsewhere and just used by the teacher.

scratch and i am obiviously missing an important piece. i had my student look at the examples of names then create something of their own. we can not get their project to start back at the beginning when they open the document. i\\'ll use the tamika example to try to explain what i mean. when you open the file, it always starts with the letters in a line, with a solid black background. once you click on the green flag, each letter moves leaving a color trail. when you stop or restart it always continues with the colors over the black; however if you close the file and reopen it, you start over -- letters in a line with the black stage. every time my students close and then reopen their file, they get exactly what they had when they stopped. what needs to be done so that it always starts at the beginning the file is first opened. thanks for your help!\\n\\nif i am understanding you correctly... the tamika script has two scripts for each letter sprite both of which are activated when the green flag is clicked. one sets the intial position (go to x: y: ) in a line at the top. the other is a forever loop that moves the sprite and bounces when on the edge. you may need the intial position setting script.\\n\\nthanks, i will double check to make sure they have the initial position. how do you get a \"clean\" stage again?\\n\\nuse the clean-block from the pen-section. put it directly under the [when \"greenflag\" clicked]. if i got you right...\\n\\nhi vicki does anders mean the \\'clear\\' block from the pen palette?\\n\\nanne, you are so right. :)\\n\\nit is an important part of any program to set initial assumptions to a known state at the beginning. whether this involves clearing the playing field from pen drawn lines with the clear function, repositioning sprites to known locations, resetting sizes, visibility, colors, costumes, lists, variables, etc.everything must be reset if you wish to get back to a known state. part of programming is the mental discipline to ask, \"how should this whole thing start?,\" and answering that with code. in your case, it may involve reinitializing before saving. good luck! and let me know if i can help with figuring out how to get back to your initialized state. al\\n\\n', '14614': 'scratch en informtica de 4_ de eso\\n\\nalvaro , ahora he visto tu mensaje. venga a ver si damos un empujon al material en

app-inventor.http://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/front.html 2. school-email-addresses are not limted to 13+ 3. in schoold that do no use google other email-addresses can be used to create google-account but that may raise the 13+issue. 4. after that google-groups or google+ circles can be used to manage groups and share folders.. 5. reliable, widely used system. mian advantage: for schools it can take away the burden of id-management from the teacher and put it mainly with the school. after that teachers can just select groups and individuals. creating a bespoke id+grouping

do this. kind of like a \"drop box\" for our projects from everyone in the class so they can all see them and i can see them all. any suggestions are greatly appreciated!\\n\\ni\\'m going to add my two cents to this issue because there have been several posts about class management of scratch projects since 2.0 came out. first i want to say how awesome scratch 2.0 is, and give a big pat on the back to the scratch team for delivering such a great web app. i still consider scratch to be my top application for teaching elementary and middle school computer science, as well as just the coolest program to create stuff with in general. that said, and as others have commented on here, it has been a frustrating experience using scratch 2.0 in a classroom environment. creating a class studio for projects is simply not working. as a result, we cannot see all of our projects in one place, and comment and critique them. working in the cloud only (with chromebooks), i am forced to have kids copy and paste links to their projects into an edmodo group, where we can see each other\\'s work and make comments. very cumbersome. and with grades where i cannot use edmodo, i am lost. i know the scratch team is working on a class management tool, and i have to emphasize that tool cannot come soon enough. please know this is not a trivial matter for educators using scratch 2.0. we desperately want to use scratch, but this studio issue is really messing things up :( respectfully, peter r.\\n\\ncan i ask here if it would be possible to link the sharing to a google-id. advantages: 1. widely known, trusted, used. in education paticularly. 2. allows google-groups to be used for authroization. this allows both professional (with google-apps domain) and private (free version of google-groups) usage. if the authorization is chosen the way zoho com does (allows signing in with a google-apps-domain id without the domain admin having to authorize it, that would be great) 3. mit already hosts appinventor which uses google-logins. so it should be known within the organization. 4. it will still allow the core (scratch) to be hosted at mit or anywhere. 5. google has a good security reputation. 6. it could be advantageous to not have to share with the whole world. a student could be allowed to share work with just a teacher. this would involve changing the code, though. possible disadvantages: 1. avoid getting tied in to g+ for privacy reasons and it will exclude many domains/schools that do allow gapps but not g+. 2. general privacy concerns. 3. will require signup for google-id. 4. exclusion of countries that block google. just my 2c. y. added thoughts: currently the way to see the work of a group of students is really only possible of the students make links to their publicly shared projects available. ways of doing this? 1. email to teacher. (gets confusing) 2. collect all links in one google-site or in a forumpost in a google-group or vle. 3. put them all in a doc (table) or spreadsheet in a doc that is shared with the group. currently it is not possible to collaborate on programming, but that may be aiming to high. since students can share ids they can learn from each other, but could also copy parts from each other. in individual marking situations this is not an advantage.\\n\\ni agree with your observations. i have been able to create studios and have my students share their programs, but this only works when they are all done with their programs. and once they share their programs, everyone can see it, which starts to be a bit too distracting for the students. i have been doing pair programming, which i really like, but since students can\\'t share an account it causes a problem when one of the students is absent. i agree a class management tool is ideal. i would love to continue any and all scratch 2.0 conversations directly. you can find me on twitter @reesegans\\n\\ni have been teasting using edmodo. kids can post the urls in the site (after they shared) and we can all see what they have done.\\n\\ni agree with peter r. the children i teach really want to share their creations with the rest of the class but finding a suitable and secure way is tricky. i need something that is quick and easy and won\\'t get bogged down with being blocked by educational isps. on a lighter note, my children have only recently started using scratch (2 1/2 weeks in) and can\\'t get enough of it. it is seriously blowing my mind! robert n @nobleict\\n\\n', '4196': 'how do you find out how much of a scratch project has come from someone else?

under windows 7 if anyone cares to know :) but when i made some attempts with internet explorer, i also met the same problems. - clicking a sprite with the right button has no effect at all, no popping menu shows. - unfortunately when this happens, the \"copy\" or \"delete\" buttons on top of screen do not react at all either. - when resizing a sprite, its moves seems a bit erratic as if the original size was still being used... as a consequence when going up and then right, for instance, the sprite seems to jump suddenly . - sometimes the sprite goes off screen, while it (hopefully) still appears at the bottom of the screen. yet i cannot bring it back on screen, all i can do is delete it with a right click. - sometimes when i insert a second sprite, it won\\'t move at all nor even appear on screen. - i still miss a button that would bring the sprite back to its initial position (also cancel moves, rotations and special effects all at once) that\\'s quite enough for a start, i really hope someone can help me out since i\\'m wasting a lot of time trying to get things to work properly. thank you for your help !\\n\\nhis_bastien, i\\'m sorry to hear that you\\'re having problems using scratch. here are a few tips for these two issues you mentioned: - sometimes the sprite goes off screen, while it (hopefully) still appears at the bottom of the screen. yet i cannot bring it back on screen, all i can do is delete it with a right click. - i still miss a button that would bring the sprite back to its initial position (also cancel moves, rotations and special effects all at once) you can click on the \"go to x:0 y:0\" and \"point in direction 90\" blocks in the motion category, which will move your sprite to the center of the screen and point it towards the right. under the looks category, the \"clear graphic effects\" block will clear all special effects such as color. these are also useful blocks to use to reset your sprites at the beginning of your project. you can do this by placing these blocks directly under the \"when green flagged clicked\" block to initialize your sprites\\' positions and looks each time you start your project. regarding the other problems you are encountering, i would suggest that you write to the mit scratch team to let them know you are having issues. i\\'m not sure if it\\'s a browser issue, but if there is a bug with the scratch interface, but they might want to know or have more information on how to resolve it. you can contact them at help@scratch.mit.edu. i hope that helps! sincerely, michelle, on behalf of the scratched team\\n\\nhi michelle, thank you for your reply, any help is welcome :) well maybe next time i should start with placing that \"reset\" button on screen so that the kids

moderating the chat. totally new to twitter chats? learn more below... what is a twitter chat? twitter chats are conversations that take place through tweets that are connected through a shared hashtag. our hashtag will be#scratchedchatand our first chat is wednesday, october 28 at 7pm (boston time). how can i join? you will need a twitter account to participate in the chat. to sign up, visit twitter.com. there are several ways to view a chat as it is happening: go to twitter.com and type in the hashtag you want to follow (e.g. #scratchedchat) in the search bar. you will see a list of every tweet that uses the hashtag, with the most recent tweets at the top. third-party tools (outside of twitter) are also available. tweetdeck (tweetdeck.com) and tweetchat (tweetchat.com) are two options. what should i expect from the twitter chat? the twitter chat will start at 7pm (boston time). the @scratchedteammoderator will start the chat by welcoming participants, inviting people to introduce themselves. the chat will proceed with a series of questions from @scratchedteam. chat participants are encouraged to share their thoughts on questions and to pose their own questions to the group. to add to the conversation, be sure to include the chat hashtag #scratchedchat to your tweet. the chat will be 60 minutes, ending at 8pm (boston time). what else would be helpful to know about twitter? here are a few twitter tips, (adapted from twittersinsider tips) #- a hashtag is any word or phrase with the # symbol immediately in front of it.the symbol turns the word into a link that makes it easier to find and follow a conversation about that topic. .@- tweets that have a period (.) before the @reply are meant to be seen by all of a users followers--not just those who follow both the sender and the receiver. rt - like an e-mail forward, retweets pass along another users tweet to all of your followers. this can be indicated with a rt when you manually retweet (copy and paste the content from a tweet into your own tweet) instead of using the retweet button. this is a way people spread news on twitter and add their own commentary to the shared tweet. mt - similar to rt, an abbreviated for modified tweet. you can place a mt before the retweeted text to pass along your own message in addition to a modified or shortened version of the original. ht - a hat tip or heard through symbol (ht) is used to indicated that youve found out about something from another twitter user--and you want to credit them on twitter.\\n\\n\", '25224': 'con este hilo de dicusin me gustaria

self-organize into different interest groups and hands-on activities introduce you to scratched, the website where educators share their scratch ideas, experiences, and resources the meetup is open to all boston-area educators with some previous scratch experience. this meetup is for you if you can answer yes to one of the following: i know how to snap scratch blocks together i have created a project in scratch i use scratch in my teaching practice i have attended a previous scratch meetup or workshop scratch educator meetups are held every first saturday of the month during the school year. we particularly encourage educators from the same school, program, etc. to attend together as a group. the workshop is free and includes lunch. ready to register? sign up at

through the event, let\\'s do a mid-point review to help us think about what we\\'ve done -- and what we might want to add or change. think about your initial goal(s).please respond to the following 2 sets of questions: in what way(s) have you made progress on these goals?what aspects of the workshop have been helpful? what else do you need to achieve the goals you initially set? have new goals emerged? that is, are there other things that you haven\\'t done or learned or explored yet that you really want to do before the end of the workshop? sincerely, karen, on behalf of the creative computing organizing team\\n\\ni\\'m still looking for something in the way of curriculium/lesson plans/projects that i can use to get started in the fall. additionalgoal is to build up contacts of others to share stuff with.\\n\\nthe creative computing workshop has been everything that was expected and more to this point. i\\'ve learned how to employ several features in scratch that iwas not even aware of to this point. moreover, i\\'ve generated ideas of how imight use these to assist students. the hands-on approach to the workshop has been extremely influential in generating ideas to use in the classroom as well as in professional development workshops. they have also provided great approaching to teaching and learning scratch. new goals have emerged because of the workshop. with the new jersey core curriculum content standards set to change in september 2012. i see a clear opportunity to utilize scratch in achieving new objectives outlined by the state. these goals cannot be fulfilled before the end of the workshop but are certainly worthwhile.\\n\\ni feel that i have completely achieved my goal thus far. i wanted to become more familiar with scratch soi could provide professional development for my school district. iam sure there is so much more to learn, but i feel that ihave a good foundation to build upon. the only thing i might be lacking is more ideas on how to incorporate scratch into other disciplines other than math & computer science. i would really love to learn how to make backgrounds scroll so icould help students create more interactive projects.\\n\\nthe most useful thing i have learned so far is the \"broadcast\" block. this opens up a whole new set of ideas for me that i can use in my class. this was my primary goal in taking this course. new goals have not really emerged for me. i would be nice if we can do something with a pico board.\\n\\na big goal was to get better at scratch and i do feel stronger. there is functionality i haven\\'t worked with yet...specifically in the operating and variable blocks. i need to use them before end of course. i hope to feel clearer about how to incorporate scratch into a non-technology course (math). i\\'m thinking it might be fun to do some problem posing through a scratch project...might catch their attention. also, i hope to use scratch (if i can get computer lab or cart) the first week of school to develop the habits i want to refer to all year. would love a conversation about ways to collaborate with tech staff so some of the early learning takes place outside the content class...\\n\\ni have been able to meet people with the same focus as myself who do things differently. i have learned of other approaches to teaching programming that i can try.\\n\\ni have already met my goal, to learn more about scracth and learn some new strategies for getting young people excited about computing. all the activities we\\'ve done so far are ones i can use with my students and campers. now i am looking forward to learning more about integrating art with scratch and playing with the effects. i would also be really interested in playing with the pico boards and lego, integrating scratch with external devices.\\n\\nmy original goal was to gain confidence in using scratch, thus allowing me to work with students and teachers back home. i have made progress in terms of learning more and feeling comfortable in the program. however, i am still looking forward to more scratch time :) the introduction to each activity has been very helpful for me. i have learned to watch the demos carefully, try new things, and ask questions. one project i loved was the partner/switch work. we started a story, moved over to another, and finished with a third. very cool idea, lots of benefits. my new goal is to create more than animation. i want to learn how to make my work interactive. perhaps a game. maybe today. and gee, maybe i\\'ll think about getting/using a picoboard like larry :)\\n\\ni feel like i have accomplished my goal. i am not very comfortable with programming but this gave me an opportunity to dive in and become more familiar with the language and tools.\\n\\ni think my initial goals have been met. i think i can integrate scratch into my curriculum in a way that will interest students. my new goal will be to see how i can get scratch to work with lego robotics kits.\\n\\none goal was to interact with many different people and share our teaching ideas and experiences. i have truly enjoyed doing that. the shared story activity really helped with that. it\\'s awsome that we have our discussion link so we can continue exchanging ideas with each other. my other goal, (more lofty) is to develop some concrete plans for professional development. i have two ideas i want to work on: 1) to have a workshop (or playshop) in which teachers are encouraged to bring their own children regardless of age and my programming students help me facilitate the experience. my students are already eager to do this with me. i need to get a structure to it. 2) based on what was suggested last night, i wnat to create a project that truly meets our school wide technology standard.\\n\\ni\\'ve definitely got some materials i can use in my classroom now. the scratched website is a great resource.thanks for the cards. i\\'ve learned a lot about using scratch through you and my peers. i hope to continue learning more about using scratch as we continue. thanks for the opportunity!\\n\\ni like the term \"playshop.\"\\n\\ni have progressed towards my goals so far - i\\'ve learned quite a few new elements of scratch that open up new possibilities for me. my goal for the remainder of the session is to collaborate with my colleagues in designing a unit for our 3rd grade.\\n\\ni have definitely become more knowledgeable about scratch, i have learned so much about different programming aspects.i like the broadcast function. ihaven\\'t tried the operatorsyet and i would like to think of more uses for the pen. i have found the collaboration to be very helpful and inspiring. i am still looking to get more ideas for projects for elementary age kids and how to put together some simple lesson plans.\\n\\none of my goals was to have an opportunity to interact with other professionals to learn different activities to use with scratch. i have learned a great deal up to this point and i plan to continue connecting today and tomorrow. even though i have been using scratch in my classroom already, i have learned many new techniques that i wasn\\'t aware of! thank you!\\n\\ni came here to be inspired while icreate an entire new k-5 technology curriculum for my district. i am definitely inspired. i am really excited for the breakout sessions as a group of us have been discussing talking about using the wedo, mindstorms etc... opening up an entire new world for me.\\n\\ni\\'ve definitely deepened my knowledge of the \"workings\" of scratch through the collaboration and sharing activities. beyond that, and perhaps more importantly, i\\'ve gotten some terrific ideas for how to embed scratch into curriculum in meaningful ways and i\\'ve seen some great examples of lessons/activities/ i can do to introduce computational thinking to my students. i feel like i\\'m definitely on my way to achieving the goals iset the first day. i\\'m not sure if i can consider this a \"new goal\" or not, but i\\'ve changed my perspective on how i think scratch should be used. i think i was struggling with the idea of creating projects that were open-ended enough to allow students to work at their strengths and interests, yet have enough rigor to use as assessment. now, i am looking at things differently and realize that i don\\'t have to take on so much of the responsibility and i can focus on the process for assessment and allow students to choose content. i\\'m still working through this new thought...and look forward to clarifying it even more over the next few days. sandi\\n\\nit has been a great workshop! my first goal was meet. amazing people doing fantastic work, is what i have seen so far. one thing i\\'m taking back into my classroom is the \"role playing\" activity to demonstrate the use of the broadcast tool. i can see my students getting into it!\\n\\nmygoal was to learn more aboutscratch so i would be able to re-work some projects that we have curriculum projects in microworlds, so our older students have an opportunity to become more experienced in scratch. the chance to connect with other teachers and learn about their uses and wishes for scratch in their classroom is invaluable. i believe both of these goals are being met.\\n\\ni am still working on a personal project that shows students the hurdles that they might encounter in life. the project will show the 3 different ways children and adults approach and handle these hurdles. i hope to have at least 4 different scenes. there are still a lot of things that i have not used, but that is because i never really used scratch till this year. i am looking forward to doing more. i feel that i am always trying to catch-up i am teaching this summer and i am anxious to try this out in our summer school/camp for the final weeks of the year. i like the part where i will be able to upload there work as a group.\\n\\nyes john, i agree. the broadcast & receive commands are awesome and helpful!\\n\\ni\\'m getting a better feel for scratch every day and enjoy learning new techniques every day.collaborative atmosphere ishelpful and fun.thanks! i wonderhow scratch handlessuch cs ideas as findingthe max value in a list or sorting a listof values\\n\\nit\\'s great to have had longer stretches for using scratch than in the past. i have a better feel for what it takes to program and this will serve me well in understanding what kids at my school have already been introduced to. also, i\\'m a little more confident in thinking i can better think about integrating into a collaborative project between art, tech and language that already exists. i\\'m even thinking about using it in music class for kids to illustrate form. i would like to learn more about the music portion of scratch. from what i\\'ve seen so far it doesn\\'t seem intuitive, but i\\'d love to be proven wrong!\\n\\nthe workshop has been extremely informative and fun! i found the style of introducing each session with human volunteers to mirror the goals needed to achieve in programming extremely helpful in solidifying the flow of ideas. i came to this workshop with the hope of getting indepth knowledge of scratch to use with my middle school students and i find that along with that i am also learning useful techniques on how to guide students through the process of computational thinking. what i need to do next is put some lesson plans in place for the next academic year.\\n\\nmy goal was to be inspired. i\\'ve definitely been exposed to some great ideas that will keep me thinking for a while. i\\'ve enjoyed the variety of activities: in addition to the specifically scratch-focused training, i loved the tour and the panel discussion. i would love to hear mitch, karen, michelle and amanda describe their visions of \"what schools could/should look like,\" and also learn about innovative or \"model\" schools they they are aware of. i\\'d like us to think ahead about ways for all of the participants and facilitators to continue to collaborate in the future. one suggestion would be to make it easier to identify workshop participants on the scratched site. i also want to make time to learn and explore possibilities with the picoboard. i\\'ll probably do this during the independent project time and/or the game time. i agree that \"broadcast/receive\"are very useful commands. i\\'d be interested to learn about other commands that i may not yet be familiar with. i\\'m enjoying the opportunity to be here. larry\\n\\nthe modeled learning activities have been helpful in learning both the basics programming steps of scratch as well as powerful command like \\'broadcast\\'. my goal of learning more of the advanced commands (operations and variables) would be helpful. it has been very helpful meeting k-12 teachers from various parts of the country listening to their ideas about using scratch and education. one new goal is to find out how to \\'best\\' organize a gallery where k-5 students can post work so that it can be viewed or found in quick manner (within a district with multiple schools or within a school with many class sections on a grade level) your modeling has provided new teaching strategies for me. thank you.\\n\\nscratch is a tool that i have wanted to spend some time considering and this workshop has perfectly provided time for this endeavor. i thoroughly enjoy the format of the conference. the role play activities are all fun, applicable beyond the scratch classroom, and are highly likely to appear in various places in my courses, club activities and community outreach. one very clear idea has emerged for me. i would love to offer an afternoon program using scratch at my daughter\\'s elementary school. another clear application of scratch would be for my school\\'s annual bookday. on bookday the mission is for faculty, students and invited guests to create an array of workshops centered around the themes of a book chosen by a student and faculty committee. my computer science club is known for devising creative and fun workshops. in the past the club has used alice and greenfoot for example. my curricular goal of deciding whether scratch is a good fit for our introductory and middle division programs is also being met. i am convinced scratch would be a very effective tool and will encourage the members of my department to adopt scratch.\\n\\ntwo of my initial goals were to become more comfortable with scratch in general and to develop project ideas & resources. all of these goals have been met. i\\'m feeling really excited about bringing these ideas back to my students. one of my additional goals is to develop an assessment process for an open-ended scratch project. i am thinking about how i can bring students into the process of deciding what makes a superior quality scratch project by watching projects on the website and then discussing the projects that really stood out and why. i do want to have my own ideas as well about what my expectations need to be in terms of learning outcomes as well.\\n\\ni had a goal of learning enough about scratch and from other teachers to be able to teach it. i have definitely made a lot of progress on this goal. i\\'m now hoping to get a pico board to explore the extensions to scratch.\\n\\nin what way(s) have you made progress on these goals?what aspects of the workshop have been helpful? what else do you need to achieve the goals you initially set? by participating in the hands-on activities, i have been able to think of how i will bring them back to my classroom. last night\\'s panel discussion introduced me to a new software, tale blazers, which i hope iwill be able to use. have new goals emerged? that is, are there other things that you haven\\'t done or learned or explored yet that you really want to do before the end of the workshop? i just want to learn more, more, more..... to bring back. i am trying to develop my course.\\n\\nso far i have been pleasantly invigorated by all the sharing that the group members are doing. my goal was to become more proficient in using scratch. yesterday i sat next to janet and she is far more advanced and was very helpful (also patient). i have gotten lots of good ideas and strategies for dealing with the introduction of technology into my classes. as an art teacher i mostly deal with hands on manipulation. i can see scratch blending in nicely with combining several of the projects i already use. for example, making a sprite in illustrator and then using it in scratch (illustrator sets the sprite on a transparent background so it works well with scratch). i found a fantastic example of a scratch project developed by another person in the scratched site called \"got art\". this person has generated a program that draws! it is fantastic!\\n\\nihave met my goal in that i know that iwant to use scratch in my curriculum for both 8th graders and the intro to cs course. ihave thoroughly enjoyed learning so much about scratch in such a short period of time. a second and not expected outcome of the workshop so far is getting ideas for activities to do with my class to introduce lessons. i really enjoyed the story telling activity and even the way that algorithmic thinking has been play acted in this workshop. i use role playing in my classroom for concepts such as recursion and sorting and searching. the workshop has given me additional ideas that i can use for teaching cs in any of my courses. iwould like to learn how to make games in scratch. i can probably muddle thru it now but iam looking forward to learning how others use scratch to make games. my students are very drawn to any language in which they can write games.\\n\\ni feel i have meet my goals to learn more about how to introduce scratch. there is no easy way and monitoring students and their needs is a way to learn more. a new goal, i realize i need to focus more on of the more difficult progam techniques to add challenging tasks for the go faster students.\\n\\ni had imagined this workshop to be strictly focused on scratch programming and so i came here just hoping to see how i can create activities or games with the students in my school. however, being introduced to the panelists last night and the tour of the mit lab has made me think of other kinds of possibilities. i hope to create a write up of all the resources and ideas that have come out of what i learned these days to folks in my professional learning network (pln). i think there\\'s a lot of folks that i know that are doing interesting things in their schools and don\\'t know of the wonderful resources coming from mit. so my new goal is not only to work in my school with scratch and what i\\'ve learned here, but to spread the wealth of information with my pln. one thing i would like to do is to continue the digital conversation of sharing tips, tricks, and scratch programming files.\\n\\nmy goal was to be able to implement computational thinking and programming into the middle school computer curriculum. i have made progress by being provided with insight on how to use scratch in a more advanced way, as well as ideas for projects and activities. the skits, which ive very surprised to admit, were helpful. the skits provided me with ideas on how to illustrate parallelism. no new goals have emerged.\\n\\nmy goal was to see how scratch might fit into my third grade engineering initiative. the implications of using scratch to help teach the engineering design process are obvious. my new goal is to sort out a framework for teaching a trimester-long unit on engineering with scratch. how do i balance giving enough support to those that need it without stifling those who will thrive from open-ended projects? i\\'m thinking about starting with the basics of scratch, perhaps using those flash cards and a simple starter activity. i\\'ll likely incorporate some of the fun lessons demonstrated over the past couple of days (having kids act out commands as sprites!). that could be followed up with some loosely-defined goals, as we did here. i.e. make a dance party. then we can move to a culminating project that is much more open-ended. maybe kids can make proposals for their projects before beginning. that way i can offer guidance for those who do not have a clear goal yet, while staying out of kids\\' way if they don\\'t need me. any suggestions would be fantastic... i\\'d love to hear your ideas.\\n\\nhi larry, i too am very interested in exploring the picoboard and how i can use that in conjunction with science. i would like to be able to recommend using the picoboard for the 4th-7th grader science projects. is this something you would be interested in too?\\n\\nso i arrived late and haven\\'t had the time to write down what my goals were for scratch. i want to be able to use scratch commands seamlessly so that i do not have to constantly debug. what else that has been useful is seeing how others have debugged code that make it easier for me when i come across the same problem. i learned about the \"hide\" and \"show\" functions which have made it 25% easier! my new goals are to see how creative i can really get with scratch!\\n\\nmy initial goal was to develop some very specific activities to support my classroom content standards, mostly ela. i\\'ve been able to come up with ideas for demonstration/teaching, expression/student creation, and assessment. i still want to explore how scratch can be used with lego mindstorms and also use a pico board. also, i have no idea how to use variables or lists.\\n\\nmy initial goal was to become more comfortable using scratch and have a better understanding of it\\'s capabilities. wow. woke up this am with my head exploding with project ideas. moving forward, i want to be more comfortable using variables. i also wondered if you can imbed a projct within a project.\\n\\nmy goals were to feel comfortable enough to share scratch with my colleagues and students and to look at scratch with robotics. through the exercises with and without scratch i do feel comfortable to introduce scratch to help people move forward in their creativity. i realize my goal is to help teachers see how they can integrate technologies, as an educator, that i am comfortable with, and you have provided us with so many tools. i have had some exciting conversations this morning with the people at the peach table about robotics. i believe we are getting together this afternoon to share what we know, what we don\\'t know, and what we want to know.\\n\\ni feel that i am on my way towards accomplishing my goals. i am happy to have the opportunity to learn with other teachers, to hear what they are doing in their classrooms, their experiences with scratch and their plans for the future. i no longer feel that i am alone. i feel that ihave a commuinity of professionals that i can bounce ideas of off,and go to if (and when) i encounter problems. i have also really enjoyed the learning activities that mitch and karen have shared with us. i can\\'t wait to try these out with my students. they really seem to encourage conversation and thinking, which would be great for my students. it is amazing how you can learn \"computational thnking skills\" that don\\'t always require using the computer. i also can\\'t wait to work on my own project. i look foward to the next two days to see what other wonderful new skills ican learn.\\n\\ni\\'d also like to hear about plans for future versions of scratch--what will be included?\\n\\nthanks for the class. it has been great. i reached my goal and had the opportunity to talk to other teachers about creating a scratch advocacy group for elementary students that runs across the curriculum. we have the beginnings of a working plan that we will post. i am looking forward to implementing it. one thought is it would be helpful if the scratch team could provide us with some names of administrators or policy types we could contact. my feelings are the more people we can contact the greater the chance of success. thanks, vicki\\n\\nsally, ifeel the same way. this workshop has generated many new ideas to take back to school. i\\'m enthusiastic about implementing scratch more in the future.\\n\\ni couldn\\'t agree more stacy. ifeel that when i walked in her iknew about 1% of scratch and had 0% of methods to integrate into my class. now, i truly feel that i can use scratch efficiently & effectively in my classroom and help other teachers do the same.\\n\\nmaria, i used the list in scratch to hold a list of words and created a bubble sort. i can show it to you. paul\\n\\ni agree with larry about wanting to connect with other participants on scratched. it\\'s been a great few days and it\\'d be nice to hear how everyone\\'s use of scratch develops with their students over the next school year and beyond.\\n\\nthanks. i think it fits.\\n\\nthank you for a wonderful, creative, and information training session. it was more than i had hoped it to be! i really enjoy having the mini-sessions yesterday so we could pick what was most meaningful for me. i also am still collecting lesson plan and project ideas.\\n\\n', '12462': 'hello eveyrone! i\\'m hoping to find some toronto-area scratchers to help out with an event we\\'re sponsoring at the mozilla foundation offices in toronto, called \"toronto

structured week by week \"lesson plan\" that coordinates with the school curriculum. scratch is the chosen tool. however, my son sees his career in coding and programming - his school unfortunatelyare not offering coding (but are covering general it). i have done coding myself over the past 25 years and have decided to assist him and his friends in getting started in programming. to this end i want to use scratch to teach many concepts and principles for it and coding. what i am struggling with is the following. i have created a new class - i want to add an existing scratch user to the class. when i go to students and the add user - i enter the correct (doubled checked) user name for the scratch user. i get prompted that the user name already exists (which it does) but it will not let me add the user to the class. i have followed the user in question (my son) but how can i add existing users that i know to a class so that they can follow the plans for the class and submit their projects? help please. i don\\'t want to have to create brand new scratch accounts for students each time i create a new class, but will likely be adding teh same group of users time after time and class after class. also it would be very useful if we as teachers could upload a txt file that provided instruction (or requirements) that each student must comply with in order to successfully complete a class/studio/project - is this possible. mark.\\n\\nhi, i have the same problem with student accounts already created that need to be added to my class. i thought i did that last semester but can\\'t figure out how. can someone help? thank you.\\n\\nhi laura and mark, i understand your desire to be able to add existing scratchers to classes. to quote the scratch team\\'s faq: \"only

pictures in front of a green screen and then remvoe the green. thank you, barb ericson\\n\\nhi barb, i think this would be a task better suited for a 3rd party photo editing software like photoshop or perhaps the gimp. they include tools that make selecting and removing backgrounds easy, especially solid colors. the paint editor in scratch has an eraser tool that you could use to remove the background, but it\\'ll be tough following the silhouette of the portrait to cleanly remove the background. mike\\n\\nhi barb, this is really easy to do with scratch. in the image editor, you can select the fill tool, then the \"transparent\" color (the grey/white checkerboard pattern) in the color palette. hope that helps! k\\n\\nit looks like we will have to use a combination of the transparency fill and the eraser in scratch. the greenscreen pictures don\\'t give a perfect background and shadows near people are hard to erase.\\n\\nhow do you do it in gimp? i downloaded it but can\\'t figure out a good way to do it.\\n\\ngimphas something called the fuzzy select tool (looks like a wand in the tool palette). when you touch the fuzzy select tool to a spot of color it selects all the entire area of color. you can then delete it, which will leave a white background in place of the deleted color. if you want a transparent background, add an alpha layer (from layers >transparency) before you use the fuzzy select tool. then when you delete the block of color you\\'ll have a checkerboard pattern, like karen described with the transparency fill. since you have shadows on your green background, using this tool will take out large chunks of the background at one time, but it won\\'t get you as clean of an outline as you might want. gimp also has a tool called the free select tool(looks like a lasso). this lets you outline parts of your image so you can delete it. i don\\'t have the patience to edit images like this, but you might :). the best advice iwould give you is to find a graphic designer to do this for you. a more practical ti would be to zoom in on your image and work with small areas at one time. there\\'s probably other ways to acomplish this. best to experiment. mike\\n\\n', '23536': 'hi, i am teaching a short (8week) computer programming class using scratch. this is the first time i have taught this so i am learning as i go. i am looking for a quick and easy way for my students to share their projects with each other and with me so i can look them over and give them a grade and suggestions. i was hoping there was a way that i could create a studio and have kids share their projects with the studio so that everyone would have access to them. i cannot seem to find a way to do this on the scratch website. any teachers out there who might have some suggestions? anything is greatly appreciated.\\n\\npatrick: i was thinking the same thing today! i am running a pilot program with a group of 8th graders here in central ny and since we can only meet once in a 6 days cycle, i am using edmodo to commnicate with them and files and assignmnets but i too would like a studio space we could all have in scratch and add things to for eacy access. i know we can seach for files but maybe there is a easier way...\\n\\nkathy, i was able to create a studio on the scratch website for my class. the hard part was there seems to be no way to \"invite\" students to the studio. so each student had to search for and find the studio then \"follow\" it (using the search function then selecting \"studios\"). once there they could add their project to it. the bummer is there is no way for me or them to organize it. i wish there was a way to create folders or something like that. so all their different projects are just \"loose\" within the studio. so when i want to watch them for grading purposes i have to search them and find them. so it is not perfect but at least the students can see each other\\'s projects and make comments etc. hope this helps!\\n\\npatrick: thanks. i was thinking about doing the same thing and you are confirming some of the things i suspected would happen! yesterday i tested out using edmodo to post an url of a scratch project files. it worked well. now, at least i know a student could post to the group: \"here is my lateset scratch project\" with url for others to find it easily and comment on it but lke you said i do not thinki there is any easy way to have a student portfolio of projects in scratch for our students to easily find. most of us eductaors know that the best online resource is one that allows more classroom control. web 2.0 sites like eduglogster and edmodo get it and i know scrtach will too eventually! the trick is to keep design a place in the site for teachers and students to collaborate as a private group, but also allow enough open-ness (public) to share with others in the public scratch community. i too am learning as a i go. as always, i love to learn with the kids-- i just try to stay one step ahead of them! they always teach me how to teach them! :) i am using mit course currciulum (just trying to update pages to relfect scratch2.0) but i alsoprovided

that account. but when i tried to find the studio logged in as myself, i couldn\\'t find it. any advice? it would be wonderful to be able to have a place where students could upload their individual

objective: to encourage children to read, write and publish interactive scratch books in a collaborative way. methodology: 1. to establish a platform by which the children can hangout with one another. this may be something like a google+ hangout or some other reliable, safe and free type of platform. 2. to establish a group of teacher-mentors in their own specialties who will be willing to guide the children in the different aspects of making a book from scratch. : ) (no pun intended) note: in view of the long hours that teachers work, there will probably be three or four teacher per group of students so that at any one time, a teacher-mentor can make it to the hangout. 3. to develop a mooc on how to publish a book. this is not to be intensive but encouraging, explaining the process of making a book from a to z. this will mean that industry specialists who may not be scratchers will have to be called in to talk to the students during the mooc. to encourage the children, perhaps those who participate may be given some certificate at the end of the mooc which will show that they have learned how to make a book (in theory) or some other form of motivational reward. 4. to create a website for this project under the same principle of a group of teacher-mentors to a group of interested students. 5. to develop a sign-up page for students to sign up for the various groups,for example, writers, illustrators, proofreaders, editors, publishers, marketing, communication, scratch debuggers, translators, website managers and so on. 6. when the project is completed, to create an awareness website for the advertisement of this book and the books to come. this will be also run by students with teacher-mentors. this website will provide links to scratch, scratchjr, scratched and other interesting educational website suggested byour scratchers. 7. when enough books have been published, a number to be agreed on by the bbs encouragement committee, to run an annual contest funded by kickstarter to award the top 3 books published per year. what do you think of this big idea? : )\\n\\n', '23708': 'just wondering if anybody local wants to meet up and talk shop. let

four different loops, try to combine the actions into one big loop. it\\'s possible to still \"subroutine\" out using broadcasts, but at least control the flow from one loop. then you won\\'t make yourself crazy trying to debug race conditions. one student was going crazy with debugging his program that had lots of independent loops and used \"on foo key pressed\". he combined his user

parallel loops. by that i mean, a lot of people use multiple when green flag clicked blocks in the same sprite\\'s code. this can create confusing errors and make long code hard to debug because you get confused over what part of the code is being executed at any given moment. this would be parallel coding. i encourage people to write all (or at least most) of their sprite\\'s code into a single, long block. it is far easier to make long or complicated code work and to find errors. i call this serial coding. in fact, it is a good idea to use as few when green flag clicked blocks a s possible

we\\'ve been exploring the ideas of parallelism and events. how would you explain these two concepts?\\n\\ni loved the display of paralell events in scratch. i was not aware that we could have scripts running together but not connected, so to speak. that was very helpful to design or create the scripts \"next\" to each other and have them occur simaltaneously or soon after an event! so parallelism is when things are happening at the same time and events are things that are going to be happening.\\n\\nparallelism is when actions occur at the same time. when scripts in scratch are executed at the same time. you can run parallel actions in scratch by using the same \"hat command\" to begin each script. events are actions that occur in a sequence, one after another. one event can lead to another event. in scratch to use events you can use one script that continues with multiple commands. you can also use the broadcast command to control the events.\\n\\nparallelism are events that can happen at the same time, either independently or inter-dependently. in scratch, each sprite can respond differently to a common event (broadcast). they can also send messages (boadcasts) to each other to trigger new events. this can be used to control timing/coordination between sprites. this is better than using delays (wait) which are static and are difficult to maintain when making changes to the project....\\n\\nparallelism is things occuring at the same time. your demonstration having one person being the programmer and then having other people being the sprites was very illustrative to me. iplan to use this with my students to show them how the scripts work. i love that you enlarged the commands and had them taped to the board. i was not aware that you could put scripts beside each to run parallel. the broadcast command is awesome. your demonstration also clearly illustrated events - which can be defined as actions, something happening. when designing scratch projects this concept is key to building projects that perform in the manner that you want.\\n\\nevents are happenings or scripts that are going to happen. parallelisms are events that occur at the same time, independently or in conjunction. the modeling of these concepts this morning was great. i am such a visual learning and the large scale model help it all to make sense. please post those blocks as a downloadable resource. i can see using these in groups within the classroom/lab setting. i want to be able to print them on cardstock to laminate and print them on magnetics to use on a whiteboard.\\n\\nparallelism is \"stuff\" happening at the same time. using scratch in a computer science course for a cross curriculum based project is an example of parallelism in the classroom. today\\'s example of demonstrating parallelism in programming with scratch was a great tool for my \"teacher tool box\". thankyou!\\n\\nin today\\'s lesson you explained parallelism to us as \"stuff happening at the same time\", and events as \"letting things know that something is going to happen\". i thought the lesson was brilliant--the human sprites and the taping of code to the white board slowed everything down and made important concepts really clear. stepping through and showing mistakes that one might make was also important. the timing of the lesson was also perfect for my needs--i had struggled with parallelism the evening before as i was working on some projects.\\n\\nparallelism is some \"thing\" happening at the same time. each coded script allows for this to occur using the applicable code fragments. these coded scripts can be grouped as stacks which allow the script\\'s execution to be faster. the event is letting the \"thing\" know that something is going to happen. the broadcast code allows all sprites to hear the message. then the command \"when i receive\" can be used to allow another happening. this is a very exciting approach to coding. i can envision my computer science newbies beginning their year with scratch. this code sets the stage for the logical thinking process needed to tackle other programming languages.\\n\\nparallelism is a concept that has rocked me to my programming core. having coded in cobol and event driven programming languages and being a very strong mono-tasker by nature i like controlling one thing at a time. my world is now filled with complication.\\n\\nan event is an occurrence which can be used to trigger the start of a stack of blocks. an event can be a generated by a broadcast, but it can also be generated by user input such as pressing a key or clicking the mouse.\\n\\n', '4811': \"i know this seems like a strange question for a scratch message board but i didn't know where else to ask. i've been teaching

numbers... more than 8300 and still counting... no limit? but cpu load was 40-50% on my old acer aspire 5110, where are the values stored? no increasing memory allocation... magic :) /anders\\n\\nthe practicle answer is that longer lists create longer wait times when opening or saving a scratch project. how long do you or others want to wait? usually, not very long at all. here is a link to one of my projects that uses several large lists. download it, then open it in scratch to see whati mean about slow loading. i split the data into several big lists instead of one huge list to make it easier to deal with whenm coding.\\n\\nnever used squeak but imagine its memory management is similar to other languages in which case your limit is the memory limits of the machine. modern machines have gigabytes of memory and 8300 numbers would only be kilobytes of space. the reason the memory allocation isn't increasing is becasue the memory manager would allocate blocks of memory. if you carried going you'd evenually see the memory usage increase but in large increments.\\n\\n\", '48230': \"dk is looking for a computer coding and education expert to write two teacher guides based on

about k-12 computer science for most states and school districts, the notion of computer science for every student is a relatively new and unexplored topic. responding to parent demand for their children to have access to computer science, theres been a major shift in thinking by states and school districts about how to make computer science part of core academic work. they are asking big questions of the computing community: what is the appropriate scope and sequence for k-12 computer science? what does the community expect every student to learn in elementary school, in middle school, or by the time they graduate high school? and why? csta, acm, and code.org are joining forces with more than 100 advisors within the computing community (higher ed faculty, researchers, and k-12 teachers, many of whom are also serving as writers for the framework), several states and large school districts, technology companies, and other organizations to steer a process to build a framework to help answer these questions. a steering committee initially comprised of the computer science teachers association, the association for computing machinery, and code.org will oversee this project. the framework will identify key k-12 computer science concepts and practices we expect students exiting grades 2, 5, 8, and 12 to know. this effort will not develop educational standards. we expect that states and school districts will use the framework to create their own frameworks, guidance, and standards, and the csta has its own independent process for developing detailed k-12 computer science standards. underpinning this effort is our belief that computer science provides foundational learning benefiting every child. computer science gives students a set of essential knowledge and skills important for students learning and for their future careers and interests. this work is about defining the basic expectations for what every student should have a chance to learn about k-12 computer science to prepare for the emerging demands of the 21st century  not just to major in computer science or secure jobs as software engineers. the projected release date for the framework is summer 2016. more information, including monthly updates and how to get involved, can be found at k12cs.org. mark nelson executive director of csta mehran sahami chair, acm education

challenges. the flip the cat debut it 3 challenge stumped them as it had a click sprite event, followed by turn blocks each turn right 90 degrees. with these 4 blocks, it is impossible to see the cat flip without putting a wait block in between the turns or using a repeat 4x block with 1 turn 90 and 1 wait. they really didn\\'t know how to guide the students. the debug 1.2 using glide and the debug 1.4 requiring students to explore also stomped my new cs teachers. do you have any advice to give the other than encouraging them to explore the blocks before class to solve the problems? kelly\\n\\nhi kelly! i have experience doing these challenges with both non-cs teachers, so equivalent to your new cs teachers, as well as students. in both situations, they were able to pick which challenges they wanted to tackle, moving freely among them in any order. i taught an online course for teachers in my district about creative computing/computational thinking and none of the participants were straight-up cs teachers. we tried out the debug it challenges. i found some responses from their own experiences about how they worked through the challenges. hopefully these might be helpful with your teachers. learning from peers/collaboration \"at first i tried out adding some different buttons, a new green flag, a repeat, etc. i then looked at other students revisions and saw what they did, which inspired me to instead use a new motion button, and i liked that the best!\" step away \"i found that if i took a break, i was much more inclined to solve the problem quickly. i chose to debug a couple of challenges in unit 4. i tried a few in the first two units but found the answers obvious and moved up a few levels.\" persistence \"i kept playing, tried different approaches and whallah! i finally got it to work. there is such a sense of gratification when you fix something!\" experimentation \"when i first read that we had to debug projects i thought i wouldn\\'t be able to do it! it turned out much easier than i anticipated and i felt successful. i thought the difficulty of the projects would increase a lot, but it seemed to stay a bit basic. i definitely appreciated that because i learned even more about the blocks, such as how to make a sprite flip. i also noticed myself thinking of the computational practices as i went through the exercises. how did i debug the projects? mostly through experimentation. when i was done though, i did look at other projects (reuse and remix). for the last debugging activity, i did get the cat to saw meow with the speech bubble, but it was slow. i noticed another classmate used different blocks to get the cat to talk faster. we both completed the activity, but in a different way. then i wondered, is one way the right way or does it matter if we both completed the project? i\\'m not sure it matters, but i think that we can learn a lot from each other.\" talking it out (and i would add in acting out the task) \"when debugging, in all areas of life, i talk to myself. a lot. with the debugging activities, i would read the instructions (sometimes incorrectly, as i discovered!), and then repeat the problem out loud in my own terms, and then go back and re-read one more time. from there, i would go to the activity, open the script to examine it, and run it to see if what actually happened would align with what i thought was wrong. next, id take a deeper look at the buggy script, and start experimenting with changing the blocks, testing after each change was made. it was similar to helping someone edit their video projects-- if theres a gap in their media, or their image fades too quickly, or their audio is out of sync: you have to debug. you have to keep trying things bit by bit, and then run it with each small change. and another vote for stepping away but sometimes, you have to step away and come back to it. you can get so deeply hung up on fixing one part that you lose sight of the entire project, and thats when its time to take a break. i mentioned this to ingrid-- that definition of insanity: insanity is when you keep doing the same thing and expecting different results...\" when you take some time to step back, look at the larger puzzle and all the other pieces in front of you, you can easily find the right fit. this happened for me in a few of the debugging activities here i took a break, went outside and shoveled snow, and came back in and suddenly the answer was right in front of me!\" ingrid and some awesome cps teachers\\n\\n',

(wow!, that was so simplistic) story starters get the reader hooked on continuing on and the middle of the story is the develpoment of the idea and the end just brings closure, in some way to the events. i was very interested in learning to create stories in scratch. i love the idea of combining a curricular goal with a computational goal or learning experiment. having said that, i am a bit stuck on how to keep the focus on writing and yet let them explore and have fun creating an animated story that is captivating to the reader. so, does scratch expand or limit the goal of storytelling.....hmmmmm? i think in some ways it is limiting because you spend so much time trying to get the characters to do what you want them to do, the content is lost. but, i also can see that stories can be brought to life and developed by being able to animate and be very creative about the story telling. ideas from the story may come from the programming of the characters themselves. i need to think about how to use scratch for storytelling. i love the idea but i am unclear about how to proceed.\\n\\ntelling stories using scratch is a way to get non technical students interested in using technology to tell their story in a different way. it is a medium that is not that difficult to learn, and lends itself to a lot of creativity, allowing students to express themselves besides writing...\\n\\ni also enjoyed the story telling with scratch. unfortunately, i haven\\'t been able to support our writing curriculum due to the fact that i see students once a week for 50 minutes blocks. it would be time comsuming to take a writing assigment from start to completion in the process that is utilizing in the classroom. i envision scratch as an avenue to champion writing in a different format. this is great for modification and differentiation. as a side benefit, i do not feel that the students will think that it is a long and drawn out process to go from start to completion within the scratch format, even if it takes them a month.\\n\\ni think scratch can expand what it means to tell a story for many people. the graphics and animations can help people express ideas in another way. people who struggle with writing can be very creative with telling stories using scratch. it could even help them devolop their strories that they write.\\n\\nthree famous story beginnings: once upon a time.1300s it was the best of times it was the worst of times charles dickens it was a dark and stormy night edward b. litton stephanie gayle asked us two important questions. what does my character want? what stands in my character\\'s way? great idea to help students to tell a story. scratch can be used to tell a story using parallel stacks. wonderful information we can use in our classrooms.\\n\\nare you looking for a fun new way to tell a story through technology? we found out today that scratch is the creative answer to illustrate, interact, and add dialog and sounds :).\\n\\ni was especially interested in using scratch to tell stories. at my school we have many projects that we ask the students to create stories based on content knowledge they have learned through their research. we teach them research skills and how to present their information as a research paper. then they are asked to teach their classmates about their their topic in the form of a story, the story is to both inform and entertain. this involves loads of creativity and they must script it out before sitting down at the computer - this project can easily be adapted to scratch. we currently use photostory and it works very well. but, now that i know (sort of) how to use scratch, i plan on having them use scratch for their second storytelling project. their final projects are shared with the entire class and then posted on our moodle site for others to see. by posting the the scratch website, their audience will be so much larger! scratch is more powerful than photostory!\\n\\ni loved the application of scratch into the storytelling process! ihave to admit that iam not the most creative person so searching through the backgrounds and sprites really helped me come up with ideas for my story. i think this would really help students who also struggle when asked to think up an original story . the collaborative story undertaking was my favorite part of the conference so far. i loved seeing how my story developed and this process again would help anyone who has a hard time thinking of a story idea, since the beginning or middle of the story has already been created . i think students would feel the same excitement that we did when viewing what our colleagues had done with our stories and i definitely plan on trying out this project with students during the upcoming school year.\\n\\non a rain free night in a mitdorm room a tired creative computing participant reflected on her day......... students won\\'t even realize they are writing when they are creating in scratch.scratch allows for even the most uncreative people to get creative. using the collaborative story telling scratch programming activity will be great fun in high school. the high level of engagement will be wonderful; i can only imagine what kind of funny stories that will be written through this creative outlet.\\n\\nafter reading the comments of 10 fellow participants, my head is spinning with ideas about how i might approach stories and scratch in my classroom. like vickie, i am thinking aboutadapting some projects that i had previously approached with photostory. in particular, i am thinking about using archival photos as backgrounds and asking the students to bring the photos to life with scratch. i think this will develop their visual awareness, and allow them todemonstrate historical knowledge they have gained through research.\\n\\ni agree that using scratch to create \"a product\" that synthesizes and incorporates information gathered during the research process would be a great library activity. to overcome time constraints, it could be a shared project between language arts, computer, (all the disciplines-for that matter), and library. telling a \"scratch story\" about content information will enable students to really learn deeply, and to share in each other\\'s learning, and to have fun!\\n\\nfamily stories and local history projects seem like a natural for this format. students can bring in their digitgal pictures (if they don\\'t have cameras, maybe send a less expensive camera home taking turns by the week, like the kindergarteners sometimes get to take a special toy home) and create narratives to go along with the pictures. they could do \"me projects\" with time sequences or a type of \"family tree\".\\n\\nwhen stephanie gayle introduced the topic of \"beginnings\", i thought of the recent newberry winning book by neil gaiman, the graveyard book, and its cast of unusual characters: there was a hand in the darkness, and it held a knife. i could see using scratch to explore the elements of a story-maybe a type of alternative book report.\\n\\nfinally (i like lotteries, too!) i agree that the variety of the sprites and their expressions, the backgrounds and the whole process encourage a more free flowing, fun process of story unfolding. i guess using a story board to preplan each step would be another approach, and i am sure a lot of preplanning goes into smany of the projects (in the gallery), but it was fun to interact with the given characters and the pieces that the other group members had added. it provided a more spontaneous way of engaging.\\n\\ni loved storytelling with scratch in our workshop. i especially liked the way the story changed -- partly because of the author switches, but also because scratch (the technology) drove the creativity which was driving the technology ... an infinite loop ... and therefore storytelling becomes a way to look at art/technology and brings us back to the question mitch asked earlier this week ... sneaky!\\n\\nit\\'d be interesting to use a story-telling approach also in math; if you\\'re aware of that, in scratch world or else, please tell me\\n\\ni searched google scholar forstorytelling and mathematicsand a few interesting articles were returned. i\\'m not sure if that\\'s the sort of thing you were looking for...\\n\\nit\\'s likely to be, i\\'ll go through it thanks\\n\\n', '11595': \"january 2012 webinar: my first scratch project wednesday, january 25, 2012? 7pm-8pm edt hosted by karen brennan

first, second, last, etc. good examples of this would be as in a concentration game or block busting game. thanks!! jen\\n\\nhi jennifer, one way to do this might be to create a variable like score that counts how many sprites you\\'ve clicked on. when the score reaches the total number of sprites, then you can broadcast the end of your game. here\\'s an example for adding a score variable to

games design course for hs students, and i have a vision of having all 12 kids sitting at computers in our school network, writing games in scratch. then, at the end of the period, they upload their games to a gallery i have created called 'hkisgamers', where we can all access them and play each other's creations that night from our homes. but here's the rub. 1) i have created the gallery, made it public access, but how do i get my kids to be able to find it to contribute their work? there is no 'search galleries' function. 2) if three or four kids all try to log on to their scratch accounts from different computers in our network, they end up being logged into someone else's account instead. apparently, i cant have multiple users from a single network on line simultaneously. 3) when someone tries to upload their game, the screen goes dark and they are told that they are trying to do an impossible task and told to restart. i have a sneaking feeling that this is related to #2. how do i achieve my vision of having a common, findable gallery where the kids can deposit their work while in school? m\\n\\nhi myron, i answered this in a different thread, but i'll repeat and extend here. :) 1) i have created the gallery, made it public access, but how do i get my kids to be able to find it to contribute their work? there is no 'search galleries' function. the scratch search (located at the top of the page, to the right) can be used to search for galleries. for example, i'm a teaching assistant for a course this term. i set up a gallery that i namedmas.714 2009. the participants can search formas.714 2009and filter or refine the results to include onlygalleries. (the options are for refining byusers,forums,projects,galleries, ordocumentation.) 2) if three or four kids all try to log on to their scratch accounts from different computers in our network, they end up being logged into someone else's account instead. apparently, i cant have multiple users from a single network on line simultaneously. that's really bizarre! you definitely should be able to have multiple users from a single network on scratch simultaneously. we do it fairly regularly in our research group -- and i've done it in schools. maybe you could try some controlled tests (one person on, add another person, etc.) to see where things are getting funky? 3) when someone tries to upload their game, the screen goes dark and they are told that they are trying to do an impossible task and told to restart. i have a sneaking feeling that this is related to #2. wow -- that's also really strange! could you give me a bit more information about what version of scratch you're running and in what type of configuration (type of machines, os, etc.)? how do i achieve my vision of having a common, findable gallery where the kids can deposit their work while in school? hopefully, that was answered by 1. but please don't hesitate to let me know if things aren't working or if you have other questions!\\n\\nhi karen: nice to hear from you. i'll thread my responses in allcaps. 1) i have created the gallery, made it public access, but how do i get my kids to be able to find it to contribute their work? there is no 'search galleries' function. the scratch search (located at the top of the page, to the right) can be used to search for galleries. for example, i'm a teaching assistant for a course this term. i set up a gallery that i namedmas.714 2009. the participants can search formas.714 2009and filter or refine the results to include onlygalleries.

2. for the beginners i had a lot of fun working with the people who were having their very first scratch experiences. here are some resources that you might want to check out, to support your further explorations with scratch. getting started guide - how to make a first scratch project. scratch cards - twelve cards that illustrate a basic scratch technique (such as keeping score or playing with graphic effects). design studio activities - 16 suggestions for design activities, such as making a project that includes the \"random\" block or making a project that has an orange square and purple circle. creative computing workshop - this is something i just finished -- i haven\\'t event posted the sum as a resource on scratched yet! this is a sequence of activities for getting started with scratch. any feedback on the sequence and activities would be appreciated. how could it be changed to be more useful? 3. future events there are lots of ways to keep participating in scratched professional development: hang out on scratched come to the monthly meetups - register for next month\\'s meetup and be notified about future events through the quarterly newsletter. attend the monthly webinars - the next webinar is all about scratch day and is taking place on monday, february 28 at 7pm est. 4. what\\'s next? we asked people to record their thoughts about what might be next for them and might be next for our next meetup. here\\'s what was shared on sticky notes: experimenting!

m\\n\\nomar, scratch is great for introducing and reinforcing so many programming concepts. here are some ideas from the scratched community: 1. design an interactive pencil that wears down and draws thicker lines as it writes(animation with costume changes) 2. create a magic 8 ball that shakes and answers questions (lists, variables and random numbers) 3. design a project using only an orange circle and purple square with each of these projects you will be amazed at the variations and how quickly students learn the concepts independently. if your time is limited, assign the sprite creations for homework or limit the number of sprites. scratchers get easily drawn in to the sprite and background designs.\\n\\ni recently created a hangman game and i found it surprisingly complex in scratch and i required a few workarounds. there might be simpler approaches (i was using a different sprite for each letter, and so had to convert letters into costume numbers via a list) but i'm not sure it's ideal for beginners. i'll take a look at that resource michelle has recommended to see how they did it! :-) scratch takes care of collision detection which is hard in many other programming languages, so scratch is well optimised for making arcade style games, and there's a lot of latitude in how sophisticated they can be, so students can tailor their game to their own level of expertise and curiosity. an arcade game might be the obvious thing to try. i ran a session for adults recently where i got them to write a game where balls bounce around randomly, and the cat has to dodge them. that had quite a small scope but still provided a reasonable challenge to them. it took them about an hour to do, using a guided worksheet that gave hints and tasks. quite simple things can pose a challenge too. i got my group to work out how to draw a circle, after showing them the drawing tools and the repeat tool. that required the kind of creative thinking that programmers routinely do, and proved quite challenging as a warm-up.\\n\\n\", '11754': 'does anyone know if lego simple and motorized machines iscompatible with scratch? link below to the lego product. thank you. lego education simple machines\\n\\nhi eleanor, i asked mitch and john (the lead developer of scratch) and here is how they responded: comment from mitch: this kit includes a motor and light, and includes a battery box for controlling them. to control these elements from a computer, you would also need the \"controller\" that comes with the lego wedo kit -- or you can buy this controller (officially known as the lego usb hub) separately (http://www.legoeducation.us/eng/product/lego_usb_hub/1655). comment from john: i assume that the motor could be plugged into a wedo hub and controlled from scratch. scratch doesn\\'t have a block to control the light.\\n\\njust fyi. i and friends are working to make an inexpensive robot kit named nanoboardag now. the target price is under $40. it includes all bricks and devices (motor, controller, etc). nanoboardag is based on arduino and compatible with wedo and picoboard. http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/abee/2297128 http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/haru88/2312017 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kafa-vdtmzm we hope to bring it to next scratch@mit. p.s. scratch 1.4 can control lego pf light 8870 by motor blocks with a little modification. here is a mod that include it. http://squeakland.jp/abee/tmp/sensorboardwithmotor.zip\\n\\n', '32199': \"the weekly roundup is where the scratched team shares some of the major -- as well as some of the overlooked -- news, stories, and events related to scratch that took place throughout the week. scratched weekly roundup 01/31/15 - 02/06/15 the creative computing curriculum guide is now available in korean!

it would definitely be a pity if children are either directed to use the old scratch or the very limited wedo software. actually (...and now i almost feel rude for mentioning it) - i was in fact hoping that scratch 2.0 would address not only lego wedo but also the \"next step\", namely lego mindstorms. mindstorms is the closest there is to a de facto standard for robitics for kids out there. dare i ask if scratch+mindstorms is even mentioned among the developers? (note: i\\'m aware of the enchanting modification for mindstorms but this is not only based on scratch). thank you very much (...and i\\'m really hoping wedo will be prioritized) /mat\\n\\nthanks - something similar to the remote sensor protocol would be great, there are projects like scratchconnect (yengawa.com/scratchconnect) that use the existing remote sensor protocol to good end. hardware projects like wedo, picoboards, sunspots, mindstorms, arduino are all extremely useful if ther\\'es a way to hook into them using scratch for workshops and various projects. thanks so much for keeping remote sensor protocol on the drawing board as a to do item for scratch 2.0! best regards, -- dang\\n\\nhi, mat. we plan to support the wedo and scratch sensor board, as in scratch 1.4. we also plan to extend the wedo support over time to to support multiple wedo hubs and control over multiple motors. and, in the long term, we\\'ll make it possible others to connect scratch to other sensors and devices (e.g. the microsoft kinect) with a mechanism similar to the current remote sensors protocol. however, we want to get scratch 2.0 lauched as soon as possible,so it may launch without some or all of these features and they will be introduced over time. as of now, we don\\'t plan to do anything with scratch and lego mindstorms -- but thanks for the suggestion. note that, unlike the wedo, mindstorms is npt designed to remain \"tethered\" to the user\\'s computer, so once the mindstorms was programmed it would not interact with scratch. it would be nice to have scratch-like tool for programming the mindstorms, but such a tool would be better as it\\'s own thing, rather than as an extension of scratch. -- john\\n\\njohn, thank you for your reply and the positive news on lego wedo + 2.0 !!! lego mindstorms: actually it features bluetooth so it can be interacting with the computer directly, as far as i understand.

initiative and i am working with our teachers with some \"out of the box\" ideas to integrate into the google classroom and just tech things in general. that brought me to this idea. what if i wrote a program that the teachers could use to take their class lists and split them into random teams/groups (teams of 2,3 or 4). study guides, subject reviews, etc, groups all randomly generated which will push kids to interact with the classmates they don\\'t normally interact with and just to spice things up. i created 8 import lists (for now), those never get touched after you import your .txt file, they are just referred to by the selection list. that then randonly chooses the teams dependent on how many teams are chosen. i plan to incorporate the whole school soon, prek-8, so those teachers and the phys ed teachers can use this random team/group generator. in my tech class the demo for 7th grade was a hit, they loved the \"lottery\" of where they would end up and how teams/groups were so different every time. feel free to use if you\\'d like. directions: create a .txt file for each of your homerooms import that to one of the import lists, just keep track of what sprite handles what list. probably create a new costume for each selection sprite so your class names are displayed properly the program does the rest. i do plan on offering an option for 1 team, or one randomized order.

little confusing topic with a sprite and its directions... i mean i understand it, but... i draw naturally a sprite with direction pointing upwards (my little bug). but when i use direction in my script the direction must be 90. isnt it more natural to think 0 was pointing upwards. no big deal, but when you explane to the children, when they are going to move this little bug and face the bug to the right, and left and so on... it starts to be a little bit confusing. if the bug is going up direction is 90 (right), and if its down -90 (left)... maybe i am missing something obvious... and the snow we got yesterday... is melting, raining today. so it might be natural with up to the right and down to the left... ;) have a nice weekend, anders\\n\\nyah, i don\\'t like how the directions were implemented at all. according to scratch 90 is right -90 is left 180 is down 0 is up but i don\\'t quite understand why that makes sense or why it was choosen that way. it is like the whole system was rotated 90 degress to the left\\n\\nyes, you are totally right. it might be something about western world of thinking. everything (text) from left to right. i understand and accept 0 as being up (the circle starts from 0 up). but when i make a sprite its not that easy... so is it a bug or something i really dont understand.\\n\\nright, so no matter what the image looks like .. the initial position of it is set to 90. to help with confusing students i guess i would suggest always drawing their sprites to face right. i don\\'t think this is a bug -- i think this is how scratch

great lesson for me... thank you very much... so let me see if i understand what you all are saying here: i love geometry by the way... :-) and at this very momenti am looking at a student protractor (i still draw with a pencil and paint on canvas...) the protractor, based similarly to thex and y axes of traditional graphs in math, puts zero degrees at 9 o\\'clock, 90 degrees at 12 o\\'clock and 180 degrees at 3 o\\'clock... so what you all are saying is that scratch puts a value of zero at the 90 degree mark/angle of/on a protractor? ...in terms of movement/motion direction of the sprite...? that is plenty for me to ask right now... and appreciate any reply/confirmation of my \"description\"/\"analysis\" of what you are saying... thanks, it is an honor and pleasure to be here, to learn

spent the 2 hour drive back to the bucolic monadnocks thinking about what a powerful tool scratch is. on the surface, it is so cool that kids can replicate and invent media experiences they are currently consuming... but the transformative aspect of the tool is all about shifting our mental models about what it means to be about a learner/creator. this tool might allow us to begin to ask different questions in the classroom mmm... \"what is interesting about this?\" when we heard the story about the math deficient student who had the number line, positive-negative numbers aha moment making his scratch, it was just another chiming bell reminding us that 1 size does not work. let\\'s advocate adding scratch to a list of options to demonstrate mastery of a concept! iwas also very attunned to the fact that, a la prensky, most of us are digi immigrants. a huge factor in allowing tools like scrach to become more ubiquitous and pervasive is the need to realign the teacher\\'s head so that they don\\'t need to understand the technical level of what is happening. my most satisfied teachers are as gee-whiz about the coolness factor of the final project as the kids and they are happy to see the key learning objectives articulated in the scratch project. the best teachers - keep their hands in their pockets and ask, \"what do you want to do with what you just observed?\" lastly, the need for us to honor and respct that we are homo ludens. we play to learn. we need most to transform/unlearn the behaviors that most teachers are judged by. defeat the bell, the segmentation by discipline and we start new trails of inquiry!\\n\\ni think your point about letting go of the technical level is interesting and important. while they don\\'t need to be in control of (or understand) every aspect of interactions with scratch, i do think it\\'s important for educators to have a strong sense of the possible. what can scratch help me and my students achieve? how to communicate that space of possibility for people is an interesting challenge!\\n\\nha! i got so wrapped up in responding to your post that i didn\\'t say thanks. thanks for coming to yesterday\\'s workshop -- it was great to see you there!\\n\\nhi. i hope you don\\'t mind me sharing some thoughts. yesterday, i had ninja35 and audifreak with me and we were having a children\\'s day party. one of the things we had to do was a shared scratch project. i started by teaching audifreak how to draw a kingfisher by copying from a picture of one. she continued with the drawing and ninja35 contributed his input. then we decided to have some fun and made it into a game. i left the kids to complete it and they had great fun. http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/audifreak/698625 the children learned how to work together as a team and they learned different scratch skills from one another as one took over when the other got stuck. i think that scratch is such a wonderful tool for team projects as well as for individual projects. i believe that if you form the children into teams where each team comprises students with differing levels of scratch skills, they will learn very fast from one another. i guess that the facilitator or teacher must be vigilant to ensure that the more adept student does not take over completely but learns to teach the younger (in terms of skill) scratch students.\\n\\n',

i want to set up accounts for my children in years 5 and 6 to use. any help much appreciated. thanks.\\n\\nyes, i would be very interested to hear if a classroom management system has been set up as well.\\n\\ni recommend letting kids create their own username and email (if they have one), especially if you think anyone might want to use scratch outside of class. if they are under age 13, educators might have students use the teacher\\'s email or set up a class email to use. i\\'ve heard educators say that they prefer having students use the teacher\\'s email because any notifications of inappropriate content will be sent to the email on file for the account. another option is to have young students create profiles at home with a parent or guardian providing an email. this could be assigned for homework with a letter home about scratch and a place to fill in the chosen username and password -- so teachers can keep a master list on hand just in case a student forgets their account info. note: the mit scratch team is developing \"educator accounts\" to help educators create and manage student/class acounts. they plan to release this feature later this year. hope that helps! i\\'d love to hear other ideas. michelle chung, on behalf of the scratched team\\n\\nby \"later this year\" i hope you mean before september :) in any case, excellent news.\\n\\ni\\'m very open to an educator\\'s account. i think that rolling out scratch accounts per class may be a little daunting from a child protection/internet safety perspective. i would want to have some element of control as to what my students \\'share\\' with the rest of the world. i do hope that the educator\\'s accounts do allow us to make a more \\'closed-off\\' community whereby only specific members can view and comment, ben matthews\\n\\ni look forward to having a classroom management system. in the interim i created separate accounts and passwords for each of my students in grades 4 - 6. the usernames included the school initials, the grade level, and the students initials.(for example: gs4tm ) i typed the usernames and passwords that i created for students into a google spreadsheet that we often refer to. i used my email address for all of the accounts. this account is for projects that we are doing in class. some students have their own personal account for scratch that they\\'ve set up with their families.\\n\\nhi lorraine, i have done the same for all of my 5th grade aprox 100 students. and i have also used the same formula for username.the problem i am having now is organizing their projects. i created studios for each class but inviting each student to be a curator has been quite budensome and time consuming. wondering how you are handling viewing and keeping track of you student\\'s projects and monitoring comments?\\n\\nsandy, i logged into each of the students accounts and created a \\'placeholder project\\' with the project title and the students initials. (this is a project that the students worked on for four weeks.) then i created a scratch account and a studio for each of the three grade levels. i added each of the placeholder projects to the studios. (this set up is time consuming.) when i go to the studios i see all of the projects from that grade level . i haven\\'t figured out a way to monitor the comments without clicking on each one of them. it will be helpful to have a classroom management system.\\n\\nare there any updates about the educator accounts or classroom management system? i just created accounts for 2 classes using a class email so my students could have their own \"scratch space\" and be able to save their work, but it was tedious. looking forward to an easier way to manage classes. marty\\n\\nstill waiting on news on educator accounts. creating accounts for several students is very time consumimg.\\n\\nwe don\\'t have an update yet on educator accounts, but we will post as soon as we know. thank you all for your patience!\\n\\nis there an update regarding scratch educator accounts? i am getting ready to teach a summer school class and would be interested in a classroom management tool. does anyone have a sample letter that can be sent to parents asking parents to establish scratch accounts for students?\\n\\na possible solution could be to use multiple email addresses in gmail. gmail - conveniently - ignores anything after a + for instance an email sent to me@gmail.com, me+student1@gmail.com, me+student2@gmail.com show up in me\\'s inbox. of course you will have to create an account in scratch for each of your students. the students, on the other hand, will not be needing their own personal email accounts. you can further \\'filter\\' your emails and direct them to folders set up as student1, student2, student3, etc. i hope i didn\\'t miss the mark on this post. i signed up for scratch a day ago and i\\'m excited. you guys are awesome!!\\n\\nthe mit scratch team is hoping to release the educator account feature later this fall. we\\'ll keep posting any updates we hear.\\n\\nany update on the classroom/educator accounts?\\n\\ni wonder if this is even still on the table. marty\\n\\nthe mit scratch team is hoping to release the educator accounts by the end of this year, or in early 2015. stay tuned for more info!\\n\\nthanks for the update michelle. wating anxiously for this add-on. it will be a huge step toward providing access to scratch for students, particularly those under 13, and toward encouraging wider educational use by making interaction and monitoring a bit more streamlined for teachers.\\n\\nthis is good news, indeed! looking forward to learning more! marty\\n\\nmichelle, is there an update on the timeline for this yet? i\\'m hoping to use it with a class after our winter break; we are back in session on jan. 6. marty\\n\\nany updates on student accounts for scratch 2.0? hoping to hear something soon. marty h\\n\\nhi marty, unfortunately, no updates. i promise to post an update here as soon as i know anything. sincerely, k\\n\\ni\\'m interested in that as well.\\n\\nthere are obviously lots of people who would find this really useful - i really hope that the educator feature becomes available soon. any news, scratch?! thank you:)\\n\\nyes - this would be a big breakthrough for using scratch in the classroom. i\\'d love to set up a closed class studio where all the projects could be posted and viewed. right now it\\'s too cumbersome to do this with all the workarounds. that said, i cannot understate how wonderful scratch is as a resource and i thank you a million times.\\n\\nyes, my students were very frustrated yesterday because they couldn\\'t save their work. they are lower school students with no email accounts. my understanding was that the classroom management component of scratch was in the works and supposed to be rolled out over a year ago. marty\\n\\ni am going to experiment with students saving their scratch files on our network and then uploading them back to the scratch website. this is not ideal and does not address the community aspect of scratch, but at least students will be able to save their work. all of my students know how to save a file to their documents and retrieve them. it eliminates having to use a third party application. it would be nice if it was easy to create student accounts but i can\\'t have each child have to use their parents\\' personal email account and then wait for parents to respond. i don\\'t have to do that for any other subscription we have. instead of a studio on the scratch website, students will have a scratch files folder on our network. i will let you know how this works. marty\\n\\nyes, that\\'s what i have been doing till now, marty. it works but is rather annoying to have to do this every time - and would be much better to have the ability set up online classroom accounts (easily!)\\n\\nbarbara & marty, if you are already saving scratch projects to your network, why not add the scratch app to your computers? i asked my it guy to do just that, so now students store their projects on the server and work with the download version of scratch on our lab desktop computers bypassing the online version all together... at least until scratch figures out the student account issue that is the theme of this thread. good luck, tim\\n\\ngood idea, tim. the download/upload option has worked pretty well and my students are happy they can save their projects. we had the old 1.4 scratch version downloaded on to the student computers. i will ask our it guy to replace it with the 2.0 version and bypass the online version until a solution is provided. thanks, tim. marty\\n\\nany update on the classroom/educator accounts?\\n\\nlooks like educator accounts has been over two years in development... is it now dead or is there still a chance that it could happen?\\n\\nwhat is happening with the scratch classroom accounts? i\\'m frustrated by the lack of progress on this. should i have students create the accounts at home with their parents or should i use my own school email account? there should be a way to easily create accounts for middle school and younger students. marty\\n\\ni don\\'t need a whole manangement system- just a way to easily create accounts from a csv file would be great! this was something that scratch users at the 2014 conference were very vocal about, so i have been hopeful, but so far... nothing.\\n\\nhi. im christan balch, the online community coordinator on the scratch team at mit. we understand your frustration with the registration process for students, and were sorry for the difficulties that it has caused for you and your students. were continuing to work on teacher accounts, which we hope will simplify the process of creating accounts for your students. unfortunately, the development of the teacher accounts has taken much longer than we expected. we hope to have more news about the accounts soon. well make sure to post messages on scratched to keep you informed. in the meantime, we suggest using a single email address (e.g., a teachers email address) to register and approve all of your student accounts. (multiple scratch accounts can share the same address.) we realize that the confirmation process can be time-consuming for educators, but confirmation is just a one-time process when first registering an account. sorry again for the current difficulties. we hope to have better solutions in the future. please do feel free to reach out to me should you have more questions. thanks!\\n\\nhi christian. could you just clarify the procedure for creating multiple accounts with one email address. do i do this on the main scratch website and not through my educator account? i have created a generic email address for our school to use and need to set up about 15 accounts initially for a club i want to run. i\\'m assuming i just create an account using my generic adddress on the main scratch website (https://scratch.mit.edu/) and then the procedure to create mutliple accounts will be an option to select? thank you for your help. joanna\\n\\nhello christan, has there been any news on student accounts? and or teacher accounts? thank you. speete35\\n\\nwhat is the word on class accounts? i have a group of 4th graders beginning a class project which they will collaborate actoss classrooms for. we used to be able to login with one class account, but now it is bumping off multiple users. i just need to be able to manage a group of students for class purposes. i either need the classroom functions to work or to allow multiple users of the same account, please. this is a much loved project that i would hate to have die because of difficulties at the site\\'s end. please advise.\\n\\ni currently have my students create their own accounts, but i have them use my school address for the email. this way, when they forget their password while at school, i can quickly help them reset it. the probelm is when they forget it during the summer and i have to figure out how to contact them once i have reset it... i am sure the folks at mit are workigng on fabulous teacher features, but in the meantime, if they would just give us a simple way to upload a csv file to create the accounts, that would be awesome!\\n\\nhi christan, i have been asking about teacher management accounts in scratch for a couple of years, as have many other teachers. saying \"we hope to have better solutions in the future\" is a pretty discouraging thing to read, when so many people are asking for this feature, loudly and clearly. will it happen in the next two months? thanks, pauel craton\\n\\nhi karen, do you know if there have been any updates to this topic? i fairly recently found the workaround i had been using will no longer work, and we are about to start a huge collaborative scratch project with the entire 4th grade (so, no, they don\\'t have their own email addresses). i read here that one teacher\\'s workaround was to have each student create an account with her email address, but i don\\'t really want to create accounts for every 4th grader with my email address, particularly because i would have to do it for 3rd graders and 2nd graders as they begin their scratch projects.... downloading and uploading is what i\\'ve been left with, but that can get finicky, too.. thank you for any help and/or guidence you can offer.\\n\\nhi christan, do you know if there have been any updates to this topic?

best, claudia\\n\\nreplies to claudia and anders: i\\'mglad to have found this forum. although scratch isn\\'t new here i don\\'t know anyone who has worked with the picoboard or external sensors.i love math and know a bit about programming . claudia , thanks for your answer! from below you can see i had already seen your name somewhere!i am very sad to say my laptop was stolen last year but its still all in my head and will be happy, if you\\'re interested and given time to share code examples. anyway i hope to redo some projects this year as well as try new ones. wow,theidea you shared has everything to do with my views on the use of scratch and i actually did that last year except for the humidity sensor! we saved data ( for example pairs of numbers, time and temperature )in lists , exportedas text,then opened with excel and did all kinds of graphs. found out aboutscratch before it was actually introduced in my country, loved it, tried to learn as much as i couldwhen i could ( time\\'s always scarce...)and am still doing so.portugal actually has its ownscratch site only very recently updated with scratch 1.4.there is a very comendable organization of teachers here around scratch.however, although scratch is greatfor story telling and gettinglittle kids to learn basic programming skills, here i haven\\'t really seen its useadvisedfor older kids.it has been mostly \"promoted\" for use in math with 5th and 6th graders and before i prove them wrong some of my pupils say its \" kiddy stuff\",which is a pity when you canalsocreate interesting programs using more advanced conceptswith grades 7all the way up to12 ( get kids to create \"missing operators\" with exponential and logarithmic functions...) hope to hear from you claudia! here are some ideas iused: turned a bycycle upside down, taped a magnetic sensor to one part of the bike and a little magnet to the wheel.the idea was to get the wheel to spin for a bit and calculatethings like:distance \"travelled\", speed and rotations per minute. got the idea from the gadget on my husband\\'s mountain bike. withthe temperature sensor got it close to really hot or cold things and with pre-recorded kids\\' voices you could hear \" it\\'s soooo hot\" or \"it\\'s sooo cold.\" i had thought of a \" talking\" plant who would complain if its soil was too dry but didn\\'t find a humidity sensor in portugal ( resistive humidity sensor). i\\'m going to order from rhopoint but it\\'s going to really cost me because of shipping.do youknow if can use this sensor to measure soil humidityas well as air humidity? another hare brained ideai didn\\'t get to try was a doll with a humidity sensor on an adapted diaper. she would cry out \"change me\" when water you put in her mouth trickled down to the diaper... with four mercury switches taped to a plate which was then covered with transparent hardcase with holesas a precaution andwe simulated a steering wheel which controlled a car on the screen. we were very, very careful but the wedo tilt sensor is of course the way to go. we also filled the screen with flowers of various colours and with the light sensor placed on the screen there was this little bumble bee which flew to where the sensor was.there was only one flower of each colour and at any given time the scratch program knew exactly what flower the light sensor was on. anders, thanks for the info. i haven\\'t tried mesh but it seems to be the only way tocontrolmore than one wedo kit. of course you\\'d need morethan one computer but with shared variables and broadcasts there are a lot ofpossibilities...regarding resistance,for examplei used temperature sensor 10 k ohm, light sensor 5k to 20 h ohm. electronics isn\\'t my specialty but after finding the followinginfo i ordered a picoboard and later on managed to get the external sensors in portugal except the humidity sensor. hope the following info answers some of your questions. sorry for enormous post.please excuse any errors! very best regards, ana santos from sensor types and sources:i knewyour name was familiarclaudia! the following list shows different types of sensors that have been used in scratch sensor board projects.

(experimentally determined; your mileage may vary.) from http://scratch.mit.edu/forums/viewtopic.php?id=6403: 17. how do the sensors convert their input to values between 0-100? from the technical info document: \"scratch maps the 10-bit sensor data onto a 0 _ 100 scale using a mapping that is different for each sensor type. users can access the raw 10-bit values by shift-clicking on the scratch board watcher and selecting report raw data . doing so will show sensor values in the range 0 - 1023. most of the sensors use a generic linear conversion to report scaled values between 0 - 100. light and sound sensors use piecewise linear functions that take into account the idiosyncrasies of those sensors. (note that readings for light are reversed so that more light gives larger values.) code for scaling functions [are]: code: generic(n) return round ((100 * n) / 1023) light(n) if n < 25 return 100 - n else return round((1023 - n) * (75 / 998)) sound(n) //empirically tested noise sensor floor n = max(0, n - 18) if (n < 50) return n / 2 //noise ceiling return 25 + min(75, round((n - 50) * (75 / 580)) ) //noise floor and ceiling values might vary 18. um. ok. but in reality, how do the resistance values relate to the sensor value? is it linear? nope. it\\'s not linear. it\\'s logarithmic. from experiments on our board, the resistance sensor value (0-100) that the picoboard produces is related to the actual resistance, r, (in kohms) across the alligator clips by the something like the following equation: sensor value = a*ln(b*r+1) where, approximately: a=19.5 b=0.9 but, if you are only interested in low resistance values between 0-10 kohm, the following simple relation works real well (and yep, it\\'s linear): sensor value = a*x, where a is approximately 5.57\\n\\nhi ana thanks for your reply. i have orded 10 picoboards recently (waiting for delivery), so i will definitly try some of your ideas. probably next year (if i can get a teacher interested ;)... or try with some afterschool activity) ....and i want to experiment with an arduinoboard as well... so many wishes and time is spread around all over the place, and i dont know how to catch it...\\n\\nhi anders! how i know what you mean! i\\'m also interested inthe arduino board and arduino robotics. from what i\\'ve gathered its actually much cheaper than the picoboard but the learning curve will be verydifferentbecause thec type language isn\\'t nearly as \"kid friendly\"as scratch.i suppose kids would have to be 12 at the very least... by the way, it snowed in portugal on november 30. havent seen any because i live in the center near the coast.\\n\\n\"i\\'m also interested in the arduino board and arduino robotics. from what i\\'ve gathered its actually much cheaper than the picoboard but the learning curve will be verydifferentbecause thec type language isn\\'t nearly as \"kid friendly\"as scratch. \" hi guys, i\\'m new to this forum and all about educational technology. you guys should check out modkit if you haven\\'t heard about it already. it\\'s made by these awesome guys who want programming arduino to be as easy as scratch. it\\'s going public very soon. check it out. also- i have been developing a scratch project to teach about arduino. it\\'s definitely not nearly done, but the idea is there. i have been poking around a little and was unable to find anything like this on the site. i would love to share it with people in the hopes that they will take it, make it better, use it for their own classes, whatever. like i said i haven\\'t posted it yet (got a lot of other stuff going on) but i will shortly. i would also love to hear more about what people are doing with scratch (and definitely arduino) and the school systems.\\n\\nhi lindsay yes its interesting with the arduinoboard. if i use a photoresistor with picoboard its easy to get started and understand what is happening (i will soon try the picoboard with kids aged 11-13, a small techproject). but the picoboard is too expensive (escpecially if you live in sweden and order 10 boards, i had to pay somekind of importtax nearly 100 _, puh :(....). so the arduinoboard would be perfect. but its not so easy to get going for kids. there is a little bit higher learningcurve before you are up and creating. i would be nice if you share your arduino-experiences with us. the s4a - scratchclone is interesting http://seaside.citilab.eu/scratch/arduino and the modkit will be really promising... i stumble upon this nice video about arduino and 8-11 years old girls... even more promising :) not sooo much scratch, but the idea is nice... http://vimeo.com/4313755 hmmm... i couldnt embed the video...\\n\\nhi guys (in particular anders), i work for sparkfun electronics. i recently posted an arduino teaching tool i have been working on in my free time here: http://scratch.mit.edu/galleries/view/110387 it\\'s a little complicated if you don\\'t have experience with arduino or scratch or a similar product, but read the project notes for some quick instructions if you are interested. it is a ruff draft and i posted it in the hopes that other educators would understand the idea and download for further development. feel free to use it however you like and please post any improvements to the gallery. dedicated to educating- linz\\n\\nhi lindsay i will dig into your arduino teaching tool... im a newbie in the arduinoarea, but its fun and interesting. i tried the s4a-clone today, and it works well even with one arduino - uno and a picoboard connected at the same time. but im waiting for the modkit as well... and the best part of everything is that i started a tech/scratchclub as an afterschool activity (not so common in sweden...) and have 6-10 interested kids (probably more, when the words are spread). so i will work with picoboards first... but if they are interested... arduino. and the kinect hack... for scratch. so it will be an interesting spring :)\\n\\n', '11227': 'hi everyone, i\\'m really happy to let you know that scratched is (mostly) up and running again. of course, i\\'m expecting bugs to pop up here and there -- if you notice anything, please don\\'t hesitate to let me know. bug reports are always welcome!

last summer i had the privelege of teaching a 2-day game design course to a room full of approximately 25 6th graders. not knowing how in the world i could possibly teach anything worth while in 2 half-day sessions, i turned to an online forum where several people recommended the scratch programming environment. not only was scratch easy for me as an instructor to pick up and learn, but the wealth of resources on the education site made it easy to find material to present to the class. what i really wanted to avoid was spending 2 hours hunting down a missing semicolon (which is likely what would have happened if i went with a more \"traditional\" programming language). as a relatively new educator in a rural community, it was a very gratifying experience to get young people excited about computer science through game design. i even had students come to me saying that they didn\\'t want to go to their next sessions so they could stay and work on their scratch projects. i\\'m very proud of my group of budding computer scientists and look forward to investigating new ways of using scratch inside and outside the classroom!

was the scratch team invoved with this at all? will this affect plans for scratch in the future? for teaching lower and middle school, i\\'m now inclined to start with scratch and then use app inventor. it seems like it would be a great transition. peter r.\\n\\nmembers of the mit scratch team have been sharing ideas with the google app inventor team over the past year. the two projects have many similar goals and visions, though app inventor has focused explicitly on the special features and affordances of mobile phones. some of our discussions with the app inventor team could influence how we think about future versions of scratch -- particularly, the ways that scratch organizes, accesses, and interacts with online data. mitch resnick, mit scratch team\\n\\nfascinating. thank you for the response mitch.\\n\\nsamsung had a a special version of scratch that ran on samsung and nokia phones by making a jar file that could be installed directly on a phone. this is now gone and mitare really missing a trick by not redeveloping this for scratch 1.4 (which has variable size stage) - it is possible simply to run a scratch app on a mobile phone using java if someone does the right tweaks to get it to run. can we have this soon please ??\\n\\nwe agree that it would be good to have a version of scratch running on mobile phones. john maloney, the lead software developer for scratch, has invested some time investigating the possibilities for scratch on mobile devices, and he points to several challenges: * performance. many mobile devices don\\'t have sufficient performance to run scratch well. that was one of the problems with the samsung version. * screen size. it\\'s not easy to squeeze the scratch ui onto the small screen of a mobile device. our feeling is that a totally different ui would be needed to author scratch projects on a mobile device. (of course, it is easier to create a scratch player, with no authoring capabilities, for a small screen.) * lack of standards. there is a lot of variability among mobile devices, so it would be difficult to make a version of scratch that works on many different types of mobile devices. * legal issues. a third-party software developer created a scratch player for the iphone and ipad, but apple decided not to allow it, as part of its policy against apps that interpret or execute code. here\\'s our reaction to apple\\'s decision. * our time. the mit scratch team is a relatively small group, so we need to focus our efforts. right now, we are focusing most of our development effort on creating a new version of scratch that runs inside web browsers. we hope that this new version will support new types of scratch projects (e.g., accessing online data) and new types of collaborations. as we work on this new version, we will keep looking for opportunities to bring scratch to mobile devices. mitch resnick (for the mit scratch team)\\n\\n', '11780': \"the weekly roundup is where the scratched team shares some of the major -- as well as some of the overlooked -- news, stories, and events related to scratch that took place throughout the week. scratched weekly roundup 01/28/12 - 02/03/12 have you submitted a proposal for the scratch@mit conference this summer?

3. breakouts mitch wrote a brief description of the breakout session he led around \"challenges\" (check out the activity and a demonstration video): in the breakout group, which had about 10 people, we divided time between hands-on \"challenges\" and discussion. the challenges were designed to explore different ways of adding interactivity to a scratch project. for example, one challenge was: \"whenever a sprite hears a sound, it changes color.\" everyone in the breakout created scripts in response to the challenge, then compared the different approaches used by different people. we discussed how the challenges could be used in the classroom -- and, more broadly, what types of activities are best for connecting with students\\' interests, while also helping them learn important computational ideas. cameron wrote a brief description of the breakout session he led around \"computational thinking\": we had an engaging discussion of the various concepts and principles that comprise ct. to guide our discussion, i utilized the big ideas of computational thinking outlined by the scratch team. to shape our discussion and examine ct from both a theoretical and applied perspective, we addressed the first two of three ct big ideas, concepts, and practices. in terms of ct concepts, we examined how scratch provides useful concepts that are directly applicable to computer programming and that these blocks (such as loop, event, operator, and variable blocks) generate an accessible entry point for thinking about ct with scratch. next, we discussed the various ct practices. these four practices, incremental/iterative, testing/debugging, reusing/remixing, and abstracting/modularizing, are ideas that can be both applied to computer programming and core content areas within the primary and secondary school setting. a third breakout session focused on a discussion of video games. 4. future events there are lots of ways to keep participating in scratched professional development: ask questions and find resources here on scratched attend columbia\\'s scratch day event on may 14 come to the monthly meetups at mit - next month\\'s meetup is a bit different, as it coincides with scratch day. registration for scratch day mit opens tomorrow morning. susan ettenheim is seeing who might be interested in arranging a bus to the event attend the monthly webinars - the next webinar is all about computational perspectives and is taking place on monday, april 23 at 7pm est. participate in a workshop - we\\'ll be hosting a three-day scratch workshop at mit this summer. for more information about the workshop and how to apply, check out http://cs4hs.media.mit.edu/ thanks again for attending the event last week. we look forward to seeing you on scratched! k\\n\\nkaren et al, thanks so much for a great event!\\n\\n', '48144': 'how do i untangle and begin to help this student????

feel easier identify bad stuff pair holy version worst things see projects beleive qualify leaving instructions floating script zone attaching scripts wrong sprite tell wrong sprite much harder tell right one isn undue nesting conditions thanks understand first third examples instances code less readable trying think example second need think meant programming habits something feel often missing habit documentation rosemary slattery also spoke last scratched meetup whether comments scripts description project notes feel like documentation project incredibly helpful therefore habit definetly comments make list habits shown recently comments function better though beginners worst problem glide block easy they get frustrated cant anything guide exactly true much better iterative movement name bad programming habits forgetting green flag initialization project without green flag initialization website cannot initialized unless page reloaded run change effect without attaching scenario expect remember setting dimitris lack comments scripts lack information user regarding errors occur tell user also fix forgetting initialize variables using variable names reflect contents using counting variables instance acceptable otherwise variable names realted program values carry students prefer use condition end condition end instead else structure using may acceptable initially students eventually transition else two problems sometimes students negate condition second statement write opposite condition incorrectly example replacement else case limbo may actions first conditonal may also trigger second conditional real life example mind right following illustrates idea end something else end easily see example conditionals become true recycling variables hold different types bad habit needs fixed move languages like python variable declarations needed making matters worse mean parts application variable holds say number later string assigned variable

socket connections close database connections etc dream think something else post thanks angel never required students grades use comment part becuase didn like displayed think students hard time explaining code beyond reading blocks age group work introduce comments also never thought instruct students use stop script block code naturally ends mostly lot students create never ends interesting thought though explain stops anyways explaining need block thought stop script break statement file close maybe misleading susan susan teach kids quite bit older using comments tool help students plan design scripts learn basics using think example someone learning woodworking first learn measure cut sand make joints select wood pieces etc basic level mastery move know make furniture cabinets etc however probably start making chair without least basic scketch chair going look like wood use dimensions way see two main kinds comments students get used one use explain something implemented idea communicate others future reference fragment code came sometimes complex nested conditional structure tricky repeat intricate broadcasting system bunch blocks trying achieve simple logical task program example drawing outline pine tree using move turn pen blocks context winter scene candidates documented something took lot trivial work achieve effort figure documented superfluous comments however avoided kind comments related planning program like actions cooking recipe whisk eggs sugar comment set steps needed complete task use oultine different high level actions sprite going comments also result brainstorming session students sprites order comments also help keeping track implemented yet done attach comments corresponding blocks first block implementing action described comments tempting start throwing blocks see experimenting learning new blocks however whenever building application students tutorial example think idea provide overall picture trying using comments describe high level actions application take assigning projects students first describe want achieve using comments check plans point things missing clear need different approach afraid topic like one come sooner later going indoctrinate kids adults considering practices term suggests unhealthy dose ideology whenever see project website truly amazes looking code bit downer usually full gargantuan run scripts global variables forever loops race conditions point project impressed much wanted look code first place cool precisely kids produce programmed content right away without first instructed avoid adhere sure often code plain ugly point doesn stand way create share initialize variables nothing breaks initially zero use green flag hat block fact often instead use say mouse click keyboard event trigger things initialize reset values okay leave hatted blocks incomplete stacks floating around scripting area use debug project double clicking quarry features want add later also perfectly okay nest conditions makes easier keep track reasoning instead using equally nested predicates stop script block raison etre terminate perpetual loop case stop condition met surely end script plain ends wrong using often times plain need else case kids produce stacks conditions instead deeply nested else ones make performance issues otoh rather read stack simple conditions cluttered mess nested ones variables need declared fact make variable restricted certain type store either number string byob even lists sprites blocks bad practice adult world exchange variable value differently typed one modern programming languages let written largely way awesome plus undoubtely works ugly projects talking rooted inability allow user defined procedures deficiency forces kids copy paste metaphor creating code hard edit later understand issue addressed team current rewrite let tell kids right wrong let asses programming languages many cannot cope child like practices easily handled let press languages become like jens understand point pretty much agree use practices show students improve projects cannot convince propose makes scripts better use nothing wrong teaching students organize tidy things also another goal mind students move non graphical language example indentation variable types matter want make aware things issues help transition nested agree jens comment rather read stack simple conditions cluttered mess nested ones readability trumps performance mind kids starting learn question ask better facilitates understanding talking habit like kids read code loud especially trying debug problem also ask explain tile times point draw explain happen particular block executes early career mentor tell think like computer later career someone suggest code loud try understand amazed much reading loud helped one slowed thinking forced focus line line instead imagining next large chunk code often wrong guessed especially since started guess wasn expected wrong mental model image going first simplest thing possible make work refactor kids motivated get someting want play game imitate mario bros etc question accomplished care get hard fun refactor define clean code improve readability reduce complexity increase maintainabilty quesiton suggestions welcomed accomplished goal point kids care thing one way try deal multiple kids working task one accomplishes elegant script the one kid show script rest class may also add specific words comments like script much better one wrote always try make fool opposed one kids plus comes naturally user defined procedures blocks amen needed also something akin siblings etoys sprites share common script variable values different useful avoid copy paste teaching bad habit see often talking kids talking

parameters sometimes called arguments mathematics resemble many ways function call try like example let say project fish aquarium wanted tell change color make broadcast messages fish turn green fish turn red fish turn blue etc different broadcast message color lots colors wanted fish become lot messages situation couldn anticipate color wanted fish trouble define new broadcast message fly problems away attach parameters broadcast message inventing syntax instance perhaps let say broadcast fish change color green broadcast fish change color blue even better broadcast fish change color variable favorite color need one broadcast message able create variations message using parameters simulate large degree variable hold new fish color making broadcast message say fish look new fish color much effect two step process ways harder follow code creating objects fly let say made project asked player many lightning bugs like see flying around randomly say number well made enough
