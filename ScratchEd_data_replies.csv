I'll post details about the workshop (or some variant) this week... Thanks, K"885	221	NECC 2009	8/16/09 20:31	"Sorry for the delay! Here's an outline of the workshop and some slides. As you can probably see from the outline, our intention was to situate ways of introducing Scratch in hands-on experiences. One challenge, of course, is that there's so much happening with learning Scratch that it's sometimes difficult to step back and reflect on what that experience might be like for one's own students."932	221	NECC 2009	8/25/09 11:10	than you very much ! i'll take a look carefully at your attachments and post my thoughts1098	253	Using Scratch in ELL Learning	10/23/09 18:45	"As a reading specialist collaborating with Jeff, I am interested in accelerating our English language learners' academic achievement. The class is made up of Level 1 and Level 2 (WIDA Access) adolescents, many of whom arrive in the States with little if any previous formal education. There is a lot of incidental learning, i.e., they are acquiring skills without realizing it, especially in algebra and math applications. We are cognizant that, as each student explores new skills (adding color, adding sound, etc.), he/she becomes an ""expert"" and we encourage the social interaction that naturally occurs. Language teachers take note: all four skills (listening, speaking, reading, writing) are very organically involved in each class session; the communication is authentic and therefore very powerful. We're about 6 weeks into it, and even the most ""disengaged"" adolescents (we are noticing) are plugging into the program, so to speak. They want to be part of the ""fun""!"1100	253	Using Scratch in ELL Learning	10/24/09 11:00	"More information on the pilot Jeff and I did last year (2008-2009) can be found here: http://www.ncela.gwu.edu/accellerate/edition/7/#article_54 This year (2009-2010), we have more students and are more ambitious in planning and assessment (and covering specific curriculum requirements). Stay tuned."1102	253	Using Scratch in ELL Learning	10/24/09 19:29	Thanks for sharing what's happening -- I enjoyed reading the article. A couple of questions: Do the students use the blocks translation feature? Is there a link to the projects the students have shared on the web? Thanks again!

We are using a lesson that Isaac and I made this past Summer (http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/jelkner/591204).  The goals of the lesson are to help develop a feel for how changes in x and y effect direction, and changes in the repeat value effect magnitude (distance).  For most students the lesson is working as planned. I encountered one student, however, who can not yet compare numbers, so the lesson was completely inappropriate for her.  I immediately when looking for a Scratch activity involving ""which number is bigger"", but I didn't find one.  Perhaps Galleries linked to math domains could be setup to help make these easier? 2.  I haven't used Galleries yet.  It wasn't until today that I started thinking about them, but I can imagine a lot of uses for them.  We could create a gallery for each class, or even each project.  Perhaps Galleries could be used to link project to specific curricula, by openning them up to the world and labelling them clearly.  I created one now to get started with our next class project: http://scratch.mit.edu/galleries/view/62163.  It will be interesting to see how it works."1120	253	Using Scratch in ELL Learning	10/27/09 10:06	"I really like the idea of connecting to true stories, and want to work that approach in to future workshops. I particularly love the Elevator Romance theme for the gallery!"1140	253	Using Scratch in ELL Learning	10/31/09 23:59	"Yes, having the students demonstrate their understanding of a story is powerful. The two main characters are stuck in an elevator for 19 hours. The students are able to ""de-construct"" the scene as depicted via the words in the story, but we are finding that they are, in fact, having difficulty inferring what the conversation may be between 2 strangers stuck on an elevator together (who later fall in love and get married!) Most of them have the characters saying, ""Hi, how are you?"" and the responses are mostly formulaic, ""I'm fine. How are you?"" It's a step that needs more discussion.... On the other hand, our expectations for the project are constantly being ""upped"" in that we think they should be able to do certain things (change backgrounds, have the characters move, ""talk"" --and then someone learns how to record their voices and vroom! the rest of the group wants to learn how to record their dialogs! Very exciting. I'm finding (via focus group) that some students prefer to use the""big"" computers rather than the laptops. Stay tuned."1146	253	Using Scratch in ELL Learning	11/1/09 9:46	"I'm finding (via focus group) that some students prefer to use the""big"" computers rather than the laptops. I find that so interesting. Most of the kids (and adults) I've worked with prefer the freedom of laptops. (Although having a plug-in/non-integrated mouse is very frequently requested.) I look forward to hearing more about why that's the case..."1341	253	Using Scratch in ELL Learning	1/16/10 14:02	"We've finished the second quarter and find that evaluation (in keeping with our jurisdiction's guidelines) is problematic. There is no question that learning is occurring among our 25 student-community. In fact, the fact that we see ourselves as a true learning community somewhat adds to the difficulty of grading students. We have rubrics to guide them (and us), but our rubrics always seem to fall short. Our students always seem to be able to surprise us with capabilities that we don't foresee. For example, in our most recent project, the students imported 30"" of music--a skill not covered in our rubric. In summary, though, we continue to struggle with grading--content and skills. We observe how some students are able to work fast, help others, show creativity, use correct grammar and mechanics, and get the work done on time. We also observe less skilled students getting the help from those others and learning to the best of their (language and technical) ability. We attempt to pair students with different first languages in order to have them use language for authentic (and more rewarding on many levels) purposes. As a learning communicty, the class deserves an A. I'm not sure how the individuals will fare...."1342	253	Using Scratch in ELL Learning	1/17/10 8:27	Thanks so much for sharing the update! we continue to struggle with grading--content and skills How much of the rubric is focused on language acquisition and how much on technical acquisition?

A few of the integrated Scratch projects we tried to do were mostly centered around Social Studies and storytelling. For example: - Create a project retelling part of a Greek myth, including historically accurate drawings and at least 2 narrations. - Create a project describing an event or artifact from the Leakey site. It must include at least 2 sprites. http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/wbtech/307482 - Create a projecting showing some aspect of Egyptian life, using historically accurate sprites. Another student created his own Scratch project as a commercial for an assignment in another class: http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/wbtech/582728 As another link between school and Scratch, I started a Scratch Club last week for grades 5-8 at one of my schools. We're going to be meeting once a week after school for a little more than an hour until mid-December. Since yesterday (our first meeting), I've seen two of the participants sharing Scratch with their friends during the day - exciting stuff!

Last year, just as school was ending I had a child come up against some--not obscene--but certainly rude comments about a posted project. His parents stepped in, deleted his wiki account, and nailed me with some highly critical accusations for putting their child at risk for negative comments. Realizing that helicopter parents exist, what are other educators doing? Currently I am posting only certain student projects in a school account, but that seems counter to the spirit of the wiki sharing...Just opening up the topic for discussion. As I type this I'm thinking I'll workaround by setting up accounts linked to the gmail numbers-appended workaround teachers originally used for Voicethread...Time consuming, but pretty ""safe.""

I'm Nancy- I've taught grades 1-4 in New Hampshire and now 2 years as tech integrator at the American School of Madrid. I have an after-school group 2x a week in Madrid and in the past we focused on Digital Media. I wanted to use Scratch, so 2nd semester last year this group solely used Scratch. I had 8-12 grade 2-4 students (boys and girls) on Mondays and Wednesdays after school for an hour (some came 1 day a week, some both days each week.) There were a few who came to the lab where we met a few minutes before the official end of the school day they were so eager to get going! It was an amazing experience- collaboration, creativity, fun. I mostly watched and asked about what they were doing after I facilitated the start up. I did post some projects. Most students downloaded the program to use at home and set up their own accounts. Next year, I will hold after school groups 4 days a week- 2 days for grade 1/2 and 2 days for grades 3/4. I plan to intro other tools, programs, projects but also have Scratch available. What I want from the 2 workshops is guided training on how to use the program, ideas for how to use in the classroom and connect with others who may want to collaborate. I'm very much looking forward to it!  -Nancy"858	298	"Building Learning Communities | July 27, 2009"	7/24/09 18:30	"I work with grades 1st, 2nd, and 3rd at an all boy school in Memphis, TN. I help integrate technology into the classroom every day. I also work with teachers to give them ideas and lessons to use with their students. I used Scratch with 3rd graders this past year as an introduction to it for me and the students.  They loved it, the teacher loved it, and I loved it. I am interested in how to integrate more into the curriculum and classroom throughout the year.  I am also looking forward to learn more about it other than what I have taught myself through using it with the 3rd graders."859	298	"Building Learning Communities | July 27, 2009"	7/24/09 22:46	"My name is Jennifer Garcia. I am a Canadian teacher who has been working in El Salvador for the last 13 years. I currently teach ICT as well as run the new Learning Resources Centre. This past year our staff and students have taken to digital projects in a big way and we hope to continue expanding our digital toolboxes. I first became interested in Scratch about a year ago when I received information about it in an email. Unfortunately, I never got much further than downloading the software. This coming school year we are hoping to make Scratch a part of our ICT curriculum in at least one grade from 6th to 8th, and later bring it into other grades in the school. I really look forward to learning how to use Scratch myself as well as gain a better idea of how to use it with students to enhance their learning.

From this point, some students are going to rocket off on their own and start self-directed learning, trying out new blocks and jazzing up this lesson.  For others, it at least makes it seem easy to do, and they are willing to do some more tutorials to get some projects done. I like doing a step-by-step tutorial like this at the beginning because it allows all students to have a feeling of success, and this gets their interest peaked.  Although, at our advanced users Scratch summer camp, the kids really breezed right through this and were eager to move on to something more challenging. The projects that are included in Scratch are great examples, too."880	318	How do you introduce Scratch to beginners?	8/12/09 22:19	"My museum uses Scratch both in our museum for summer classes and workshops and in local libraries. Because we're sometimes working in drop-in settings where we might have a youth come in and spend time anywhere from 5  to 60 minutes,  We've started to introduce Scratch in a whole new way: We have computers set up with Scratch running, and invite youth to come and try the a 'new' program called Scratch. We have Scratch projected on a screen and withing a minute or two we'll show them how to do a couple things: click on the word 'file' in the menu, then go down to 'open' then show them the 'examples' button over on the leftr side of the window that pops up. Normally once we get this far they're off exploring - and ignoring us ( until they have a question). We'll show how to open the folders to the youth who're interested and then call out to everyone how if you click once on a project name in the folder list, you get a preview. Finally once they have the program open we try to get their attention ( we see them ignoring us as they mess about with Scratch as a very good thing) and show them that that green flag button will often get the program started. Sometimes the room suddenly becomes noisy with sound, and sometimes not - if not we'll prompt them that some of the projects make sound or music ( and sometimes this is where we need to help get sound working ( if available)) This usually ends up being 15-30 minutes. Whats been very suprising ( and a bit unerving even) is that we're finding we do not have to tour the youth through the program buttons and menus - and in fact when we've stuck to a tour of Scratch ( beyond file/open/green flag) they're often not listening and moving ahead on their own. We've been calling this our 'just in time' introduction. What can follow is dropping a scratch card next to computers, or simply getting everyones attention once they've begun, and showing them how to draw a sprite ( and thats the next discussion)"891	318	How do you introduce Scratch to beginners?	8/22/09 13:30	"I've been teaching Scratch for about 2 or 3 years, whenever I first found out about it. I download the Scratch video and the kids love watching that, about how they can do these projects too just by ""messing around."" Then I introduce the blocks, noting color and what they each do. After that, I take out one of the cards from the Scratch site, an easy one like maybe the ghost gliding, and then they are hooked. But, I don't let them go free yet... no, I make them do enough until it's 5 min. till end of class. Then they play. Then next time, I finish the cards and give them little assignments. Before you know it, they have taken off in 10 directions. I find if they don't have enough knowledge before they are set free that they just pile the sprites onto one another. But, if they know how to make them move then it goes much better!"1132	318	How do you introduce Scratch to beginners?	10/29/09 13:30	"I typically work with kids from 6 yrs up to 10 yrs who have no Scratch/programing experience at all in small groups (6-12 at a time). We have been using Pico Blocks but I keep a laptop on the side of our classroom with various Scratch applications I've coded. The first thing I do is ask who has used a computer before and similar questions, the point being to take them from feeling unfamiliar with the whole thing straight to ""Oh, yeah I guess I have more experience than I thought."" Then I explain how a computer only does what you tell it to. I briefly imitate a robot and get them to ""program"" me by giving me audible commands. I set a goal of making me get across the room and pick up an object. I have a lot of fun with i and they do to. For example, they figure out to tell me ""Start walking"" pretty quickly but become highly amused when I walk straight ahead into the wall. This segues into a brief run down of some of the things you can do with the system. Then I give everyone their Lego sets and let them spend some time doing nothing but working with the pieces. Next, we pick our first project and off we go! With this age group and time constraints running from 5 days of 4 hour classes or even one day of 3 hours, I have to do a lot of pre-planning and maintain a flexible lesson plan. I am also teaching at a museum so 1)they are paying to be there 2) we want them to come back 3) they don't have to come back! So I make sure that they know about my basic rules from day one... If we're not having fun, we are doing something wrong. There are no wrong answers in my classroom because you can learn from anything. We share materials and help each other. That's pretty much it. I also do not stand for ""telling on each other."" In my small environment, I am aware of everything that goes on. Most of the time when a student complains about another student, they were sharing in the alleged ""trouble"" up until they decided to get the other one in trouble. My students readily accept this as I explain everything in a way that they can understand and relate to instead of as a ""way it is"" rule. I get their sympathy with this by asking them ""What happens we we have to stop having fun so I can handle problems?"" ""Do we want to lose the little time we have to play over silly stuff?"" Basically, I use empathy as often as I can. It is not about you, me, or them, it is about us. Of course no plan is perfect so even if I have to address a student one on one, I make sure that they feel as though we are 2 people talking instead of me coming across like the light-flickering school teacher demanding/begging for their attention. I am very fortunate to be working in such a wonderful setting. I am allowed to step outside the normal teaching boundaries imposed in the Public School System and I get excellent results. My students often do not want to take their break time. At the end of the day, I have to make them go home. They beg to know about more classes, where to purchase the supplies we use, and they show up for the next set of classes. It probably helps that I am a born performer so I have an intuitive knack for reading people and situations. I also pride myself on thinking outside the box. Our town is rather small and sometimes can feel bleak. We are extremely lucky just to have the facilities we use. So I repeatedly resort to my own proven methodology... immediately knock them sideways with something they aren't expecting, now you've got their attention and better yet their interest, now con them into thinking that this is all just a big fun playtime. Once they go into ""We're having fun mode"" I can cram an unbelievable amount of knowledge in at every opportunity cause know we're not learning, we're playing. I was a gifted student who was failed by the school system. I also come from a long line of educators. I see instructors time and time again who seem to act like they themselves were programmed (somewhat poorly) by someone using Scratch. And my heart goes out to all the teachers who have been constrained by administrators and do gooders who understand bottom lines far better than a random child standing in front of them. I do it because I love it and there is nothing more infectious than that. I guess i hindsight, maybe school didn't fail me after all. From conflict comes action!"1133	318	How do you introduce Scratch to beginners?	10/29/09 15:11	"Thanks for sharing what you do.

I think there has been a huge shift in the way that kids learn. Older generations were as a rule more prone to be wary of hitting the 'wrong' button. Newer generations already know concepts so instead of not hitting the buttons, they punch away. This is because they are familiar with and expecting/looking for concepts... Save, Delete, Enter, Reset, etc. Personally I suspect that this gives them somewhat of a leg up on various learning curves."860	319	Scratch 1.4 Available	7/26/09 11:54	thanks is it possible to upgrade from the previous version or it should be installed anew ?861	319	Scratch 1.4 Available	7/26/09 11:55	"As far as I know, you need to install the next version.

Having taught 6th grade math for many years, the coputational component was the least creative part of teaching math - and I didn't really enjoy it. I understand that in this context, computational thinking is a more open ended creative way of working through a problem. It is a way of puting something in a process and getting something else out and thinking through the steps of getting the idea from one place to another.

A Unique question ?! I will try to answer based on my 25 years with various programming languages and make the following points : 1) Trying to anticipate what the software user  may do and designing the proper response and then learning from trial and error what should be done to make your software - Almost Perfect - is a very  useful process that teaches the young ones many planning lessons. 2) The value of sticking to good variable names and nice structures in the long run, rather than the instant gratification of quick-and-dirty programming can be demonstrated with ease. 3) The balance between what I call nice/elegant/structured coding and fast accurate answers is usually a very quick lesson in being practical. and much more.."1443	338	What is computational thinking?	2/27/10 0:28	Karen what an interesting question you have brought up.  I was not at the talk so my response lacks the contextual framework in which your quotation was used.  All the same I am fascinated by the term computational.  On the one hand it refers to computation.  That is something that has been going on for thousands of years.  On the other hand the word computer is infused in that adjective today.  I don't think you can talk about computational thinking without thinking about the flood of data that exists in the world today.  I really like how Tim Berners-Lee talks about it on TED. www.ted.com/talks/tim_berners_lee_on_the_next_web.html Ultimately it is up to computers and people thinking computationally to handle this new world order.  What better argument can you make to start children learning computer programming at an early age?2847	338	What is computational thinking?	1/10/12 21:26	"The ability to construct outcomes that are logical, sequential, and concise."792	344	Art and Technology	7/16/09 16:17	"Technology is another medium to creatively communicate information, beauty, and emotions through Art.

In schools, It can act as an equalizer for those students who don't always shine in the classroom."794	344	Art and Technology	7/16/09 21:24	"Technology and art were not traditionally thought of as complementary. When I thought art, I immediately think of paint and museums. When I thought technology, I think of software/hardware/productivity and then gaming, internet and interactive programs. David's projects pointed me in a totally different way. The Nobel Fields was an artist wonder. The technology was the art form that made the historical information pleasurable and intriguing. I was inspired by the Word Well and the Holocaust Museum's interactive participation. I do not consider myself traditionally artistic with paint, although I love to color. I feel that technology medium can level the playing field and make us all ""artists"" in the true sense of the word."795	344	Art and Technology	7/16/09 21:46	"Since I'm not really an artist (although I can be creative), technology helps me create works of art. It gives me tools to do things I never imagined.  It empowers me the artist in me. I can be more creative and am able to think about creating in new ways. I can combine media and end up with a product I never imagined. Technology helps express my ideas and thoughts. If I look at art as a starting point and consider how it inspires me to think about technology, I realize that I can interact with works of art -- reinterpret them using technology; I can examine them at a pixel level -- understand technique and mastery; I can explore mathematical relationships -- examine perspective and proportions, etc.; I can use art as a focal point for exploring technology and its tools. If I think about it long enough it seems impossible to separate the two ... like an Escher drawing ... the art inspires technology and the technology inspires art. (The pen draws the hand which draws the pen which draws the ..... )"800	344	Art and Technology	7/17/09 16:26	"I am facinated by the connections between mathematical ideas and art. I think technology helps us to see those connections. It is also inspiring to see how technology can be beautiful and the ways that art can inspire technological form and function. To really answer this question I would need to define art and define technology. If technology is any tool, then the creation of any art requires some kind of technology like a pencil or a paintbrush. If I define art as a product of human creativity then everything we have done with Scratch is art - as it has requred a fair amount of creativity on my part to create my projects."803	344	Art and Technology	7/17/09 16:33	"Technology has always been part of the art making process! jiove.com/PROCESS/phase2/lascaux_horse.jpg The Lascaux cave painter, whoever he or she was, had to figure out how to make his/her media (mineral-based pigments, carving tools, etc) using whatever materials were available 16,000 years ago. These were state of the art technology at the time. Plaster, marble, bronze, oil paint, photography, motion pictures, and plastics were all ""new media"" once. Now that there are expensive museums full of artworks made with these media, it's easy for us to think of them as more ""real"" or ""serious"" than other kinds of work. I still love working by hand, and I think traditional drawing is a valuable skill to teach students. There are a million ways to combine the traditional and digital arts - for example, you can sketch a pencil drawing, scan it and clean it up in Photoshop, print it out and retrace it in ink, scan it again and color it in Photoshop, then print it out to a high-quality color printer. Or whatever you like. I'm interested in helping students break down the arbitrary division between the physical art object and the digital image."835	344	Art and Technology	7/18/09 7:40	"""If technology is any tool, then the creation of any art requires some kind of technology like a pencil or a paintbrush."" from Liz Davis I never thought of art using technology in this way, but this is a great example. Many people think that technology is just about computers (at least my students think that), but you are right that the tools used in art are technology. Scratch can integrate art into the techology class and  I think it can help students who might not think they are good at art have a medium that they can be successful with."836	344	Art and Technology	7/18/09 8:12	"Art is generally part of the physical world and its creation involves interacting with or acting on that world, but what makes a particular act  or product art and another not? As technologies expand, the possibilities for art expand. Hopefully, visual design is an important part of engineering and constructing using the technologies at hand (of everything that we create and live with). I agree that there is value and satisfaction in ""traditional"" methods like drawing, but it is great to also see innovation.  As a librarian, I really like the feel of a book, the binding, end-papers, fonts, even the smell-all those tactile qualities.  But I see the value in the playaway and the Kindle, and there value to me would increase if they somehow spoke more to my senses like a book. I see in the media labs we visited, the focus on trying to make the technologies work with the ""human"", sense elements to make the products more appealing.  Bravo."840	344	Art and Technology	7/18/09 9:07	I believe that technology does allow access to the discovery of artistic interest and the stimulation of artistic ability. Could Paint or Photoshop late at night in the privacy of your own room be enough to generate the next Picasso or Spielberg?797	348	How do you explain parallelism and events?	7/17/09 16:23	"I loved the display of paralell events in scratch. I was not aware that we could have scripts running together but not connected, so to speak. That was very helpful to design or create the scripts ""next"" to each other and have them occur simaltaneously or soon after an event! So parallelism is when things are happening at the same time and events are things that are going to be happening."798	348	How do you explain parallelism and events?	7/17/09 16:26	"Parallelism is when actions occur at the same time. When scripts in scratch are executed at the same time. You can run parallel actions in scratch by using the same ""hat command"" to begin each script. Events are actions that occur in a sequence, one after another. One event can lead to another event. In scratch to use events you can use one script that continues with multiple commands. You can also use the broadcast command to control the events."806	348	How do you explain parallelism and events?	7/17/09 16:40	"Parallelism are events that can happen at the same time, either independently or inter-dependently.  In Scratch, each sprite can respond differently to a common event (broadcast).  They can also send messages (boadcasts) to each other to trigger new events. This can be used to control timing/coordination between sprites.  This is better than using delays (wait) which are static and are difficult to maintain when making changes to the project...."808	348	How do you explain parallelism and events?	7/17/09 16:44	"Parallelism is things occuring at the same time. Your demonstration having one person being the programmer and then having other people being the sprites was very illustrative to me. I plan to use this with my students to show them how the scripts work. I love that you enlarged the commands and had them taped to the board. I was not aware that you could put scripts beside each to run parallel. The broadcast command is awesome. Your demonstration also clearly illustrated events - which can be defined as actions, something happening. When designing scratch projects this concept is key to building projects that perform in the manner that you want."811	348	How do you explain parallelism and events?	7/17/09 16:52	"Events are happenings or scripts that are going to happen. Parallelisms are events that occur at the same time, independently or in conjunction. The modeling of these concepts this morning was great. I am such a visual learning and the large scale model help it all to make sense. Please post those blocks as a downloadable resource. I can see using these in groups within the classroom/lab setting. I want to be able to print them on cardstock to laminate and print them on magnetics to use on a whiteboard."818	348	How do you explain parallelism and events?	7/17/09 17:01	"Parallelism is ""stuff"" happening at the same time.  Using Scratch in a computer science course for a cross curriculum based project is an example of parallelism in the classroom. Today's example of demonstrating parallelism in programming with Scratch was a great tool for my ""teacher tool box"".  THANK YOU!"822	348	How do you explain parallelism and events?	7/17/09 22:14	"In today's lesson you explained parallelism to us as ""stuff happening at the same time"", and events as ""letting things know that something is going to happen"". I thought the lesson was brilliant--the human sprites and the taping of code to the white board slowed everything down and made important concepts really clear.  Stepping through and showing mistakes that one might make was also important. The timing of the lesson was also perfect for my needs--I had struggled with parallelism the evening before as I was working on some projects."827	348	How do you explain parallelism and events?	7/17/09 22:40	"Parallelism is some ""thing"" happening at the same time.  Each coded script allows for this to occur using the applicable code fragments. These coded scripts can be grouped as stacks which allow the script's execution to be faster. The event is letting the ""thing"" know that something is going to happen. The broadcast code allows all sprites to hear the message. Then the command ""when I receive"" can be used to allow another happening. This is a very exciting approach to coding.  I can envision my computer science newbies beginning their year with Scratch.  This code sets the stage for the logical thinking process needed to tackle other programming languages."842	348	How do you explain parallelism and events?	7/18/09 9:30	Parallelism is a concept that has rocked me to my programming core. Having coded in COBOL and event driven programming languages and being a very strong mono-tasker by nature I like controlling ONE THING at a time. My world is now filled with complication.843	348	How do you explain parallelism and events?	7/18/09 9:31	"An event is an occurrence which can be used to trigger the start of a stack of blocks.  An event can be a generated by a Broadcast, but it can also be generated by user input such as pressing a key or clicking the mouse."802	349	What is a story?	7/17/09 16:31	I really enjoyed the story telling with Scratch. It was fun and funny. So far the work I have done with students has all been games and I have worked with math teachers to create them. I can now see ways to incorporate Scratch into a language arts classroom. I especially enjoyed the way we switched computers to continue the story. I think that would be a great project to do next year. All of my 8th graders have used Scratch. Now I can go into a 9th grade English class and use it to tell a story. I think that would be a great way to show kids the connections between disciplines.804	349	What is a story?	7/17/09 16:37	"So...a story is a group of words that has a beginning (introduction of the topic), a middle( development of the plot) and an end( some sort of conclusion or . (WOW!, that was so simplistic) Story starters get the reader hooked on continuing on and the middle of the story is the develpoment of the idea and the end just brings closure,  in some way to the events. I was very interested in learning to create stories in scratch. I love the idea of combining a curricular goal with a computational goal or learning experiment. Having said that, I am a bit stuck on how to keep the focus on writing and yet let them explore and have fun creating an animated story that is captivating to the reader. So, does scratch expand or limit the goal of storytelling.....HMMMMM? I think in some ways it is limiting because you spend so much time trying to get the characters to do what you want them to do, the content is lost. BUT, I also can see that stories can be brought to life and developed by being able to animate and be very creative about the story telling. Ideas from the story may come from the programming of the characters themselves. I need to think about how to use scratch for storytelling. I love the idea but I am unclear about how to proceed."809	349	What is a story?	7/17/09 16:44	"Telling stories using scratch is a way to get non technical students interested in using technology to tell their story in a different way. It is a medium that is not that difficult to learn, and lends itself to a lot of creativity, allowing students to express themselves besides writing..."810	349	What is a story?	7/17/09 16:45	"I also enjoyed the story telling with Scratch. Unfortunately, I haven't been able to support our writing curriculum due to the fact that I see students once a week for 50 minutes blocks. It would be time comsuming to take a writing assigment from start to completion in the process that is utilizing in the classroom. I envision Scratch as an avenue to champion writing in a different format. This is great for modification and differentiation. As a side benefit, I do not feel that the students will think that it is a long and drawn out process to go from start to completion within the Scratch format, even if it takes them a month."812	349	What is a story?	7/17/09 16:55	I think Scratch can expand what it means to tell a story for many people. The graphics and animations can help people express ideas in another way. People who struggle with writing can be very creative with telling stories using Scratch. It  could even help them devolop their strories that they write.814	349	What is a story?	7/17/09 16:57	Three famous story beginnings: Once upon a time….1300’s It was the best of times It was the worst of times…… Charles Dickens It was a dark and stormy night… Edward B. Litton Stephanie Gayle asked us two important questions. What does my character want?  What stands in my character's way? Great idea to help students to tell a story.  Scratch can be used to tell a story using parallel stacks. Wonderful information we can use in our classrooms.815	349	What is a story?	7/17/09 16:58	"Are you looking for a fun new way to tell a story through technology?  We found out today that Scratch is the creative answer to illustrate, interact, and add dialog and  sounds :)."816	349	What is a story?	7/17/09 16:58	"I was especially interested in using scratch to tell stories. At my school we have many projects that we ask the students to create stories based on content knowledge they have learned through their research. We teach them research skills and how to present their information as a research paper. Then they are asked to teach their classmates about their their topic in the form of a story, the story is to both inform and entertain. This involves loads of creativity and they must script it out before sitting down at the computer - this project can easily be adapted to Scratch. We currently use PhotoStory and it works very well. But, now that I know (sort of) how to use scratch, I plan on having them use scratch for their second storytelling project. Their final projects are shared with the entire class and then posted on our moodle site for others to see. By posting the the scratch website, their audience will be so much larger! Scratch is more powerful than PhotoStory!"821	349	What is a story?	7/17/09 18:45	"I loved the application of Scratch into the storytelling process! I have to admit that I am not the most creative person so searching through the backgrounds and sprites really helped me come up with ideas for my story.  I think this would really help students who also struggle when asked to think up an original story .  The collaborative story undertaking was my favorite part of the conference so far.  I loved seeing how my story developed and this process again would help anyone who has a hard time thinking of a story idea, since the beginning or middle of the story has already been created .  I think students would feel the same excitement that we did when viewing what our colleagues had done with our stories and I definitely plan on trying out this project with students during the upcoming school year."823	349	What is a story?	7/18/09 0:42	On a rain free night in a MIT dorm room a tired Creative Computing participant reflected on her day......... Students won't even realize they are writing when they are creating  in Scratch.  Scratch allows for even the most uncreative people to get creative.   Using the collaborative story telling Scratch programming activity will be great fun in high school.  The high level of engagement will be wonderful;  I can only imagine what kind of funny stories that will be written  through this creative outlet.826	349	What is a story?	7/17/09 22:34	"After reading the comments of 10 fellow participants, my head is spinning with ideas about how I might approach Stories and Scratch in my classroom.  Like Vickie, I am thinking about adapting some projects that I had previously approached with Photostory.  In particular, I am thinking about using archival photos as backgrounds and asking the students to bring the photos to life with Scratch.  I think this will develop their visual awareness, and allow them to demonstrate historical knowledge they have gained through research."831	349	What is a story?	7/18/09 7:00	"I agree that using Scratch to create ""a product"" that synthesizes and incorporates information gathered during the research process would be a great library activity.  To overcome time constraints, it could be a shared project between language arts, computer, (all the disciplines-for that matter), and library. Telling a ""Scratch story"" about content information will enable students to really learn deeply, and to share in each other's learning, and to have fun!"832	349	What is a story?	7/18/09 7:05	"Family stories and local history projects seem like a natural for this format.  Students can bring in their digitgal pictures (if they don't have cameras, maybe send a less expensive camera home taking turns by the week, like the kindergarteners sometimes get to take a special toy home) and create narratives to go along with the pictures.  They could do ""me projects"" with time sequences or a type of ""family tree""."833	349	What is a story?	7/18/09 7:16	"When Stephanie Gayle introduced the topic of ""beginnings"", I thought of the recent Newberry winning book by Neil Gaiman, The Graveyard Book, and its cast of unusual characters: There was a hand in the darkness, and it held a knife. I could see using Scratch to explore the elements of a story-maybe a type of alternative book report."834	349	What is a story?	7/18/09 7:25	"Finally (I like lotteries, too!) I agree that the variety of the sprites and their expressions, the backgrounds and the whole process encourage a more free flowing, fun process of story unfolding. I guess using a story board to preplan each step would be another approach, and I am sure a lot of preplanning goes into smany of the projects (in the gallery), but it was fun to interact with the given characters and the pieces that the other group members had added. It provided a more spontaneous way of engaging."837	349	What is a story?	7/18/09 8:18	"I loved storytelling with Scratch in our workshop. I especially liked the way the story changed -- partly because of the author switches, but also because Scratch (the technology) drove the creativity which was driving the technology ... an infinite loop ... and therefore storytelling becomes a way to look at art/technology and brings us back to the question Mitch asked earlier this week ... sneaky!"863	349	What is a story?	7/26/09 12:37	"it'd be interesting to use a story-telling approach also in math; if you're aware of that, in Scratch world or else, please tell me"868	349	What is a story?	7/26/09 13:22	I searched Google Scholar for storytelling and mathematics and a few interesting articles were returned.

Karen R."881	401	math & physics resources	8/15/09 12:52	I'm interested in using Scratch to teach elementary math concepts in my classroom. I'll be exploring that this coming year.890	401	math & physics resources	8/21/09 19:15	"Dear all, My goal in Scratch and before that for the last 20 years has been to develop real and virtual games and activities to teach and expose basic math and science (mostly math) to students in K-8 We have started a Team called The Super School Team with ffred, dapontes and mathjp The Numbers Gallery is one of the first Programs. I have also been working with Karen's class. I have grouped some of my work (almost all for teaching elemetry math) into the following galleries I am all for coming up with ways to make these and all math and science projects in Scratch more accessiable to teachers. Graphing Calculator Series (mostly done for Karen's class then I added other projects that I found) http://scratch.mit.edu/galleries/view/34684 K-2 http://scratch.mit.edu/galleries/view/39051 3-5 http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/DrSuper/471789 6-8 http://scratch.mit.edu/galleries/view/38250 Quick Math http://scratch.mit.edu/galleries/view/30594 QuicK Science http://scratch.mit.edu/galleries/view/30723 Puzzles http://scratch.mit.edu/galleries/view/33210 Dr. Supers Math and Science Games and Activities http://scratch.mit.edu/galleries/view/23437 I have gone through most of the 600+ projects in Math Projects Gallery http://scratch.mit.edu/galleries/view/6423 We need a few criteria to classify these and identify the ones that can be used in the classroom."896	401	math & physics resources	8/23/09 16:53	"For Teachers to find projects in scratch that they can use in their class rooms we need to identify the content and the quality of the project for classroom use. We need to have a roup that is charged with this task and we can start with the Gallery Math Projects that contains most of the math related projects for Content we need a Hierarchy: Grade (K-2, 3-5, 6-8, 9-12) Strand (Number Sense, Measurement, Geometric Sense, Probability and Statistics, Algebraic Sense) Topic Subtopic For Quality we can use an A, B, C, D, F scale to determine the qulity and classroom usability of the project. Karen Can this be added to ScratchED or is it somehow in ScratchED already?"914	401	math & physics resources	8/23/09 6:51	This is a bug how can we remove these I save once and I got several copies917	401	math & physics resources	8/23/09 7:35	"I've deleted the extra copies. I haven't seen that behavior. Did you click ""save"" only once and wait for it to reload? What browser were you using?"924	401	math & physics resources	8/23/09 16:48	Yes I only pressed enter and this happened (I think) I did not save that many times for sure. IE 7 in PC (Vista)925	401	math & physics resources	8/23/09 16:54	It's definitely strange behavior! I'll keep an eye on it -- thanks for the usage information.926	401	math & physics resources	8/23/09 17:05	"You can add Scratch projects (or links to projects and galleries) as resources on ScratchEd. Resources can be described by the site taxonomy (age, content type, curricular area) or folksonomy (community-supplied keywords). Between the two of these you should be able to describe the grade and strand. As for quality indicators, the idea of resource rating systems was brought up in another thread. For now, comments (and the resource description itself) can be used to describe the quality and usability of the project. For example, I added a resource about stories. It's a collection of projects that I think are great examples of using Scratch for storytelling. Hope that helps, Karen"927	401	math & physics resources	8/23/09 21:54	"I know in theory that the current labels should allow us to make a hierarchy, but it feels complicated and hard to organize.  I agree with Behrouz about having topics and subtopics in a list that an educator can easily navigate when browsing.  It is the same sort of wish that I have for project galleries.  It would be lovely to be able to organize them with nesting folders or links inside links."928	401	math & physics resources	8/23/09 21:58	"OK, I see how you did the story project grouping.  Imagine, though, that someone else wants to add to the collection.  Then later on the collection gets organized by projects that build from one concept to the next.  Then someone wants to insert a project into the middle of the collection because it fits better there.  Is that possible in the current set-up? Karen R."929	401	math & physics resources	8/24/09 8:01	"Oh, I think I understand what you're trying to do. ScratchEd was designed to be flexible across lots of different types of resources, which makes it hard to have that sort of hierarchical specificity. Two ideas come to mind. I guess you could either: (1) be flexible about the way you imagine the collection being presented (e.g. across resources instead of building one resource up) and use ScratchEd, or (2) use another tool to construct your collection (e.g. like a wiki to generate a taxonomy with as much nesting as you like) and then point to it from ScratchEd. What do you think? Do you have other ideas? It's a great project -- let me know how I can help!"934	401	math & physics resources	8/25/09 12:14	"yes, Karen, i share your view; moreover, i'd like to place our discussion in the mind of a teacher working in whatever school in the world (isn't that Scratch is intended to ?) and let's ask ourselves: what does this man/woman need to let Scratch land in his/her classroom ? 1. he/she should be sufficiently experienced with the language (a lot has already been written ) 2. after that the question is: well, i have to teach this topic to these kids of this age in this country, is there anything out there to help me ? the teacher may be really busy so he/she goes quickly through web resources, looking for what is in order; if this is the goal a web resource for Scratch should satisfy, a good starting point could be the structure of the geogebra wiki page, which i use a lot (i'm very sorry, i do not know how to add the hyperlink here): http://www.geogebra.org/en/wiki/index.php/English#Mathematics:_High_School topics are neatly organized, a teacher may go and search easily, people around the world may contribute and so on ... as you already know; take a look and share your view thank you again for the work you're doing"936	401	math & physics resources	8/28/09 7:48	"I would have hoped that the Wiki would stay in ScratchEd and be managed by a editor group we already have a few candidates for this group. They will decide who gets to insert what where. Search and being able to limit it with the Tags that I mentioned would have been so much easier. Even if we had a search that would keep limiting the set of projects that would help. So a teacher like Karen could search for 6-8 then for Geometry then Coordinates. I suggest for now just to test the water: 1.  We divide up the Projects in the Math Gallery and Give them a Quality ranking like Quality A, Quality B for those that can be used in the classroom (there maybe 100+ of these) . 2. Then assign Grade Strand, Topics and Subtopics to these."951	401	math & physics resources	9/3/09 22:42	"Here is another thought about how to approach this project.  Most math curriculum design these days starts from a set of standards, in particular the National Council for Teachers of Mathematics.  This is the link to their tables of standards for grades 6-8, for example.  http://standards.nctm.org/document/chapter6/alg.htm How about choosing a level like this, putting the table in a wiki, then adding a column to the table that has Scratch project demonstrations, project assignments, or projects that use the concept?  Teachers could check the standard they need to teach and see what sorts of projects address it.  Problems with this--there are a lot of standards, the language of standards can be dense, projects fit more than one standard ... Karen R."969	401	math & physics resources	9/10/09 14:05	"Hi Karen (R.), thank you for the link you highlighted ! I think it fits almost perfectly what i had in mind. More exactely, my proposal may be told as follows: pretend to be a math teacher in grade 7 (or whatever else), preparing one (or more than one) algebra class consider choose one (or more than one) item of the left column for ""Expectations"" standards each of these elements (expanded or not into their more detailed right column version) should report links to Scratch projects that the committee (let's call it this way, freely change it if you disagree) has identified as fitting enough to that expectation finally, the teacher downloads and that's done ! IMHO, we can also add a cumulative reviewing system such that who downloads a particulat project may also increase (in his/her view) or decrease the degree of fitness of that project into that expectation; this system should be carefully moderated by the committee, to prevent a mess of confusing scoring. Anyway it may be useful to get a realtime feedback by educators using scratch for math and related subjects. Your opinions are welcome. Thank you for your attention. PS: It would be a plus to add also a scoring system reserved for young users, as they are a very active partner of Scratch development."975	401	math & physics resources	9/12/09 13:42	"Karen (R.), Roberto et al, I think the following link provides a good start for Strand ,Topic and Subtopic and this may be what we start with rather than the more details of the link that you shared from NCTM. These are basically th same but now have Topic and Subtopic also.  I have started extracting these and I will share but we need to see how we can divide the work of tagging projects with these. Karen (B.) can ScratchEd built something special for this purpose I hope we can discuss this in the workshop you may wish to run it by the team there. http://www.linkslearning.org/Teachers/1_Math/2_Curriculum_Planning/3_K-8_Math_Content/index.html"977	401	math & physics resources	9/13/09 15:47	"I’ve a different point of view about the way Scratch can help the kids in the studying of school matters: it stimulates the pupil to make his own research about the subjects that he can work out with the Scratch. Then, first they need to learn how the Scratch works, in developing very much easy projects with a lot of handmade draws or NET imported ones. Afterwards, they need to see some, (only a few) projects well classified, (this is what your question is about), and I recommend to visit all the galleries of “DrSuper”, “Goch” and “Paddle2See”, to mention only three Scratchers that have collected properly some projects of the whole Scratch world.. Then, they must takeoff to their own fly, scratching the school matters with the support of their teachers and, in second line, the help of seniors Scratchers."978	401	math & physics resources	9/13/09 15:58	"Hi Roberto, I’m afraid I must to give you back your question: tell me one concrete subject that   you would like to see transformed in a Scratch project to use in classroom and I’ll give you the project   by measure with all the aspects and changes that you consider as improvements. In conclusion: I think that you can require from a tailor a handmade suite that fits you instead of entering in a supermarket to search among the shelfs a suit that is the nearest of your needs."993	401	math & physics resources	9/17/09 11:08	"Thanks for your comments, Fernando. My proposal is intended to teachers who have strict curriculum demands (e.g. from the Ministry of Education) and cannot spend as much time as they like to activities other than curriculum teaching. Every tool helping in doing this job is welcome. Your approach is good and i have been using it in my CS activities in after school centers since years ago, where curriculum demands are less compelling and the teacher/educator can decide what to do/not to do on his/her own. My 2 cents."1021	401	math & physics resources	9/30/09 3:46	"Hello, let me get into this discussion. A teacher of an afternoon course (7th & 8th grade) gave me some tasks she made for their students. She's very interested in using Scratch in combination with math and physics. I'll give you the first task: The capital is ""Programming with Scratch - Illustration and Calculation of Fields"" 1. Draw a (thin) line (AB) from point (A, coordinates specification) (horizontal) with a lenght of (5cm) - THIN is variable, it can also be THICK or DASHED - horizontal is variable, it can also be vertical or angle of 45 degrees That's only one task. Later on they have to do calculations on cuboids, prisms and other geometrical problems. The goal should be (teachers opinion) to teach the kids in easy programming AND math. The problem I figured out is that you can only demonstrate or visualize the problem in Scratch. I think it's hard to teach programming in Scratch AND boring tasks like the one I mentioned above. Either the kids learn to program OR learn and understand why they use appropriate formulas for geometric calculations. In the Scratch forums and gallaries are a lot of interesting visualizations of math problems. But do they explain the formulas working in the background? Isn't that what's important for math and physics? What do you think? Any suggestions to combine programming in Scartch and learning math? Thanks in advance Thilo P.S.: I think you can teach tasks like that in afternoon courses only, because teachers have strict curriculum demands (like roberto said)."1025	401	math & physics resources	9/30/09 7:33	"I am co-teaching a Physics + Programming + Math unClass this Fall. We had three two-hour weekly meetings so far. We have twelve homeschool kids, ages ten to sixteen, with varying levels of physics, math and programming backgrounds. Here are our tasks: Week 1 Physics: The scientific method. How many water drops fit on a penny? Hypothesis, observation, data collection. Programming: Make an applet in Scratch (very open-ended exploration, noisy happy group) Week 2 Physics: Variables. Pendilum experiments. Programming: Design a pendilum in Scratch (still open-ended, with a topic though) Week 3 Physics: Scientific communication. ""Silly robot"" games (describe making PB&J sandwich in words, with the ""robot"" doing everything possible wrong; describe your wooden block construction in words from beyond a screen and have a friend reproduce it) Programming: Make your pendilum take user input with multiple variables. ~*~*~*~*~* The gallery with a few of the projects is here: http://scratch.mit.edu/galleries/view/58724 ~*~*~*~*~* From Week 2 write-up: ""To recap, we saw examples of several major approaches to programming a pendulum, including direct animation (creating an instance of every event and then going through them in a slide show manner), repetitious code (turn, turn again, turn again), pseudo-random motion (one object following another, which is programmed to move in a certain way), infinite cycles (turn forever), and terminating cycles (""turn given number of times"" or ""turn until a certain angle is reached""). This is a nice example space to talk about programming methods - we started the discussion a tiny bit, but will continue more next week. Programming approaches parallel the ways people think about the world and make sense of it, but are mediated by one's programming and visualization/storytelling skills."" ~*~*~*~*~* From Week 3 write-up: This week, the modeling task was to have models take input from the user in the form of variables. Different people used different methods for input, mostly keyboard buttons and mouse clicks, but some experimented with on-screen buttons as well. The homework is to finish what you started, and to upload your applets into our gallery, which you can find at http://scratch.mit.edu/galleries/view/58724 Next week, we will start from looking at everybody's applets, making the master list of everybody's variables, and using it to discuss the idea of LAWS, from the math point of view statements about relationships among variables, in real and virtual worlds. For those of you interested in game design, laws create game mechanics http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_mechanics Please put a note of some sort on the screen of your model, explaining what input it takes (e.g. keys 1-6). These applets are open source, and many people will probably be using them. During the meeting, each author explained his or her model's input in words. I am very happy with the atmosphere of creativity and cooperation in the group. The models are getting more complex and involved. I can't wait to see everybody's variables. I bet we have a dozen or two different ones among us!"1084	401	math & physics resources	10/17/09 10:20	I created a gallery for mental math tips and tutorials...

It's a bit abstract (in that it's not step-by-step), but it might help you think about how you want to help your students get started with Scratch. Design studio activities - This is a collection of design activities. Again, it's not step-by-step, but it might inspire different types of activities to try. Beyond the looking - This is a seven-part workshop that a colleague and I conducted over several months with a group of middle-school students. Although it's connected to a storytelling/empathy theme, each activity describes the blocks that are introduced, which might be of interest to you. Learn Scratch - I don't have experience with this set of resources, but I know others have used it and have liked it. It's a series of lesson plans and video tutorials for Scratch. There's more available -- both on ScratchEd and soon to be added. I look forward to hearing about what you try! Hope that helps, Karen"894	552	Need Curriculum Assistance ---quick!	8/22/09 20:31	One more thing...I was reading Linda's post about how she gets started with Scratch and I realized that I forgot to mention the Scratch cards! I think the cards are a really great way to give students freedom to explore different code excerpts that they can then build up into interesting projects.920	552	Need Curriculum Assistance ---quick!	8/23/09 9:48	"From my experience running several Scratch classes, kids really want to make computer games right away. So resources such as lists of game mechanics with popular game examples really help them brainstorm. What I mostly end up doing is letting kids work on their own ideas most of the time, since that's what they want to do, and then devoting 10-20 minutes out of every hour to showing them a connection of a couple of particular Scratch commands to game mechanics. Connection examples: Sensing - Touching color, with Motion - Go to x, y for the maze game mechanic (teleport to the start of the maze upon touching walls) Motion - Point toward sprite, with Motion - Move steps, for chase and resource collection game mechanics (think Pac Man) Looks - Change Effect, with Sounds, for win/lose notification mechanics As students develop projects, they can have an ongoing collection of these, similar to the format I started, but with examples of their own projects, either on a poster on the wall, or on the web. I taught a Scratch class this Spring with only six 75-minute meetings, and some students who never programmed before. I did no formal introduction of computer terms, and indeed very little (probably 20 minutes total) discussions overall, other than helping with particular project questions. However, at the end of the class I went through a basic vocabulary list from a Computer Science 101 class, such as ""conditional statement"" and ""infinite cycle"". Students were able to make examples for EVERY SINGLE TERM from their own projects and those of classmates. It felt like magic."933	552	Need Curriculum Assistance ---quick!	8/25/09 11:23	"well, i went through the entire learnscratch.org tutorials and i think they're suitable to learn the language step-by-step, with a very gentle introduction to programming; my feeling is that the first two parts may be simply given directly to students since they are very simple, but if the kids are really young they may appear somehow long; by the way, i strongly appreciate the approach outlined in the first reply, since i think that it is more engaging to give young students free (yet assisted) time to explore the language and - then - cook down the CS concepts behind"939	552	Need Curriculum Assistance ---quick!	8/29/09 11:43	"I agree with Roberto. I found the learnscratch.org tutorials to be very useful indeed. I start off with the really basics (movement). I use classroom management software to lock the learners input devices and blank their screens while I demonstrate some theory over the data projector. This is usually preceded by: “Imagine we were designing our very own game, where our hero had to walk around a house… blah, blah, blah”. I show them how it’s done, and emphasize that there could be other ways to do it. I unlock their computers and have them repeat what I showed them. So, I found the “LOOK & LISTEN, then DO” approach to work rather well. They get bored with this if you carry on too long, so be sure to follow with a mini project. My grade 6’s are now in the mid-stage of designing their own games in teams of 4. And I am absolutely amazed at some of their projects. No doubt, I’m the one with the knowhow BUT, they are the ones with the imagination."981	552	Need Curriculum Assistance ---quick!	9/15/09 12:58	I have just posted up our revised redware lesson plan at http://scratch.redware.com/lessonplan.html. The plan is suitable for 7-12 year olds learning Scratch over 6-8 sessions. I hope to revise the accompanying videos soon and post onto youtube. Please let me know if you like them or give me any ideas for improvements. They are not as comprehensive as the learnscratch tutorials but leave a lot of room for children to investigate by themsleves whilst ensuring that the basics are understood.1005	552	Need Curriculum Assistance ---quick!	9/22/09 23:25	I'm thinking of creating a curriculum for a group of students ages from 13-15 to teach Programming concepts using Scratch.

My instinct is that you could do it with Scratch, but it might not be too easy. I wrote a little parser that shows how you could build a list from a collection of words provided as keyboard input. You could then create another list to count duplicates. As for drawing the word cloud, the only thing I can think of off the top of my head is that you'd either use the pen to draw letters or you could have a sprite (or costume) for each letter. You'd build up words by stamping sprites on the stage - like Jay does in this project. I hope that helps. When I was just getting started with Scratch, I found the Scratch website really helpful.

There is no 'search galleries' function. The Scratch search (located at the top of the page, to the right) can be used to search for galleries. For example, I'm a teaching assistant for a course this term. I set up a gallery that I named MAS.714 2009.

When it is tilted in direction ""1"" a sound would play. Direction ""2"" would play a different sound. Etc.  Idea was to make an instrument and then build on that. Trouble is that the direction the sensor is tilted seems to have no relation to its numerical output. Even in slow motion. Kids lost interest, which in my book gives Lego an F for these sensors.

(http://www.elginisd.net/webpages/friedag/legorobotics.cfm?subpage=1322098) If kids advance through all the projects quickly and successfully enough, I usually let them ""graduate"" to the NXT kits. But I've also been introducing some kids to the Scratch-with-WeDo option, and it's equally engaging, especially when they are also given the WeDo Extension sets (with additional building ideas). Last year, for a local Mini Maker Faire, I challenged my Robotics Club (http://www.elginisd.net/webpages/friedag/elginbricks.cfm) to build ""circus rides"" (inspired by the ferris wheel project in the extension set), while programming with Scratch. They got very creative, using the Scratch on-screen interface to add music, visual effects, and ""customer"" interactions, and using the WeDo sensors to control the speed of the rides and/or visual effects, or to count out rotations as a method of timing the ride duration. If I had time to work on an ""open"" (free) Scratch-plus-WeDo curriculum, I'd start by mimicing/adapting the LEGO Education WeDo Activity Pack, and also adapt/borrow ideas from http://www.wedobots.com/ and http://www.damienkee.com/lego-wedo-coral-reef/. The main work needed would be coming up with all the sample programs, including the block-by-block explanations. But note also that LEGO Education did a good setting up a kid-stimulating storyline (with videos & graphics) for each of the Activity Pack projects. I think that this kind of thematic play is a key part of LEGO's concept of the WeDo system, and I think it would be key to making any WeDo+Scratch initiative into a ""hit""."1008	914	Ways to use Scratch in Massachusetts with Grade 4	9/23/09 11:58	Do you have any particular subject in mind?1013	914	Ways to use Scratch in Massachusetts with Grade 4	9/24/09 10:03	I'm also curious about the curricular areas you're thinking of.

Yesterday, I had ninja35 and audifreak with me and we were having a Children's Day party.  One of the things we had to do was a shared Scratch project. I started by teaching audifreak how to draw a kingfisher by copying from a picture of one. She continued with the drawing and ninja35 contributed his input. Then we decided to have some fun and made it into a game.  I left the kids to complete it and they had great fun.  http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/audifreak/698625 The children learned how to work together as a team and they learned different scratch skills from one another as one took over when the other got stuck.  I think that Scratch is such a wonderful tool for team projects as well as for individual projects.  I believe that if you form the children into teams where each team comprises students with differing levels of scratch skills, they will learn very fast from one another.  I guess that the facilitator or teacher must be vigilant to ensure that the more adept student does not take over completely but learns to teach the younger (in terms of skill) scratch students."1015	957	Scrolling Backgrounds	9/27/09 7:34	There is a forum topic about it: http://scratch.mit.edu/forums/viewtopic.php?id=2440 I found it by searching the web: Scratch scrolling backgrounds1131	957	Scrolling Backgrounds	10/29/09 12:52	"Not too tough, I don't think.

The trick that I have run into in class is creating an assignment that  provides the right balance structure and autonomy. It's all fun and games. . . even when somebody looses an eye My first idea is to base the lesson on a short familiar story, Odysseus' encounter with the cyclops. www.wsu.edu/~dee/MINOA/POLY.HTM After reading the story, particpants will work in triads to create a game inspired by the story.  Based on the technique of pairs programming, there will be a driver (sitting at the keyboard) and a navigator (reading the criteria and Scratch cards.  In addition, there will be a research and development role  will reffer to the original text and search or creating necessary resources (costumes & sound effects). Participants will then use a rubric and review template to give feedback to other projects.

I'll be working on creating specific materials over then next few days."1115	1209	Reading and Writing with Scratch	10/26/09 21:26	"I like the idea of roles. I would like to suggest that the roles be interchangeable after a while eg. if the time allocated for the project is 40 minutes, will it be a good idea to change roles after 20 minutes so that students get to see from a different perspective. An idea to share: How about creating a scenario as in you paint a particular Scratch background and let your students put in their characters.  For example, using the desert background imported from Scratch, have the students discuss desert people, animal and plant life and things associated with the desert. Then form into groups and let them create a project. They must start in the desert but can choose to leave the desert  so  you can include means of transportation in your brainstorming session.

It's better for them to master one skill-set than to dabble in all of them. In the context of a workshop for teachers, I'd offer the option of changing roles if there is time to produce more than one project. The problem with the format I originally described is that not everyone actually gets to put their hands on  Scratch.  So perhaps I need to schedule individual play time at the end of the session."1119	1209	Reading and Writing with Scratch	10/27/09 9:52	"I really like this idea.  Especially as it creates an opportunity for a cross curricular project.  From an English point of view you have an opportunity to reinforce the different types of conflict.  This project would probably be ""man vs. nature,"" unlike typical action games that tend to be ""man vs. man.""  From the science perspective, you have an opportunity to research ecosystems.  And concepts from social studies, such as wants/needs. and environmental factors that lead to the development of cities could be incorporated.   Also, from a programming/math perspective, I see a great opportunity to use variables to track hunger, thirst, and exertion which all contribute to a variable for overall health."1121	1209	Reading and Writing with Scratch	10/28/09 9:18	"To add to your flow of ideas, you can also look at it from the geography viewpoint and suggest that students in different groups place their characters in deserts in different countries/continents.

I then used an ask block to get the number of sides from the user, so that the answer block stores the number of sides. Using that and perimeter, I can figure out the length of each side. (E.g. if the perimeter is 420, a triangle will have sides of length 420/3=140 and a square will have sides of length 420/4=105). Using the number of sides (in the answer block), I can determine the interior angle (the link from my earlier post). Next, I draw the polygon using pen down, repeat, turn, and move blocks.

What sorts of project do you have in mind?  A group of my students had a ball with Picoboards and a parent volunteer, who came in to help them make Scratch-based music.  He had a prototype of a slide guitar/Scratch project they played with over and over. Karen R."1210	1786	Are PICOboards the only choice?	12/3/09 4:37	Thanks for getting back to me. Yes it is an external sensor board I'm looking for. Basically we have a budget to spend that isn't huge -nothing new there. We are lacking in control technology and I've been looking at the Lego kits to use in conjunction with Scratch. Although Scratchboards went over to Pico' they are only available to buy from the US and they are $50 each - which is pushing things for us as we are a tiny school.  If we need parts or support it is then limiting for us being in the UK. I'm also looking at Go Control software from DataHarvest - I need to be able to use and external sensor for this too. So everything needs to be compatible with the external sensor boards. I'm just trying to make sure we get good value for our money and that I don't leave a can of worms for whomever takes this job over while I'm on maternity leave next year.

I don't know pricing for WeDos, but choosing where to spend the money, you could consider: WeDo motors are lots of fun, programming movement like animatronics, toys, etc.  Downside is you also need to buy Lego pieces, gears and such. Picoboards have lots of different input options--sound, light, resistance, switch.  They are great for making game controllers, science experimenting, unusual inputs for graphic design projects.  You can use all sorts of found materials in building, no extra purchase needed.  They are pricey, and don't have the motor option for the movement projects kids enjoy."1230	1786	Are PICOboards the only choice?	12/11/09 11:27	"Is there any pointer or documentation to what or how to do the ""Scratch-based music / prototype of a slide guitar/Scratch project,"" that sounds very interesting and like something that you'd be hard pressed to pry the students off of.  (in a good way...)"1235	1786	Are PICOboards the only choice?	12/13/09 12:53	"I don't have anything official.  Here's what it involved: Guitar 1.  Understand that one input option for picoboards is measuring resistance in a circuit. 2.  Make a guitar prototype (the parent version was fancy--miniature rock-style body from plywood attached to a fretboard).  Cover the fretboard with a conductive material--he used a thin black spongy material with some metal component new to me.  Make the slide from a film can wrapped in tin foil. 3. Attach wires to the board, can and Sratchboard in a way that moving the can up and down the board will change the length of the circuit and impact the resistance measured. 4.

We (my colleagues are Orni Meerbaum-Salant and Michal Armoni) have already published two preliminary reports in ACM CS education conferences and are currently preparing a final report to submit for publication. The paper ""Learning Computer Science Concepts with Scratch"" maps various exercises in Scratch into a new cognitive taxonomy that combines the well-known Bloom and SOLO taxonomies. It shows what students are capable of learning at this age. The paper ""Habits of Programming in Scratch"" has some bad news: students develop bad habits of program design. Our overall conclusions are that a good teacher is essential to optimize students' learning - big surprise :-)). We have some good new coming out: we traced the students who learned Scratch as they learned ""real"" programming languages in senior high school and found that experience with Scratch significantly facilitates learning. When the teacher starts to talk about loops in Java or C#, the kids say: ""Oh, we know all about loops""! You can download our articles from the ACM Digital Library.

I have worked successfully with Scratch and Game Maker. I've had  success with girls using Scratch, but boys  prefer Game Maker . Game Maker is intuitive and looks more like a shooter up video game. On the other hand Scratch really teaches the kids how to program. If you use Scratch, my advice, is to have prepackaged cool Scratch tricks up your sleeve to start. These tricks can demonstrate how cools Scratch is, so no one gets frustrated with how difficult it is. Both communities have great online presence. Scratch's presence is a more appropriate and kid friendly environment. Game Maker is more graphic, but still Jacob Hapgood does a great job with keeping his program free and updated. I work a lot with Asperger kids, who love computing and I have found that whatever programming environment you put in front of them, they will do great things, without much guidance. Last but not least, the one trick that has been tremendously successful is to have the more advanced students tutor the less advanced students. Everyone likes this. In general, I teach Computer Science in High School using Game Maker, REALBasic, and java. I'm still trying to get Scratch to be taught in the lower grades.

I have taught introduction to programming for many years using Logo. Last year was my first foray into teaching Scratch. This year, I am developing a nine week Moodle course that can be used as a blended, (some are now saying hybrid), course or strictly online. I am a certified Blackboard teacher for the state, but I like developing courses for Moodle as that is what I am used to. Instruction is guided by the CSTA's, (Computer Science Teachers' Association), recommendations for introducing programming to the middle school, focusing on algrorithms and problem solving, (while keeping it interesting to my students). My course is developed around my state's math standards, programming employment standards, and NETS from ISTE. Students will work through a series of PBL lessons and then develop their own PBL. Scratch goes well with labs like mine as an introduction to the career of programming. It would also fit well into Math, Language Arts, and Social Studies, (many projects are story telling). In HS, given more structure than I use, it would be an excellent introduction into a career track. In elementary, it would be a good introduction to logic. It lacks some of the development for Science that StarLogo TNG has, (see Project Guts, I am an after school club leader). Because of my experience conducting a Scratch webinar, I think there will be a group of teachers at each school that could see how Scratch could fit into the curriculum. I hope to present my course to our NM ISTE's conference this spring. Training for teachers could be done in a one day workshop, providing there was other support such as a wiki, online environment, etc. Wiki's are great for developing curriculum. Once students have the basics of using Scratch, its best to turn them loose developing their own projects within a framework the instructor has developed. Basic projects can be suggested to them, but the Instructor needs to become the help desk. Issues for use of Scratch: Would have to be installed on computers using it Headsets w/microphones would be a plus Quality Internet connection required so students/educators could view projects online making sure that the video tutorials are not blocked, etc. Suggested curriculum uses for Scratch would have to be developed for your state's standards I have collected a great set of references and help sites as a matter of developing my course, if you, or someone from the group you are working with wants to know more, let me know.

I talked about Scratch at the Illinois Computing Educators (ICE) conference a couple years ago, and I met lots of teachers doing creative work with Scratch. You might be able to contact some of them through the ICE ning. We've seen Scratch used in many different ways in classrooms. Of course, it is used in some computer-science and information-technology classes. I'm personally most interested in examples where Scratch is integrated into other curriculum areas. We've seen students use Scratch to create reports for social-studies classes, simulations for science classes, and interactive stories for English classes. As students create and share projects in Scratch, they can learn to think creatively, reason systematically, and work collaboratively -- in addition to becoming more actively engaged with particular curriculum content. If you decide you want to learn more about Scratch, you might consider coming to our Scratch@MIT conference in August. Best of luck with your efforts.

Some teachers have expressed that they feel uncomfortable not knowing ""everything"" about Scratch and worry that their students might consequently have unsatisfying experiences. It's great when this worry dissipates, which often happens when we get to hands-on activities and when we discuss (and try) peer-learning strategies. I've had numerous teachers share their creative approaches to collaboration as a means of supporting student learning (and reducing expectations of teacher-as-expert!)"1301	2190	Introducing STEM into curriculum	1/8/10 10:28	"Hi Pam, I just conducted a qualitative study that showed that students can learn Scratch - 28 different types of tasks on their own. These students were 3rd grade students from a blended (special education and general education background). The kids learned from each other by doing - see Papert and Constructionism. - http://www.papert.org/articles/SituatingConstructionism.html I have been working with teachers for over 15 years and for 15 years - we have had the same problems - convincing teachers to teach with or about technology.  So perhaps we should let kids learn and bypass the teachers. I am working with two teachers right now who use learning centers and one of the centers enables students to learn Scratch on their own or with peers. My study stemmed from the Hole-in-the-Wall studies where kids in the slums and countrysides of India learned computer literacy skills on their own. My paper  - http://btcactus.blogspot.com/2010/01/if-they-dont-test-you-on-it.html - if you feel like reading my qualitative findings. The Hole-in-the-Wall studies: http://www.hole-in-the-wall.com/findings.html Kids can learn Scratch without teachers - so let the reluctant teachers  continue to be reluctant and get this great software into the hands of kids!

The windows for Scratch integration possibilities narrowed this year when our district moved to a uniform reading block curriculum and structure. We also added a ""response to intervention"" half hour for skills work, that came out of time previously given to STEM and social studies work.

If you are considering upgrading, I might wait until 10.04 is released, unless you have other compelling reasons. 10.4 will be a Long Term Support release- should be more stable.  With any luck, we'll have these issues solved by then!

Could you share a link to the projects they've been making? What approach(es) to introducing Scratch have you already been using?1358	2383	New here. Scratch in 2nd-5th	1/24/10 0:00	"Approaches?  They are pretty ""ad hoc"".  I realize there is guidance in some of the Scratch material.  I was introduced to Scratch mostly at a Media Lab open house when I worked for France Telecom/Orange Labs.  I had tried a small amount of Scratch with my son Noah at home when he was seven.  It was sort of an alternate activity to bedtime reading. But now, on sort of a volunteer basis, I am the computer teacher at Wayland Academy of Framingham ( http://waylandacademy.org ) and have also inherited care of the website, which needs help.  Since I work at several other jobs and have five older children as well, my time is really limited.  So each of the two days I teach in a week seems to come up suddenly.  I have three classes:  K-1 (10 students), 2-3 (8 students), 4-5 (6 students).  No one else at the school had heard of Scratch (except for one other student, it turned out), but they trust me a fair amount to create the computer curriculum as needed, so for 2010 I deceided to do Scratch perhaps about half the time with 2-3 and 4-5.  (K-1 seemed a bit young, but I figured they might later be an interesting audience for the other classes.) Each class is only 30 minutes, so I did: 1st class) Talk in general about Scratch and get everyone signed in.  (That's still not quite done due to some absentees, but I am straightening it out myself as needed.)  Considering the anonymity and my need to be able to easily work interactively with everyone, I had everyone use their real first name and ""Waof"" (for Wayland Academy of Framingham) for their last name.  Thus, I am ""Bruce Waof"". We all have different first names fortunately.  We all are set up initially with the same password.  I let them change certain details if they were still nervous about security.  Some wanted to live in Africa, but I thought that was a bit much. 2nd class)  I used my overhead projector.  (Just using that in the lab creates a bit of mystique fortunately.)  For the 2-3 class, I did Scratch myself for the whole session.  It was fun.  I pointed out the cat and the eight groups of commands on the left.  I took requests.  ""What should the cat do next?""  I did a lot in immediate mode.  Then I put things in a loop with the ""forever"" construct and soon the cat was bouncing off the walls and making noise.  We added a few more sprites.  I did some weird vocalization. We ended up with this (Hey): http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/BruceWaof/854937 With the 4-5 group, I did similar for the first 15 minutes and let them do their own stuff for the last 15 minutes because they were raring to go. In fact, some were trying to duplicate on their own computers what I was doing overhead though I had asked them to just watch. (Normally they are trying to play games or do other things, but this was very different.) At one point, I was showing the recording feature. This time, I asked them all to make a sound, but nothing that would upset the parents. Somewhere along the line, we had this (CrazyAnimals): http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/BruceWaof/857170 As you can see, they asked to play with images more. Then they were off doing their own things. A few finished a simple project that day and uploaded it. It was a very exhilarating day for me, as have been all the sessions so far with Scratch. It felt like one of the sessions in ""Glee"", if you have watched that show. It went so well, you almost wondered if it was choreographed. 3rd class) I had the students explore Scratch or do projects as they chose. Here are some of the projects that resulted: http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/AlexWaof/844717 (dictionary ball by Alex Waof) http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/Adamwaof/844730 (B, O and B by Adam Waof) http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/mahimawaof/844721 (dragon torture kitty by Mahima Waof) http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/JonnyWaof/844718 (running player by Jonny Waof) http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/TessWaof/857484 (Tess Project by Tess Waof) http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/Artemiswaof/844724 ( aaaahhhhcocococococ!!!!!!! By Artemis Waof) 4th class) I've had a fourth class with 2-3, in which I showed these demo projects I had made: http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/BruceWaof/854603 (Spinning Cat And Fish) http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/BruceWaof/854780 (CatAndButterfly) http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/BruceWaof/854782 (CatAndButterflyAndStar) http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/BruceWaof/854784 (Drawing Cat) I showed them how one could download someone else's project and do their own version by modifying this one from the 4-5 class using the 2-3 class's suggestions: http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/AlexWaof/845522 (costume changer by Alex Waof, a student) http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/BruceWaof/854881 (changing colors, my slightly modified version) I also showed them this one, which I had found from the 4-5 class. (It's a bit like the Flash game hit ""Red Ball 2"". It has four levels, obstacles, etc. I really didn't know what to say.): http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/AlexWaof/849618 (ball game by Alex Waof) Then we did more independent exploration, but 4-5 was scheduled for a field trip. However, one of the 4-5 graders asked if he could meet with me at 9am to talk about Scratch before he went on the field trip. Unfortunately, that is right in the middle of my K-1 class. And that's the story up to now.  Not too much detail, I hope.  I'd like to hear more of the experience of others in the classroom. Where I teach is a pretty neat school to begin with, but it has still been a surprise to see how the students have taken to Scratch so far.

Perhaps you should add this resource to OER commons / Merlot etc?  I was quite surprised to find that the OER repos really don't feature that many Scratch resources compared to how many great already existing Scratch projects there are to demonstrate in  an interactive way many key curriculum concepts.   Lots of Java applets.. not many Scratch links. I would definitely like to use this as a starting point - perhaps we find something that people are going to be more familiar with here than fish as this is a landlocked place...  Let's see... Thanks! -Mike"1376	2429	A New Resource for teaching Scratch to kids ages 5-8	1/29/10 7:14	"Thanks, Crystal, this is very interesting, and I really like the setup! I'm currently targeting age group 10-12, but I would also like to work with smaller children in the future. Here are my comments: - It would be good to roughly indicate  in the resource how much time each exploration will take. - I like the opening activity a lot and I would definitely do it. - I think it's good to defer the green flag to the challenging explorations. I think understanding the difference between preview mode and presentation mode is not  easy, and working in preview mode only avoids this issue - Exploration 1: when you say to the children ""let's get the fish moving"", the natural reflex of many is to drag it around on the screen - task accomplished. How do you explain to them that this is not the point? I haven't come up with a convincing answer to this yet. If you have an answer, it would be very good to put it into the resource. - Exploration 1 again: I think ""move 10 steps"" can be explained easily, but how about ""turn 15 degrees""? Are you talking about the 15 at all, or do you use ""turn 15 degrees"" as a black box that just does some turning? It would be useful also here  to have a hint for the teacher in the resource. - Exploration 6: this seems a pretty tough one to me. In most programming languages, it is natural to do if-then-else  before loops, but in Scratch, that doesn't apply. The ""forever"" block is arguably simpler than if-then, as there is no condition. Even for ages 10-12, I'm starting with ""forever"". For example, you could make the fish move forever and combine it with ""bounce on edge"" to create a very simple yet natural animation of the fish swimming back and forth. Also, I could imagine that the touching-color block together with if-then is over the heads of most 5-8 year old, but in order to really tell this, I don't have enough experience. I'm planning to test it with my 7-year old daughter. - General: When teaching Scratch, is it about Scratch, or about programming concepts? My approach is to teach concepts, and I'm using Scratch as an excellent tool to do it. I think that any resource should carefully reflect on what it is trying to teach. You are saying in the overview that ""students will have enough tools to create their own stories"", and that they can ""express themselves"". It's clear to me what you mean, but if I wanted to be picky, I could say that they don't need Scratch for that. Paper and crayons as in the opening activity would be completely sufficient. What you are really doing is teaching concepts that enable the students to express themselves in a programming language rather than the paper-crayon language. And you can name these concepts: (i) statement (makes the computer do something for you instead of doing it yourself); (ii) script/program (sequence of statements executed in top-down order) , and so on. I'm not suggesting that you rename ""Motion: Move and Turn"" to something fancy involving the term statement, but I do suggest to add a paragraph for the teacher where you make the concepts taught in every exploration explicit. In Exploration 1, it's exactly (i) and (ii) above (snapping statements together to form a script). Thanks again for sharing this resource! Best, Bernd."1382	2429	A New Resource for teaching Scratch to kids ages 5-8	2/1/10 21:27	"Bernd, Thank you for the detailed feedback! I found some of your questions very helpful while refining my resource. I hope I can help with your concern about ""getting the fish moving.""  When you are starting in Scratch, make it clear that the goal is to make the computer do things for you.  The goal is to make the computer do what you want. I think if you take on the challenge of teaching kids ages 5-8 that they are more than capable of grasping many difficult programming concepts.  Even those students that lack basic reading skills might surprise you with their skills and understanding in Scratch.

It will be very well received by the teachers in my school. I introduced Scratch in school as part of a child - led topic week  during the first week back in January. Like you the first consideration for me was the vocabulary that the children would use. Amazing how quickly newly introduced terms become part of their retained vocabulary! As the children had never come across anything like this before, the first activity I did was to give them a sheet of printed out commands from each of the blocks (a bit like lego building blocks). In the hall we then acted out the role of the sprite (which was only allowed to follow the commands they were holding). All the group were familiar with paint and I didn't need to tell them how to create sprites or stages, they just experimented. I think that is where their generation benefits... they have no fear of technology... unlike the teachers who currently know less than the pupils - so I will be distributing your resource in the hope they feel more confident working with it in class. I am hoping to get some students entering the schools computer animation awards (UK) I enjoy using Scratch as a teaching tool.

I really like the way you have tried to incorporate language and vocabulary. I work with young children who have a hearing loss -- but we don't use sign language and I teach them to listen and speak. They are usually learning language and I use scratch to help make language concepts clear, but also to help them recognize the representation of these language concepts in different ways. e.g. the use of 'when', while and ""if..""  syntax in english. I am currently trying to match some of the scratch commands with english syntactical structures and examples. Your project really is on that track and extremely useful for young children!  Hope you continue elaborating on the project.

This topic is close to one a group of us is meeting on-line to discuss on February 7.  If you are interested in joining in, send me a message."1381	2477	Student Learning	2/1/10 7:45	"Hi David, I share your approach; I want the students to understand the concepts. That doesn't mean knowing the ""big words"", as Karen puts it, but being able to apply the concepts in new situations. Some minimal terminology is still necessary, I think, in order to enable students to help others and explain what they have been doing. Terms such as ""conditional statement"" are for the teacher, the students could be taught to simply call it ""if-block"". Now, how to make sure that they have understood the concepts? I'm currently preparing a course where I will try the following: I'm preparing a game where all sprites except the hero are already fully programmed. The students must program the hero themselves. Every level is clearly associated with one concept, and in order to get through the level, students must program the hero according to this concept. Example: a taxi arrives, and the hero must board it. Solution: go to taxi in a forever loop. The taxi in turn checks whether the hero indeed comes along when the taxi pulls out. The necessary new  concept at this point (forever loop) is learned through a specific handbook chapter which explains it and contains exercises.  The idea is that the ""master exercise"" (get through the level) acts as a focus: during the regular exercises, students can play and try this and that, but to get through the level, they really need to understand and apply one particular concept, otherwise it's ""Game Over"".  In order to avoid that students blindly copy their solutions from the regular exercises, there is always a little twist that they discover only when the game goes on. In the taxi case, the taxi stops at some point, the hero must get out and reach a specific entrance area on the stage.  For this, they need to rewrite their forever loop into a repeat-until-key-pressed loop (same handbook chapter), sequenced with a goto x y (previous handbook chapter). I have no experience with this setup yet; all I can say already is that the programming effort on my side is rather high (but it's fun...). If it works out well, I will certainly share the resources."1398	2550	"Need a Scratch instructor in Hartford, CT for youth summer program"	2/8/10 20:13	Are there people close to your location on the members map?

Here's the link to my blog post: http://g4classes.com/learningforward/?p=108 I hope to create something a little more interesting for the next project. (There is some good news about such a simple project.  I ran a Scratch class last Summer and believe a project of this complexity could easily be done by some of the 3rd graders who were in the class.  Maybe the balance board would be useful in a kids' Scratch class.)"1422	2569	Scratch Input Device - Balance Board	2/15/10 17:18	"Thanks so much for the update.

So you essentially have three loops playing at the same time, and you don't hear a noticeable gap. It actually sounds kind of strange and Theremin-like: Sprite 1: When Flag Clicked set instrument to 51 wait 0.33 secs forever play note x for 1 beat Sprite 2: When Flag Clicked set instrument to 51 wait 0.66 secs forever play note x for 1 beat Sprite 3: When Flag Clicked set instrument to 51 forever play note x for 1 beat Where x is of course your sensor input. Hope this helps."1403	2588	better sound script for Pico Board sensors	2/11/10 12:05	Thanks. That script sounded better. It was fun having 5 computers running it at the same time.1411	2588	better sound script for Pico Board sensors	2/14/10 17:10	"Peter and Chalk, Have either of you ever tried having kids play around with music and Scratch? Something like: where the kids would play a song as a group and each computer in the room played a different part - or one computer started the song, and then the next computer would pick up where the last one left off? Reading your exchange on creating sounds just gave me the idea.  I haven't done it with Scratch, but it seems like something kids would like. Actually, I tried something similar to this once with kids and logo, and the kids thought what they produced was great, but that was at a time when it seemed easier to impress students with the wonders of technology. But, even then I think it gave them that satisfaction we want kids to get with Scratch, that they can use technology to create and have fun. Please let me know if you do anything in this area of playing around with music."1425	2588	better sound script for Pico Board sensors	2/16/10 12:51	"Hi Joyce, At Scratch Day last year we had a music workshop which we called ""Scratch Orchestra.""  We experimented with something like what you described.  We had about 30 people, so we divided the room into groups, and each group made a different type of simple instrument with Scratch.  They were all triggered by the keyboard, and each group had a particular note or sound.  Then we experimented with having volunteers come up to the front and conduct the orchestra, by pointing to the groups, or by pointing to big symbols on a whiteboard.  It was fun, and a little cacophonous. A nice thing about it was that it made it possible to do something (kind of) musical with a large group of people in a small amount of time.  With fewer people and more time, I think it would be possible to do a more elaborate Scratch orchestra, with different people playing scratch instruments that made melodies, rhythms and harmonies at the same time."1406	2630	posting scratch projects to other sites	2/12/10 20:28	"Yes, definitely.

Unfortunately, due to the short notice give out about the class, I only had two students plus my own daughter. After delivering my first Scratch workshop I noted serveral items about the students experience in the class. Scratch seemed natural to them. They immediately had a graps on dragging the language elements into a script. Occasionally we had an bug which we all had fun trying to track down due to placement of a language element in the wrong location. Sometimes with quite humorous results. I had to double my time alotted to looking at the Scratch website because the students wanted to see as much as possible of what was out there. We did not have time to see all 1,000,000 projects :-) Both or my students indicated that they would continue using with Scratch at home. We used scratch to build an aquarium simulator in a somewhat guided fashion and then the students were let go to either create their own project or remix another project from the Scratch website. The topics covered were. The Scratch interface Creating and loading sprites Changing the background When clicked forever loops if and if else touching touching random 1 to 2 move steps turn degrees say for 2 seconds play sound until done change y by publishing to the Scratch website It was not possible in the time alotted to work with variables and messages although messaging was demonstrated and variables discussed at a high level. The students were given a three ring binder with the Scratch manual and the Scratch cards in hope of giving them enough tools to continue their exploration. I am currently looking within my school district for opportunities to either teach Scratch to other students over an extended period of time or to educators in a workshop setting."1534	3573	What a Seasoned Professional has to Learn from Scratch	4/26/10 16:47	"On the subject of other learning environments, I've recently heard about Scala ( http://www.scala-lang.org/ ), but I don't know much about it. Regarding the need to use Scratch in ingenious ways to simulate features that are available in some other computer programming systems, yes, that is a fact.  However, to include most of these features on a par with other Scratch features would, I think, be giving beginners to much to worry about and sort through.  Perhaps some of these could be present, but if so, I think it is really important that the complexity introduced be carefully structured such that the environment offered to Scratch beginners remains easy, natural and fairly complete. One of the things that Scratch encourages is combining efforts.  Yet with the features within Scratch, it can be hard to just throw projects together and have something that works and is understandable.  The skill and perception required to combine projects can be much higher than that required to write the individual projects.  Perhaps there are some clever integration techniques that could be added, since community projects seems to be an important aspect of the Scratch message."1540	3573	What a Seasoned Professional has to Learn from Scratch	4/28/10 0:31	"What I really wish Scratch had is the features in the BYOB 2 version of Scratch www.chirp.scratchr.org/blog/ or better yet the features of  BYOB 3 byob.berkeley.edu/. I think with the features availiable in BYOB the jump to higher languages would be easier and could be delayed because there would enough there to teach some of the higher concepts of computing (like recursion). I really, really like Scratch but I think some of the emphasis areas in 2.0 are off the mark. I don't think we need connectivity to Facebook and Twitter (egads !), I think we need a slight improved environment to teach CS concepts. But then being a computer scientist, I am a little biased."1543	3573	What a Seasoned Professional has to Learn from Scratch	4/28/10 10:06	"To add to Toby's list, I'd suggest looking at Greenfoot. It's a Java programming environment that provides a framework with a stage and sprites (""actors"") so you can quickly build interactive games or stories like those can build in Scratch. But the code is real Java -- complex syntax and all -- and you can use all the Java API's. Another cool language is JavaScript. It's interactive, fairly simple, and it's built into most browsers. I haven't looked for any step-by-step tutorials, but I'm sure they must exist. By the way, Scratch *is* programming. While Scratch doesn't require that you master the syntax of a text-based programming language, the program logic is exactly the same as C, Java, Python. In fact, Scratch is used in courses at Harvard, The College of New Jersey, and elsewhere as an introduction to those languages. From all reports, Scratch works very well in these courses because its constructs *are* so similar to other languages. -- John"1544	3573	What a Seasoned Professional has to Learn from Scratch	4/28/10 13:00	"I do lots and lots and lots of JavaScript at my ""real"" job.  I also do quite a bit of Java and C#, too. Java and C# are enough alike that if you write Java code with a ""C""-like syntax, it will probably become C#, more or less.  (Sure, I'm skipping over some differences such as delegates and anonymous functions, etc.) Javascript (more properly ECMAScript these days) is very different in practice than either of those.  It's more interpretive and less strongly-typed.  Javascript is easy to write and hard to debug, which I think is the opposite of what beginners need (and even often us pros, I think).  In my opinion, there aren't any really effective debuggers for Javascript.  The closest ones are Firebug and MyEclipse, but it is still not like the relevant, right-on-top-of-it, debugging of Visual Studio for C# and Visual Basic or Eclipse for Java. I'm sure there are several interesting environments around like Scala and the ones you mention that I haven't really checked out.  But if you want to have fun learning programming with an accepted ""professional"" langauge, I think one viable possibility is to use Microsoft's C#/XNA.  It's free and you can even run your code on the XBox (with XBox membership cost).  There's even a community.  Tutorials abound.  Just Google a phrase like:  C# XNA tutorial .  Some are for those with experience.  Some video tutorials are for beginners and most are oriented around making games.  And if you don't like being in the Microsoft world, remember that nearly all of your C# skills transfer very well to Java.  That said, C#/XNA is an adventure more for an interested high-schooler than the casual 2nd-5th grade Scratchers that I teach. Regarding an earlier discussion, I personally don't worry much about whether one learns recursion, but I think that object-oriented programming is an important concept.  Some of that comes through in Scratch, partly from its SmallTalk heritage.  I miss things like creating objects on the fly more than I miss recursion.  I even miss such niceties as passing parameters or being able to direct a ""broadcast"" to a more specific audience of listeners.  I think that these latter two features, though, could be added to Scratch in an optional, structured way that would not hurt the simplicity and clarity of Scratch as we know it."1545	3573	What a Seasoned Professional has to Learn from Scratch	4/28/10 15:59	"I agree that in naming missing elements that are missing from Scratch, recursion is probably a poor choice. That being said. BYOB is really cool.  It definitely addresses additional computing concepts without adding a huge number of new language elements. They have a ""video"" that demonstrates what BYOB 3 does and it is well worth a look. Even if these elements never make it into the official Scratch, BYOB is still there.The only real drawback is students lose the ability to publish to the web. I totally agree that Scratch is a real programming environment. I have not had this much fun creating software in years ! Now if I could only figure out a way to make a living teaching Scratch to students or educators, I'd be set !"1548	3573	What a Seasoned Professional has to Learn from Scratch	5/2/10 9:32	"Help me understand more of the programming concepts you mention: What are passing parameters, and how is ""creating an object on the fly"" different than programming a sprite?"1550	3573	What a Seasoned Professional has to Learn from Scratch	5/2/10 21:49	"Passing parameters (sometimes called arguments):  In mathematics, this would resemble in many ways a function call.  I'll try to do a Scratch-like example: Let's say we had a project with some fish in an aquarium and we wanted to tell them to change their color.  In Scratch now, we could make up broadcast messages such as ""Fish turn green"", ""Fish turn red"", ""Fish turn blue"", etc.  We'd have a different broadcast message for each color.  If there were lots of colors that we wanted to have the fish become, we'd have a lot of messages.  And if there was a situation where we couldn't anticipate what color we wanted for the fish, we'd be in trouble because we can't just define a new broadcast message ""on the fly"". But both of these problems would go away if we could attach ""parameters"" to a broadcast message.  I'm inventing syntax here, but for instance perhaps Scratch could let us say: Broadcast ""Fish change color"" with ""green"" or Broadcast ""Fish change color"" with ""blue"".  or even better Broadcast ""Fish change color"" with ""Variable: Favorite Color"".  Then we need only one broadcast message and we are able to create variations of the same message by using parameters. Now you can simulate this to a large degree now by having a variable that hold the new fish color and making the broadcast message say:  ""Fish, look at the new fish color now"".  That has much the same effect, but it is a two step process and in some ways is harder to follow in the code. Creating objects ""on the fly"":  Let's say that we made a project where we asked the player ""How many lightning bugs would you like to see flying around randomly?"".  They'd say some number and then what would we do?  Well, if we had made enough lighting bug sprites to match their largest possible number, we could just ""show"" the appropriate number and ""hide"" the others.  But that is sort of a pain because we have to make a large number of sprites and set up a script for each one.  It would be much easier if we could just say, in effect, ""Clone a new lighting bug sprite just like (the original Sprite name goes here).""  In object-oriented programming, we would call this an ""instance"" of the ""lightning bug sprite object"".  So now the number of sprites that we have on the screen is no longer limited to the number that we define before running our project."1553	3573	What a Seasoned Professional has to Learn from Scratch	5/3/10 0:12	"From what I've read, cloning was intentionally left out due to either the intentional or unintentional create of a Sorcerer's Apprentice project that create a large number of sprites and the side effect being using up all availiable ram."1554	3573	What a Seasoned Professional has to Learn from Scratch	5/3/10 20:05	"Parameters are a fairly fundamental facility in almost all computer languages. An example of a parameter is the values that a block takes to decribe what it does, like turn degrees ( being a parameter). It would be nice to be able to send parameters in messages broadcasts or by some other facility. Creating an object on the fly would be defining say ""Sprite 1"" and then having blocks in the program that says make me another sprite just like ""Sprite 1"". This would create a new sprite that acts just like the old sprite but is an entirely new sprite.  Unfortunately this would open up a Sorcerer's Apprentice situation where a large number of sprites could be created which would crash the Java Applet  and comsume a large amount of availiable ram."1546	3672	Looking to Hire Scratch Educator in NYC	4/29/10 11:44	"Hi Meredith, I hope you got some replies to this.

Thanks, K"1535	3770	Negative Comments within the Scratch community	4/26/10 18:04	"Hi Bruce I believe the terms and conditions require a student to be 13 years old to have an account.  What I do with my students is upload their work to my own account.  This way I can also better monitor any comments made (though that is not perfect).  For the most part this cuts back on the negative commenting since it is posted on a teacher's account.  I do get permission from the parents before uploading their work to the website.  I also explain the age requirements for opening an account and that parents must be the responsible adult at home to monitor the account if they open one.  Finally I discuss with the students that there will always be a few ""malcontents"" out there who will make negative comments ""just because"" and they shouldn't take it personally. I have been an elementary school teacher for 32 years and find Scratch to be a wonderful program for my students.  It's unfortunate that the teachers in your school have reacted in such a negative way to this situation. Hang in there and try to win them over by showing them how much students gain.  Perhaps you might consider sharing my lesson plan on Animating Aesops Fables and my student's work  so they might see what the possibilities are for expanding their own teaching. I think it will be self-evident to any good teacher  and you won't have to do much convincing. http://scratch.mit.edu/galleries/view/37347 http://teachersnetwork.org/grantWinners/Teachnet09_NancyCosta.htm Best of luck, Nancy"1536	3770	Negative Comments within the Scratch community	4/26/10 19:06	"Hi Bruce, I'm sorry to hear about your experience with your students using the Scratch site! I think the Scratch site is full of great opportunities for sharing creations, meeting other creators, and learning more about Scratch -- but that's not to say there aren't any problems. As you point out in your message, some of those problems are part of life online. (And interactions with people more generally, thinking about your driver example!) In my experiences of talking to a wide variety of teachers about this subject, some teachers/schools are willing to tolerate some of the problems and treat them as opportunities to learn about interacting with others and self-representation online. Other teachers/schools say that problems cannot be tolerated -- and don't permit accessing the Scratch site from school. Of course, there are things to try other than the kids having their own accounts -- like you posting the projects through a central account, as Nancy suggests. (Just a clarification, it's fine for someone under 13 to have an account, but they need to provide a parent/guardian email address.) I hope you'll keep us updated about your thinking and what happens. If there's anything I can do, please let me know. Sincerely, K"1537	3770	Negative Comments within the Scratch community	4/26/10 19:29	"Thanks for your comments and suggestions. I'm thinking about what you said about the central account idea and wondering about some particulars.  Would you, then, during class have all the computers logged into the same central account?  I suppose the students wouldn't know the password to this account (or else they'd be able to use it unsupervised from home).  So would you then type in the password when they want to upload their work?  Or do they just save it on the local computers? I'm thinking in particular of several students I have that like to work on their projects from home.  Sometimes they turn up in class having made quite major enhancements to what they have done.  (One fifth grader even had one of his games selected for a ""best Scratch games"" gallery someone was putting together.) I'm feeling really mixed feelings about the whole thing.  Some students really love posting their projects and hope to get some comments or recognition (as they sometimes do).   It makes it feel very exciting and timely to them compared to just doing something for our small computer class. I will definitely look at those lesson plans thoroughly.  I like to see Scratch used as a media for learning in other subjects.  (Good examples of that would make for an interesting Scratch gallery or perhaps there already is one.)

When their projects are completed, I save it to a thumbdrive and upload to the central account at home. (Our firewall doesn't permit us to upload to the Scratch site in school). I see your point about  their being able to work on it at home. There is a way to get around that as well.  They can work on it at home, save it to a thumbdrive and update it in class. I think all of these issues are easy to work out.  As the saying goes ""Where there is a will, there is a way!""

As their teacher, I am the responsible party after all. I think a little common sense goes a long way  to ensuring that their participation on the site is always safe and a positive experience. Nancy"1549	3770	Negative Comments within the Scratch community	5/2/10 9:51	"I also use a central account and suggest to kids that they make a personal one at home under parent supervision.  Posting to the school account comes with permission.  I didn't think much about the limiting  impact this has on communication about each other's projects until seeing the online chat that erupted in a different setting, when we made a wiki to share math concepts. For that, I gave each student their own log-in as a trial.  They quickly discovered the message feature, which I was monitoring.  Some mornings I came in to find 30 messages, mostly random  one-line kid chat but often enough about the math that it positively impacted the quality of the pages.  (Then, a couple kids realized they could use the wiki log-in from school to make their own wikis, unmonitored and public.  So, alas, I'm not sure if I'll do this the same way another time.) Anyway, the point is that in the restricted Scratch web environment I allow, I'm not seeing anywhere close to the same level of authentic kid commenting as for the wiki project.  That seems a shame, and worth addressing."1551	3770	Negative Comments within the Scratch community	5/2/10 21:54	"Nancy, I liked your Aesop Fables project quite a bit.  I may do that as a closing project with my 2nd-3rd grade and maybe 4th-5th as well (provided I get to continue with Scratch). --- Regarding the comments, accounts and Wiki discussion, I think it is either clever or a lucky accident that Scratch seems to only allow communication between users as part of project comments.  (Maybe there is another way, but I haven't found it.)   I think that helps to keep things on topic and also makes it relatively easy to cut down on flack by simply turning off project comments (or so it would seem)."1555	3770	Negative Comments within the Scratch community	5/3/10 16:20	Hi Bruce Glad you liked it.  Please let me know how it went with your  younger students.

Do you ""run"" or ""execute"" a program? ""Execute"" sounds rather macabre and computer don't ""run"" anywhere unless you pick up your laptop and run with it! The Scratch RG uses ""run"" but I've seen learning material that uses ""execute"". Any other alternatives? I think I always say ""run"". 2. Do you use the word ""program"", either as a noun or a verb? The RG seems to avoid it and limit itself to ""project"" as a noun and ""create"" as a verb. I use ""program"" both as a noun and a verb. I also use the ""project""/""create"" combination. 3. There seems to be a problem with too much overloading of the word ""block"". Clearly, a ""block"" is the physical unit used to write a program (analogous to ""token"" in an ordinary programming language), but the RG seems to use it additionally for ""instruction""/""statement"", and, of course, many blocks are used for expressions, variables and so on. I call each item in the palettes a ""block"". I call a collection of blocks a ""stack."1570	4110	Terminology	5/17/10 22:45	"Hi Moti, I think run is commonly understood, and it's generally what I use.  But if you want to be creative and specific while avoiding personifying your computer, you could  use instructions in the form of  ""Click the flag to make your cat dance."" I'm guilty of not using the term project consistently, but I try because that's how Scratch saves, opens, and refers to the ""programs"" we create. With regards to a block. it's the pieces of each script and I think it's natural to feel you overuse the word. However, it would be worse to search for alternative names for the same thing. The key to terminology, from where I sit at least, is to ensure you define it so your audience understand its and then use it consistently.

This is how the automatic credit-giving line in remixes works. This works for the most part but as you can imagine there are always ways to get around it. If you are trying to compare two projects that are already on the website, we have a barebones version of a project ""diff"" that gets two project id's and tries to figure out what are the differences.

When you touch the fuzzy select tool to a spot of color it selects all the entire area of color. You can then delete it, which will leave a white background in place of the deleted color. If you want a transparent background, add an alpha layer (from Layers > Transparency) before you use the fuzzy select tool. Then when you delete the block of color you'll have a checkerboard pattern, like Karen described with the transparency fill. Since you have shadows on your green background, using this tool will take out large chunks of the background at one time, but it won't get you as clean of an outline as you might want. GIMP also has a tool called the Free Select Tool (looks like a lasso). This lets you outline parts of your image so you can delete it.

First of all, assuming you have easy access to your IP logs, you can continue to block IP addresses that are only utilized by a single user. It's not an ideal solution to begin with but it's not out of the question. In the event that a problem user is utilizing an IP address shared among many Scratch members, you might consider waiting to inform the user that their account has been suspended until they attempt to login. At that point you can set a cookie on the machine that, when present, prevents the registration of new accounts and/or the use of existing accounts from that specific machine. This could be a traditional browser cookie or an Adobe Flash based cookie. A Flash cookie is going to be browser agnostic and a little more difficult to delete, if only because a lot of users don't know about them, but obviously requires the Flash plugin to be installed. It's not a bullet proof solution and it might prevent subsequent students on the same machine from being able to use Scratch until the cookie is deleted or expired but it's better than blocking an entire school and it might be enough to deter or stem repeated abuse."1596	4248	School systems sharing a single IP / Network address....	6/3/10 9:35	"Thanks for the ideas, Greg! Adding a cookie might be a good way of at least temporarily disabling access from a single computer - as long as the user doesn't know how to clear their cache.

Changing a school to 'highly moderated' mode or some kind of probationary status might help solve the problem as well. Unfortunately, this would be a very energy intensive process.  We've considered the possibility of giving teachers a different status on the website, and ccing reports of inappropriate content by associatied student accounts to them.

However, the kids were generally able to finish in about 1 hour 45 minutes. It is also possible to do a one hour lesson if you don't want to pack too much material in the lesson. As for adequate screen time, perhaps forty minutes to one hour (play time) max a day for children below 11 years. You can extend the length of time if the time is required for school work.  As a parent, you have to take into consideration  the child's character. Please note that  when it comes to drawing with Scratch, some children take a long time to complete a drawing. Hope this helps.

This is now gone and MIT are really missing a trick by not redeveloping this for Scratch 1.4 (which has variable size stage) - it is possible simply to run a scratch app on a mobile phone using java if someone does the right tweaks to get it to run. Can we have this soon please ??1668	5099	Google's App Inventor	7/25/10 16:09	"We agree that it would be good to have a version of Scratch running on mobile phones. John Maloney, the lead software developer for Scratch, has invested some time investigating the possibilities for Scratch on mobile devices, and he points to several challenges: * Performance. Many mobile devices don't have sufficient performance to run Scratch well. That was one of the problems with the Samsung version. * Screen size. It's not easy to squeeze the Scratch UI onto the small screen of a mobile device. Our feeling is that a totally different UI would be needed to author Scratch projects on a mobile device. (Of course, it is easier to create a Scratch player, with no authoring capabilities, for a small screen.) * Lack of standards. There is a lot of variability among mobile devices, so it would be difficult to make a version of Scratch that works on many different types of mobile devices. * Legal issues. A third-party software developer created a Scratch player for the iPhone and iPad, but Apple decided not to allow it, as part of its policy against apps that interpret or execute code. Here's our reaction to Apple's decision. * Our time. The MIT Scratch Team is a relatively small group, so we need to focus our efforts. Right now, we are focusing most of our development effort on creating a new version of Scratch that runs inside web browsers. We hope that this new version will support new types of Scratch projects (e.g., accessing online data) and new types of collaborations. As we work on this new version, we will keep looking for opportunities to bring Scratch to mobile devices.

This page has some information about the proxy settings: http://info.scratch.mit.edu/Network_Installation I believe the proxy mechanism should work on all platforms, not just Windows. For the XO, the configuration file is Scratch.ini in the Scratch folder. I think that works in Gnome as well as Sugar, but I haven't tested it. Note: If you use the Linux version of Scratch instead of the XO version, then the configuration file is .scratch.ini in the user's home folder.

A search of the /home/olpc/Activities/Scratch.activity/ and sub directories did not yield any results. I installed scratch-1.4.0.1-1.i386 as super user and the Scratch.ini file resides in /usr/lib/scratch/directory. The ProxyServer= and ProxyPort= lines in the scratch.ini file (http://info.scratch.mit.edu/Network_Installation) work when the proxy server does not require a username and password. However, the scratch upload fails when a proxy server authentication is required. My instinct tells me that there are a couple of additional lines required in the scratch.ini file   which define the username and password for proxy authentication.

Perhaps you can convince your IT folks to run a proxy server that does not require authentication... On the XO, even if there is not already a Scratch.ini file in the Scratch.activity folder, you can create one with a text editor add the proxy lines. Make sure that the file is readable by world so the Scratch activity can read it. On Fedora, I'm pretty sure Scratch ignores the Scratch.ini file in /usr/lib/scratch (which probably shouldn't have been included) and uses the file .scratch.ini in the user's home folder instead. You can test this by switching languages, then verifying that ~/.scratch.ini was created. (Scratch records the language setting in that file.)

My doctoral dissertation was supported by the Spencer Foundation to work with Dr. Yasmin Kafai at UCLA and focused on using Scratch as a platform for interactive media-art-making. We worked with the folks at the MIT Media Lab to develop and test the first versions of Scratch at an after-school center, called the Computer Clubhouse, in South Los Angeles. Originally, Scratch was designed for the Computer Clubhouse Network to engage youth in programming via media mixing. Much of the research is still ongoing but many of our  findings have been written up in conference proceedings and research articles. I thought I would list the references below for anyone that's interested. We also have a co-edited book that highlights some of our Scratch-related work titled, The Computer Clubhouse: Constructionism and Creativity in Youth Communities (Teachers College Press, 2009). Additionally, I did my post-doctoral work at UCIrvine with Dr. Mark Warschauer. During this time, I worked with 80 second-graders using Scratch in the classroom. A high proportion of these youth had (dis)abilities but were able to do amazing things in Scratch. My current research is supported by the National Science Foundation and the MacArthur Foundation.

Currently I am examining middle schoolers' use of Scratch to tell stories.  In the past there have been a series of studies looking at how storytelling can offer kids an entrance into programming (most notably Caitlin Kelleher's work with the introductory language Alice, see http://www.alice.org/kelleher/storytelling/).  I am interested in how storytelling with Scratch can actually offer more than simply a ""ramp"" to get kids interested in programming but also speak back to the writing process itself, teaching kids how to develop a narrative, revise one's work, and put together the basic elements of a story grammar.  I am currently doing research in a middle school in West Philadelphia, using Scratch both inside a language arts classroom as well as in an afterschool club, exploring kids' creations and how they potentially tie into their development as writers. I am very interested in learning what kind of Scratch stories others are creating with kids and what success educators have experienced with introducing Scratch in terms of English/ language arts as well as storytelling.  I am also getting more and more interested in how kids share their stories online at the website and how fanfiction genres (e.g., Harry Potter stories/ Final Fantasy animations) can offer kids a scaffold not only in how to use the Scratch software but also as a means to navigate the website itself and make wider connections online."1730	5978	Share Your Research Interests	9/10/10 13:13	"My name is Gary. I am a doctoral student at University of Georgia, majored in workforce education. I teach information technology and computer science at Tri-Cities High School. So, I am a full-time teacher and part-time student. My interests are about technology integration in classroom. Now, I got this new tool, Scratch, which I can use in classroom instruction. Thanks for Barb Ericson at GA Tech who directed this wonderful source to me. Hopefully, we will work together more on promoting Scratch in Metro-Atlanta public schools. I am working on my dissertation and trying to find a good research topic. I think using Scratch is under the theory of constructionism that many scholars have studied on. It is great to get connected with best scholars in the field (I cited Kafai and Peppler all the time in my assignments). Hopefully, I can locate an interesting topic to study. See you around."1742	5978	Share Your Research Interests	9/17/10 16:11	I have now posted in the resources section the conference paper which was co-authored by my project supervisor and I.1857	5978	Share Your Research Interests	11/4/10 2:20	"Hello, my name is Yoshiro Miyata.  At Chukyo University in Japan, I have been studying trans-cultural learning, i.e., how we can learn collaboratively across cultural and generational boundaries.  I have been interested in the potential of Scratch to express, communicate, and collaborate to discover meaning that transcend cultural and generational differences. For this purpose, I am coordinating a collaborative project involving members of many universities, schools and community organizations who are using Scratch as a tool to express themselves and their ideas.   We are now running a series of workshops with Toyota City Lifelong Learning Center in our local community in which small children, students, adults and elderies in the 70's are collaborating to create Scratch animations based on narrative stories using scanned hand drawings and recorded voice.  In the past years, we ran workshops in which many children and adults from local Brazilian community collaborated with Japanese participants.  We are excited by the possibilities of collaboration of such diverse age and culture groups. We are hoping to connect these local activities with activities around the world.  Right now, most partners are in Japan, except one school in the US and one in Inner-Mongolia in China, and I'm hoping to find more partners from around the world. We have set up a website for this project:  http://sns.or6.jp/school-news/school-news-english , which links to galleries of Scratch projects and activities at various schools (mostly in Japanese).   We are trying to design this website as a gateway for introducing Japanese Scratch users to the users around the world.   It would be wonderful if we can connect this project with similar attempts in other parts of the world. So, this is a research project trying to look at Scratch as embedded in the learning environments including the web, classrooms, people and communities, and to experiment how we can design such learning environment as a whole so that the people involved can learn from each other, because of, not in spite of, the differences in cultures and generations."1860	5978	Share Your Research Interests	11/5/10 19:13	"Hello Yoshiro I am a PhD student with an interest in programming for children as part of their curriculum and the affective impact of it also.

Right now, students in four universities in Japan are collaboratively working to help elementary school children in Japan, USA, and China (Inner-Mongolia) in learning with Scratch.   It is exciting to have a new partner from Scotland!  (I've never been to Scotland although I've visited Nottingham and York in a study tour with my students.) I'll try to describe how we have been collaborating so far.   We usually start by exchanging Scratch projects to introduce our schools and team members to each other.   (Projects are in this gallery: http://scratch.mit.edu/galleries/view/99695)  One such project has recently been selected as a ""featured project"" on the Scratch site and received many interesting comments from all over the world. (http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/h309017/1340424) Then each class (or team in the class) proposes ideas for collaborative Scratch projects.   Other school members look at these ideas and try to team up to work on ideas of common interests.   For example, children in an elementary school in Japan have studied the environment around their school, such as living things in a nearby river, its water quality, the history of recycling in the community, etc.., and would try to express their observations with Scratch animations.  They are just beginning to learn Scratch, so they will first send their drawings of their animation ideas to the university students, who will try to help the children create the animations. Another example is an elementary school near Boston, which is described in this blog post: http://sns.or6.jp/scratch-network-forum/-collaboration-blog/ideas-from-jackson-school-1109?lang=en I think you might be aware of this school and the teacher. Amanda, if you can describe what you would like your students to learn with Scratch, and ideas for collaboration, we can start discussing how to collaborate. Please let me know if you have any questions or suggestions.  I prefer discussing on an open forum like this, but you can email me at mudpie446 at_mark mac.com Yoshiro"1942	5978	Share Your Research Interests	12/20/10 10:49	"My name is Stephen Quinn, I am a final year student teacher in Belfast, I am completing a study into the use of Scratch in teaching secondary level Maths (for pupils aged 11-18).

The assessment thing has dogged me for 3 years. There's no question that the kids benefit but how much and in what ways. If, say, the superintendent wanted me to justify my salarly with some hard numbers, I'd be caught flat footed. Without going into too much detail, there simply is no shorthand way to measure problem solving or creative thinking and get some nice, chartable numbers that show growth over time. Rubrics ARE a good though labor intensive way. There's a nice article worth reading with some positive research on the reliability and validity of a creativity rubric at http://www3.wooster.edu/teagle/docs/Balchin%20Assessing%20Students%20Creativity.pdf. It seems to me to have a possibility to look as some other, indirect measures that I don't have access to. You said that some kids you see 14 times and others 45 times. So you have groups of kids with well defined amounts of time with you. Well...you COULD look at attendance rates, discipline referals, overall grades, etc of these two different groups of kids and maybe make some valid points about the benefits of being with you more versus less. It wouldn't necessarily give you information about thinking and creativity skills but it could show patterns of positive reponses that indirectly show these skills."2575	6320	measuring impact of Scratch: what tools?	8/2/11 19:40	Hopefully soon I will have some form of measuring impact of scratch.  So far I have measured the affective impact of Scratch in Class ( which has been very positive and happy so far).  I am now looking also to measure the learning impact of scratch.

In a project (see link below) I was creating, my sprite OOgy refused to stay on the yellow path. My son Timothy,  taught me a way to get round thproblem. He asked me to design the sprite with special contact points. If you take a look at my sprite OOgy in the project  ""The adventures of OOgy"" at http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/aitan/1297995, I had initially designed it without the hat and shoes. I had many problems because OOgy could easily get into the blue parts and refused to stay on the yellow path. So Timothy added in the hat and shoes as contact points and that solved the problem. In this project, we used colours for sensing. I believe that  if you design your sprites with specific contact points,  you will be able to solve your problem. However, if the moves are too many, for example ""move 10 steps"" instead of ""move 1 step"", OOgy is once again able to get off the yellow path.  This is exactly the case as described by Karen above.

If the latter, some of the story-telling projects might be fun to try.  For example, have the student take some photos around school, make a Scratch slide show that is just a sprite switching costumes (the imported photos), then record narration about what the photos say about the school as a special place. Link that to reading a picture book about special places such as A Quiet Place by Douglas Woods or When I was Young in the Mountains by C. Rylant. If you're thinking more about using Scratch as a way to practice specific skills, how about having the student make a flash card game that features the sight words he/she most needs to memorize?  The words appear on the screen (sprite costumes again), pause for reading, then have a voice recording that says the word for the student to check.

I encourage people to write all (or at least most) of their sprite's code into a single, long block. It is far easier to make long or complicated code work and to find errors.

Although Scratch isn't new here I don't know  anyone who has worked with the Picoboard or external Sensors.I love Math and know a bit about programming . Claudia , thanks for your answer! From below you can see I had already seen your name somewhere!I am very sad to say my laptop was stolen last year but its still all in my head and will be happy, if you're interested and given time to share code examples. Anyway I hope to redo some projects this year as well as try new ones. Wow,the idea you shared has everything to do with my views on the use of Scratch and I actually did that last year except for the humidity sensor! We saved data ( for example pairs of numbers  , time and temperature )in lists , exported as text,  then opened with Excel and did all kinds of graphs. Found out about Scratch before it was actually introduced in my country, loved it, tried  to learn as much as I could when I could ( time's always scarce...) and am still doing so. Portugal actually has its own Scratch site  only very  recently updated with Scratch 1.4. There is a very comendable organization of teachers here around Scratch.However, although Scratch is great for story telling and getting little kids to learn basic programming skills , here I haven't really seen its use advised for older kids. It has been mostly ""promoted"" for use in Math with 5th and 6th graders and before I prove them wrong some of my pupils say its "" kiddy stuff"",which is a pity when you can also create  interesting programs using more advanced concepts  with grades 7 all the  way up to 12 ( get kids to create ""missing operators"" with exponential and logarithmic functions...) Hope to hear from you Claudia! Here are  some ideas I used : Turned a bycycle upside down, taped a magnetic sensor to one part of the bike and  a little magnet to the wheel.The idea was to get the wheel to spin for a bit and calculate things  like:distance ""travelled"", speed and rotations per minute. Got the idea from the gadget on my husband's mountain bike. With the Temperature sensor got it close to really hot  or cold things and with pre-recorded kids' voices you could hear "" It's soooo hot"" or ""It's sooo cold."" I had thought of a "" talking"" plant who would complain if its soil was too dry but didn't find a humidity sensor in Portugal ( resistive humidity sensor) . I'm going to order from Rhopoint but it's going to really cost me because of shipping. Do you know if can use this sensor to measure soil humidity as well as  air humidity? Another hare brained idea I didn't get to try was a doll with a humidity sensor on an adapted diaper. She would cry out ""Change me"" when water you put in her mouth trickled down to the diaper... With four mercury switches taped to a plate which was then covered with transparent hard case with holes as a precaution and we simulated a steering wheel which controlled a car on the screen. We were very, very careful but the Wedo tilt sensor is of course the way to go. We also filled the screen with flowers of various colours and with the light sensor placed on the screen there was this little bumble bee which flew to where the sensor was.There was only one flower of each colour and at any given time the Scratch program knew exactly what flower the light sensor was on. Anders, thanks for the info. I haven't tried Mesh but it seems to be the only way to control more than one Wedo kit. Of course you'd need more than one computer but with shared variables and broadcasts there are a lot of possibilities...Regarding  resistance, for example I used Temperature Sensor 10 K OHM, Light Sensor 5K to 20 H OHM. Electronics isn't my specialty but after finding the following info I ordered a Picoboard and later on managed to get the external sensors in Portugal except the humidity sensor. Hope  the following info answers some of your questions. Sorry for enormous post.Please excuse any errors! Very best regards, Ana Santos From Sensor Types and Sources: I knew your name was familiar Claudia!

Humidity; Consists of a metal electrode on a humidity sensitive membrane mounted on a ceramic substrate; http://www.rhopointcomponents.com  SYH-1NC. Thanks to Claudia Urrea for the initial list. Note: When using resistive sensors with the XO microphone port, it appears that the interesting resistance range goes from around 2k to 5k. (Experimentally determined; your mileage may vary.) From http://scratch.mit.edu/forums/viewtopic.php?id=6403: 17. How do the sensors convert their input to values between 0-100? From the Technical Info document: ""Scratch maps the 10-bit sensor data onto a 0 – 100 scale using a mapping that is different for each sensor type. Users can access the “raw  10-bit values by shift-clicking on the Scratch Board Watcher and selecting “report raw data . Doing so will show sensor values in the range 0 - 1023. Most of the sensors use a generic linear conversion to report scaled values between 0 - 100. Light and sound sensors use piecewise linear functions that take into account the idiosyncrasies of those sensors. (Note that readings for light are reversed so that more light gives larger values.) Code for scaling functions [are]: Code: generic(n) return round ((100 * n) / 1023) light(n) if n < 25 return 100 - n else return round((1023 - n) * (75 / 998)) sound(n) //empirically tested noise sensor floor n = max(0, n - 18) if (n < 50) return n / 2 //noise ceiling return 25 + min(75, round((n - 50) * (75 / 580)) ) //noise floor and ceiling values might vary 18. Um. OK. But in reality, how do the resistance values relate to the sensor value? Is it linear? Nope. It's not linear. It's logarithmic. From experiments on our board, the resistance sensor value (0-100) that the PicoBoard produces is related to the actual resistance, R, (in KOhms) across the alligator clips by the something like the following equation: sensor value = a*ln(b*R+1) where, approximately: a=19.5 b=0.9 BUT, if you are only interested in low resistance values between 0-10 KOhm, the following simple relation works real well (and yep, it's linear): sensor value = a*x, where a is approximately 5.57"1909	8032	Picoboard and Wedo with Scratch	11/25/10 10:47	"Hi Ana Thanks for your reply.

Also, it'd be great to have an easy way to create ""walls"" or ""floors"" - something that all typical sprites cannot pass through.  Perhaps this could be a stage-only function, where you highlight certain areas (or select all areas of a certain color on the stage) and click a button, designating it as a no-pass-thru zone. One thing that should not change, however - is the stability.  I have NEVER had Scratch 'crash'.  Microsoft's PowerPoint (on my Mac) is much less stable than Scratch.  I tried ""Alice"" on the Mac - crash city!

Commitment by installation: From the science of persuation, we know that people tend to act in consistency with their past actions and statements. Downloading and installing Scratch constitutes a clear commitment to use it, and the installed icons present a constant reminder. Visiting a website and running Scratch there does not create the same commitment, and does not leave the same kind of visible reminders. 2. Bad company: I told my 13 year old son, proficient in Scratch, that in the future it would run in his web browser. He replied ""You mean like those bad internet games?"". Scratch risks to be associated with a lot of simple and low-quality games that are out there. 3. System requirements: I have obtained a collection of old laptops that have become obsolete at my workpace, for use in promotion of Scratch. The laptops have more than sufficient performance for Scratch in its current version, and even have proper tall screens. (I often tell this one-line joke: ""'How wide would you like your screen to be?', asked the man with the chainsaw."") The local school has a good collection of even older computers. If performance requirements increase with the new version then it may not be possible to run Scratch on machines that run it today. 4. Documentation and translation: All Scratch documentation, and translations thereof, must be laboriously upgraded when the user interface changes. This should only be done for good reason, obviously. Considering these points, my suggestion would be to make the browser version of Scratch more or less exactly the same as the free-standing application, and to continue to provide an installation file. Obviously there is a need to also run Scratch on offline computers, so I assume that this is being taken care of. A suggestion was made earlier is to make language expansions available through a level setting. This appears to me as a good way to expand Scratch while also keeping what we already have, which is very good.

I have been programming since 1980 but lack a background in education. I've found it very frustrating, this apparent lack of interest in the public schools to teach CS. I looked into an M. Ed. in Secondary Education program at my alma mater, West Chester University, and CS is not even an approved concentration area. But they do offer a Level I Post Baccalaureate Teacher Certification Program – Elementary Education, with a concentration for grades 4-8. So I need to get my teaching credentials first, and then I will have this uphill battle which is the subject of your blog. I have joined the CSTA but they are focused on public education, so I either need to get into the public school system or just teach this subject through workshops or one-on-one tutoring. But the good news is I've discovered Scratch. I'm now writing my first program with it, which is the game Reversi. This was actually the same game I used to learn programming back in 1980, using assembly language on an Atari computer. I think it will be a good test of Scratch's capabilities. I'll let you know how it goes. I hope there is some more discussion of this very important subject you've brought up here.

Thank you for sharing. I teach a middle school Student Technology Leadership class. ""Your body as keyboard and mouse"", a UI project, lights my kids up. I'm trying to come up with a game concept, using Kinect for whole body interaction, that teaches addition and subtraction of positive and negative integers. What I keep running into is that treating the idea of positive and negative quantities ( debit and credit transactions in a bank account) is too abstracted. Movement, right/positive and left/negative, seems to be easier to grasp because it is spatial. Scratch2Kinect lends itself to this task.

It appears to be caused by network security measures that manage cookies independently of the individual computers themselves. If you can pass the information onto the people in charge of your network, we'd be happy to discuss this with them to try to help sort this out. Here's a synopsis of our understanding of the issue: The Scratch website, like many others, uses ""cookies"" to keep track of the user account that is logged in. A cookie is a small file placed on the user's computer. All that ours does is identify the account that has logged in. Sometimes problems arise when networks try to manage the cookies on their own, instead of allowing the site to place the cookie on the user's machine. If the network gets mixed up or isn't configured properly, it can start to assign the wrong cookie to the machine(s) on the network.  As a result, the people using that network will start to get logged in as the wrong user. The solution is to fix the configuration of the network, or allow sites like Scratch to write the cookie directly onto the user's machine (which is the way it works with most network configurations - still very secure, and an industry standard). Not sure why you had no trouble logging into google docs, but they may use a different system."2081	9109	Scratch courses for educators	2/20/11 20:33	"Hi Roberto, One option in the US, we're hoping to be able to offer our Creative Computing workshop again -- http://cs4hs.media.mit.edu/ If I hear of anything else, I'll be sure to pass it along!

The menu will show 'Write Multiple Project Summaries' which will let you get summaries for all the projects in a folder. I just tried it to see what would happen -- it creates a separate .txt file for each project, but in each file it does show author and history of saves, etc. It's not quick since you need to download each project to a folder, but once you have them all downloaded, you could generate the text files with that one command. Would that be helpful for what you need? --Sandie p.s. ...and then maybe if you combined the summary parts into one text file, you could use Scratch to read in the text, parse it, keep track of how many projects per author, etc....   Okay, I guess that's not a quick solution!"2123	9269	Techniques for Stories and Games	3/13/11 12:31	How was the workshop?

Whether it's comments with the scripts or a description in the project notes, I feel like some documentation of a project is incredibly helpful and, therefore, a good habit.

(Using i, j or k for counting variables, for instance, is acceptable, but otherwise variable names should be realted to the program and the values they carry) - Some students prefer to use: if condition then end if if not condition then end if Instead of the if/else structure. Using ""if/if not"" may be acceptable initially, but students should eventually transition to ""if/else."" Two problems with the ""if/if not"" are a) sometimes students do not negate the condition in the second ""if"" statement, but they write the opposite condition themselves, and they do not do so incorrectly. For example, ""If x < 10"" and ""if x > 10"" as the replacement for ""else""... the case ""x=10"" is in limbo. b) There may be actions in the first conditonal that may also trigger the second conditional. I do not have a ""real life"" example in mind right now, but the following illustrates the idea. if x > 10 then ....x = x-5 end if if x <=10 then ....do something else here end if We can easily see that if, for example, x = 12 both conditionals become true! - Recycling variables to hold different types. (This can be a really bad habit which needs to be fixed before they move on to other languages (like Python) in which variable declarations are not needed, making matters worse.) What I mean with this is that, in some parts of the application a variable holds, say, a number, and later on a string is assigned to the same variable. - Forgetting the ""stop script"" block at the end of a script. We know Scartch stops scripts automatically, but since the block exists, we should use it. My hope is that getting used to ending scripts with this block will help students in the future remember to close open files, close socket connections, close database connections, etc. (I can dream, can't I) If I can think of something else, I will post it. Thanks"2220	9388	What are the worst Scratch programming practices ?	4/23/11 11:36	"Hi Angel, I have never required my students (grades 3-6) to use the comment part of Scratch becuase I didn't like how they were displayed and I think students would have a hard time explaining their code beyond reading through their blocks. What age group do you work with? How do you introduce comments? Also, I have never thought to instruct students to use the stop script block when their code naturally ends. Mostly, because a lot of what my students create .. never ends. It is an interesting thought though. Do you explain that it stops anyways? How do you go about explaining the need for this block? I have thought of stop script more of a break statement and not a file close. Maybe I have been misleading myself. Susan"2222	9388	What are the worst Scratch programming practices ?	4/25/11 1:07	"Hi Susan, I teach kids quite a bit older than yours. Using comments can be a great tool to help students plan (design) their scripts once they learn the basics of using Scratch. Think for example of someone learning woodworking: you first learn how to measure, cut, sand, make joints, select wood pieces, etc. Once you have this basic level of mastery, you then move on to know how to make furniture, cabinets, etc. However, you would probably will not start making a chair without at least a basic scketch of what the chair is going to look like, what wood to use, what dimensions and so on. The way I see it, there are two main kinds of comments students should get used to. One that we use to explain how something was implemented. The idea here is to communicate to others (or to ourselves, for future reference) about how a fragment of code came to be. Sometimes, we have a complex nested conditional structure, a tricky ""repeat until"", an intricate broadcasting system, or just a ""bunch"" of blocks trying to achieve a simple logical task in our program (for example, drawing the outline of a pine tree using the ""move"", ""turn"" and the pen blocks in the context of a winter scene). These are all great candidates to be documented. If something took a lot of (trivial) work to achieve, or effort to figure out, it should be documented. (Superfluous comments, however, should be avoided.) The other kind of comments are related to the planning of the program. These are like the actions in a cooking recipe (e.g., ""whisk the eggs and sugar"" is a good comment for the set of steps needed to complete this task). I use them to oultine the different (high-level) actions a sprite is going to do. These comments can also be the result of a brainstorming session with the students about what the sprites should do, and in what order. The comments also help in keeping track of what has been implemented, and what is yet to be done.  I attach these comments to their corresponding ""When"" blocks or to the first block implementing the action described in the comments. It is very tempting to start throwing blocks at scratch and see what it does, and this is Ok when experimenting or learning new blocks. However, whenever you are building an application with the students (in a tutorial, for example), I think it is a good idea to provide an overall picture of what you are trying to do by using comments to describe the high-level actions your application will take. When assigning projects, you could have the students first describe what they want to achieve using comments. You can then check their ""plans"" and point out things that are missing, not clear, or just need a different approach."2227	9388	What are the worst Scratch programming practices ?	4/28/11 6:00	"I was afraid that a topic like this one would come up sooner or later, and that we're going to indoctrinate kids with what we as adults are considering to be ""best practices"", a term which in itself suggests an unhealthy dose of ideology. Whenever I see a project on the Scratch website that truly amazes me, looking at the code is a bit of a downer, because it's usually full of gargantuan run-on scripts, global variables, forever loops and race conditions. But - and that's my point - the project impressed me so much that I wanted to look at its code in the first place. Scratch is cool precisely because kids can produce programmed content right away, without first having been instructed in what to avoid and what to adhere to. Sure, more often that not the code is plain ugly, but - and that's my point - that doesn't stand in their way to create and share. So, you don't *have* to initialize variables in Scratch. Nothing breaks of you don't, they're initially zero. You don't *have* to use the green flag hat block, in fact, I often don't. Instead you can use - say - a mouse click or a keyboard event to trigger things (and to initialize and reset values). It's okay to leave un-hatted blocks or incomplete stacks ""floating"" around the scripting area, because you can use them to debug your project (by double clicking on them) or as a quarry for features you might want to add later. It's also perfectly okay to nest conditions if that makes it easier for you to keep track of your reasoning, instead of using - equally(!) - nested predicates. The ""stop script"" block's *only* raison d'etre is to terminate a perpetual loop  in case a stop condition has been met, surely not to end a script that just plain ends. What's wrong with using just ""if""? Often times you plain don't need an ""else"" case. So kids produce stacks of if conditions instead of deeply nested If/Else ones. I can make out performance issues with this, but OTOH I'd rather read a stack of simple conditions than a cluttered mess of nested ones. So, Scratch variables don't need to be ""declared"" (in fact, they do, when you ""make a variable""), but they are not restricted to a certain type, and can store either a number or a string (or, in BYOB, even lists, sprites and blocks). Is it really ""bad practice"" in the adult world to exchange a variable's value with a differently typed other one? Most modern programming languages let you do this, Scratch itself is written largely that way, and it's awesome (plus, it undoubtely works!) :-) Most of what's ugly in the Scratch projects I'm talking about is rooted in Scratch's inability to allow for user-defined procedures. This deficiency forces kids into a copy & paste metaphor of creating code which is so hard to edit later on. But I understand that this issue is being addressed by the Scratch Team in their current rewrite for v2.0. Until then, let's not tell kids what's ""right"" or ""wrong"" and let's asses other programming languages for why so many of them cannot cope with ""child-like"" practices that are easily handled by Scratch. Let's press those other languages to become more like Scratch! ;-) --Jens"2230	9388	What are the worst Scratch programming practices ?	4/29/11 14:30	"I understand your point and pretty much agree with it. I use these 'best practices' to show students how they can improve their projects. If you cannot convince them that what you propose makes their scripts better, then they will not use it. There is nothing wrong with teaching students to organize and tidy-up things. I also have another goal in mind. After Scratch, my students move to a non-graphical language in which, for example, indentation and variable types matter. So, I want to make them aware of things issues to help them with the transition."2344	9388	What are the worst Scratch programming practices ?	7/7/11 10:30	"On Nested If's: I agree with Jens comment: ""I'd rather read a stack of simple conditions than a cluttered mess of nested ones.""  Readability trumps performance in my mind for kids just starting to learn.  The question I ask is which better facilitates understanding? Talking To Yourself (A Good Habit): I like to have kids read their code out loud.  Especially when trying to debug a problem.  I will also ask them to explain what each tile will do and at times point/draw/explain what will happen when that particular block executes.  Early in my career, I had a mentor tell me to ""think like a computer"" and later in my career I had someone suggest I code out loud to try and understand what it does.  I was amazed at how much reading out loud helped me. For one it slowed down my thinking and forced me to focus line by line instead of imagining what the next large chunk of code would do. I was often wrong when I guessed, especially since when I started to guess because it wasn't doing what I expected, I had the wrong mental model/image of what was going on. First Do the simplest thing possible to make it work, then refactor -  Kids are motivated to get someting to do what they want (play a game, imitate Mario Bros, etc). Now the question is once they accomplished what they care about, how do you get them to the ""hard fun"" and have them refactor (which I will define as: clean up their code to improve readability, reduce complexity and increase maintainabilty)? Good quesiton, suggestions welcomed ;) As they now have accomplished their goal, what is the point (ie: why should the kids care, if it does the same thing).  One way I try and deal with this is if multiple kids are working on the same task and one accomplishes it with a ""more elegant"" script, is to have the the one kid show their script to the rest of the class. I may then also add specific words and comments as to why I like that script and how it is much better than one I wrote (I always try to make myself the fool as opposed to one of the kids, plus it comes naturally to me ;) User Defined Procedures/Blocks: Amen.  This is really needed.  Also something akin to siblings in Etoys where sprites share a common script (but the variable values can be different) would be very useful and avoid the copy and paste we are teaching (a really Bad Habit, I see too often, and I'm not talking about kids I am talking about ""professional programmers"".)

I like the read-aloud idea, I will try it in my next classes. Re.First do the simplest .... Yes, it is hard to get the kids to put back their code on the workbench for the sake of ""easthetic"" improvement.  I wonder if I should try to get them to read their code a couple of weeks later, to get them to experience how hard it is to decipher programmer's intentions  ""from the outside"", therefore persuading them that a bit of tyding is useful.

Commenting your code is a practice that is never too early to implement. Commenting the code makes the code more readable; not only for the coder, but for anyone who reads it. Have you ever looked at a Scratch project that had no comments in the code? Was you able to follow it; to understand what was happening? I'm sure some people can, but not everyone will be as familiar with the code. Coding comments also helps the coder throughout their coding processes.  Have you ever stopped in the middle of a project, only to find when you came back you had to refresh your memory about what you were doing and what you wanted to do next? Along with commenting the code, I also have students keep a journal for each project which will contain the basic concept for their project, notes, questions, needs, and a psuedocode workup. Another great reson for code commenting is your students are using/improving thier language skills."3298	9388	What are the worst Scratch programming practices ?	7/9/12 22:51	"I'm a little late getting to this thread, but if anyone is still interested... In my colllege CS courses I tell my students that any time I'm tempted to put a comment in my own code, I take that as a sign that I should rewrite that section of code instead, to be less clever. This isn't because I don't want program documentation.  But I want it to be high-level, a text file separate from the program that explains its data structures, the large structure of the program, the user interface, and so on.  Along with reasons, if known, why things are organized this way rather than some other way. None of that lends itself to inline comments in the code. As for the other things, I agree with Jens that for kid programmers (up through age 18 or so) there's no such thing as a bad programming practice.  There are better programming practices, and sometimes I'll try to teach one to a particular kid.  But presenting kids with the sort of list of commandments attempted in this thread just makes programming skool, instead of being fun."3834	9388	What are the worst Scratch programming practices ?	2/10/13 8:15	"Whenever possible code should be self documenting and require a minimal number of comments.... (As code gets older these comments will often get copied and then the code underneath modified away from the original meaning). A functional call with a descriptive name is often better than a comment.  Having said that, any time you make assumption you should document them with comments... Here is a typical monolithic program with everything in one procedure....It is documented with comments, but compare it with below... Here is a more modularized approach... The main routine is shorter and you only need to concern yourself with the external calls if there is a problem in that code, and then you have a smaller chunk of code to deal with.  Incidentally, this code is just to illustrate a point, it can certainly be improved.. Also if you are using BYOB, do yourself a favor and create this block (it is just a function block named ""//"" with a text input field): It will allow you to insert comments in blocks or anywhere."2161	9410	Advocating for Scratch	3/27/11 13:07	"In this conversation, Karen made the excellent point that while Scratch is a cool thing on its own, its advocacy is about more than introducing students to computer programming.

I am currently a member of CSTA (Computer Science Teachers Assocation  http://csta.acm.org/ ), whoes main goal is to promote the teaching of computer science (in K-12).  I am presently running for a position on the board as the K-8 representative. I believe that computer science, which is at the core of the development of new technologies, should be taught to all students. Teaching computer science is essential to the development of critical thinking and problem solving skills. Computers are an integral part of life in the 21st century, and our schools have an obligation to prepare our students for the future. Traditionally, students are first exposed to computer science in high school as part of an AP computer science class. However, I believe it is extremely important to grab students’ attention long before their first AP course. Consequently, I believe that the age which students are taught critical computer skills is an important issue.  It seems that Scratch would  be the ideal avenue for introducing younger students to basic programming concepts while at the same time igniting their curiosity and imagination. In regards to advocacy, the first step would be to push for legislation that requires computer skills in the k-12 curriculum.  A bill had been proposed, The Computer Science Education Act (of 2010), http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h111-5929, but did not make past committee.  I believe a more united effort is needed for this to come to fruition.  Lets work together to make this happen for our students and our schools."2176	9410	Advocating for Scratch	3/30/11 21:50	"Hi Vicki, Let's talk! :) Patrice"2181	9410	Advocating for Scratch	4/1/11 13:04	"Interesting to think about your coments in comparison to the newly elevated profile for engineering in US elementary schools.  It is part of our (Minnesota) science standards, but we have no state standards for technology or computer science.

The group would be comprised of like-minded educators whose goal is to effect change on the grass roots level to promote computer programming in the K-12 curriculum, in after-school programs, and in the home. As a whole, we do not have to be a homogeneous group to be effective; we can come from different perspectives, have different agendas, and have different teaching and learning styles. What we will have in common is a desire to promote the use of Scratch as a means by which to facilitate substantive changes to the approach to how we teach 21st Century skills.

Modern machines have gigabytes of memory and 8300 numbers would only be kilobytes of space. The reason the memory allocation isn't increasing is becasue the memory manager would allocate blocks of memory.

People always say we need more ""female-oriented"" or ""female-friendly"" examples in our CS1 courses, but I hardly ever see concrete examples. I once read (and the reference escapes me right now) that giving a context in which CS can help solve/address/increase awareness of social and environmental causes may entice more females into the technology field. I think one of the examples given was http://www.darfurisdying.com/ , among others."2264	9743	Females and Computer Education	5/20/11 7:02	"I think that at age of 12 years students already have build their opinion about CS. Girls think that CS is for boys, any boys thinks that it is for geeks. Teachers have to find better ways to motivate girls for CS.

As more cool/uncool marketing is pushed down to younger and younger girls to sell dolls, clothers and accessories, etc. (I mean, where was the store ""Justice"" 15 years ago?) the new ""normal"" is to be less curious and succumb to peer pressure (or whatever is on TV/Cable/Internet).  I will not be surprised if a new study comes out showing the proportion of 6-9 yo girls playing with Legos dropped from 15-20 years ago versus today. As everyone on this board attests, Scratch is wonderful because it can capture the imaginations of the younger set and is gender neutral -- you can work on whatever you can imagine! Another positive development I see is the relatively recent offering of Leg Wedo kits www.media.mit.edu/sponsorship/getting-value/collaborations/wedo which unlike the Lego Mindstorms product line, comes in very bright colors and is appealing to the younger set regardless of gender.    Nice that it was developed by the MIT crew, and works with Scratch!  :-) The kids will take to these if the adults let them, offer it to them, make it available. *** Link to AAUW advocay group paper ""Why So Few?

I can live with that. The CPU is the one that actually ""goes"" here or there by changing the value of its program counter --different architectures use different schemes, but the idea is the same. In a x86-based architecture, for example, a conditional statement ends up as a series of instructions for evaluating the condition, a comparison instruction (CMP), the selection of the right course of action using one of the many jump-on-condition instructions available (like, JNE for ""jump if not equal"") and possibly using an unconditional jump (JMP) for implementing the ""Else"" part of the conditional (anyone remembers assembly language?). I once had a professor that used to say ""and the program goes here if the condition is True."" This was very peculiar to me as programs, like recepies, are passive elements (Ok, putting self-modifying programs aside for the moment) and as such ""they"" do not do anything. One funny thing that always comes up, is that some students would end-up blaming the CPU when something goes wrong in their programs not realizing that ""they"" told ""it"" to do exactly ""that."""2263	9762	What to call flow of control with 3rd - 6th graders?	5/20/11 1:56	"I just realized that the subject of your post and the description you gave are slightly different.

In my opinion, it depends on the age group and extent of exposure/familiarity of the student to related computing knowledge. If the person is much much younger, or if s/he is a beginner, then that is exactly what I would say. It preserves the programming concept and yet does not overload the beginner with too much ""unnecessary"" info.

I have just begun writing up my findings, and today I wrote this letter of introduction that you might be interested in. This is just the very beginning of my work. I will send me an email and perhaps we can talk. I want to collect statistics (hence your book) etc. I had been a computer programmer for many years and after TA-ing at Harvard Extension, for a friend, in Distributed Java I decided to switch careers and retrain as a teacher. At the age of 53, I found my vocation. I retrained at Harvard Extension with Sue being my premier teacher while I earned my Instructional technology licensure. Six years later, I teach a Basic Programming and Game Making course, an introduction to Object Oriented/ Java course which includes a summation game component, and an AP Java Exam course at Marshfield High School. During my first year of teaching, I was fortunate to have a bright and talented student on the autistic spectrum. I immediately saw the compelling connection between students on the spectrum and computer programming.  Although programming is thought of as a solitary act, it can be the student’s first positive social experience, and indeed, can serve as a potential and viable career path. I immediately spoke with the Marshfield School district head of Special Education, Ms. Susan Dupuis, and within minutes had an after-school Marshfield Kid’s Konnection class teaching (MIT’s Scratch programming environment) to special needs students from kids 8 to 12. In addition, I began tutoring students wanting extra guidance. My work with the students on the spectrum has been very gratifying and successful. For six years now, I have been teaching high school computer programming classes, running private classes, and holding tutoring session, and have watched with great gratification and satisfaction students exceed all academic expectations, and enjoy social possibilities never expected from programming experiences. I am working with the Scratch team and am in the process of writing my complete findings. Young talented autistic students find a comfort zone and interest they had not found before.  These students go from invisible students to Marshfield icons through their work that transform them into game-making super-stars.  The affordances do not stop there; the younger students that I work with Scratch discover a new medium that captures their interest in a way that is so all consuming that it is fascinating to watch.  A serious young student of 12 that I have worked with for three years best describes my work with less talented autistic students. Interestingly, his enthusiasm for Scratch is not daunted by his lack of progress or (at least my definition of progress). He has always kept his work private, and I was forbidden to post his work to my Web site. During this Scratch Day at MIT by the time I sat down, he had proudly showed his work to his father and the entire table. I was flabbergasted and delighted, walked away with the assurance that he and his dad did not need my help. I wish I could say my efforts to get a Scratch component taught in the lower grades have been successful, but for 6 years I have advocated and been turned down by the administration. Therefore, I have chosen to put my efforts into integrating Scratch in all school Special Education units where they are more receptive, and in all honesty, where I personally get the most satisfaction. I could go on but I think you have read quite enough already. I have two Web sites; one is for my private work at http://vickigold.com and the other is for my Marshfield High School work at http://goldclasses.com. I would truly appreciate an opportunity to talk with you about my work, and the direction you think I could go. Thank you for listening.

I am a multimedia teacher and professional developer in Queens New York.  I also work with students on the Spectrum.  Right now I am observing how 2 students on the spectrum interact with Scratch.  My study is focusing on using bogs/scartch for blogging.  e.g. Do students give feedback - click the heart?  Do they write a comment?  How much support is needed?  Scripts? Will students eventually make friends or follow specific Scartchers? I am writing to you in hopes that you have had some experience with this aspect of using Scratch with your students on the Spectrum?  Have you focused on the ""commenting"" aspect of the program?  What have been your experiences.  What potential do you see?

It wasn't Scratch it was a Java lesson that went very well. A few days prior to the session she sent me the programs. During the session we discussed her problems and ways to solve her problems. We talked about using the debugger. While in discussionn I emailed a few but not all the solutions back to her. I think our discussions were very casual and she was more relaxed  then had met in person. I think the same for hold true  for Scratch, but I think a lot depended on her age.

The other alternative I am aware of, and more viable for what you need, is Google's AppInventor (http://appinventor.googlelabs.com/about/).

Dimitris"2686	10109	Teaching elementary students about variables...	10/12/11 19:10	"You should explain what a variable is in both uses, math and science. A variable is aan unknown and can be anything. In computer science, variables are used to hold temporary/changing data. Using the variable ""i"" as a counter in a loop is a basic use; but demonstrates the temporary and changing data structure of a variable. But variables can hold other data types also; words/text, booleans(true/false, on/off, 0/1,..) and can be very usefuls in programming. One Scratch project I developed for teaching is a clock. (This can be viewed and downloaded on the scratch site at http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/TinkerZone/2025446) This clock uses 8 variable throughout the scripts. The clocks movement and time keeping is math and scripting. If you download the program and study it, you will see how I used the variables throughout to accomplish this.The clock actually keeps time reasonably well. (especially since there is no connection between it and the system clock) Other uses for variable involve user interaction. Certain user input should be held by a variable. a calculator is a good example of using variables. When you input the first number it is assigned to a variable. Then you choose an operation and input a second number which is held by another variable.  Then the calculation is done and the answer is stored in another variable.  If the calculator stored these input values permanently, the application would eventually become unusable due to size.  By storing temporary information in a variable, the program remains intact and the temp information is deleted when it is not needed. If you open a Word doc and start typing, everything you type will be placed into a variable(s) until it is no longer needed or saved. The blank document that is created when you open the program is being held in variable until it is saved or deleted. OK. I got long winded. Sorry. :) I hope I have helped to shed some light upon variable and the uses and reasons."2984	10109	Teaching elementary students about variables...	2/24/12 14:06	"Based on the fact that students are usually ""afraid"" of variables -either because of their dull names (x) or their arithmetic values, I think an easy way to teach them is using the following very simple Scratch scenarion: Scratch dialogue where ""answer"" is indeed a variable with a very nice, human-friendly name and an obvious value! My students even got to love the math variables ;)"2990	10109	Teaching elementary students about variables...	2/26/12 20:16	I have taught 3rd graders using Scratch before and I have found that starting with a score variable is the easiest way to get them engaged since most of them know what a score is and know what they want it to do ahead of time. There is no hurdle of trying to explain why we want the variable and why it is useful. This also makes it easy to reenforce resetting the variable at the beginning since most students want their score to reset to zero at the beginning.2991	10109	Teaching elementary students about variables...	2/26/12 20:18	"I totally agree, these chat-bot type lessons are also very intuitive for students."3118	10109	Teaching elementary students about variables...	4/20/12 3:58	"Thank you all for your response...

(Please excuse me if I am confused.) For animation, I would use Blender. It is an excellent animation studio which is reasonably easy to learn. Currently, I am teaching beginning programming using Scratch to elementary students. I plan to introduce some animation using scratch, but plan to go further into programming; gaming, applications, etc. Scratch is a grreat tool for introducing the basics of programming. Flash is a great tool for animation, but its true strength is in programming. Flash requires a higher degree of computer programming understanding. My background: Computer science, 10 years experience. I program in many different languages; VB, Java, JS, C#, C++, Perl, PHP, and others (If I haven't used the language before, give me a short time and I will). I have taught Robotics, Web design and applications, Flash design and programming, and Computer programming. I also tutor in math, science, ELA, throughout the educational levels. (Elementary - College) I will gladly offer my insights and opinions; answer any questions to the best of my ability, and help in any way possible.  (The expression, ""Pay it forward."" comes to mind.

I will try to keep up with the rest of the class:-)"2406	10246	Welcome to Creative Computing 2011!	7/28/11 6:55	I am also interested in programing Lego Mindstorms.  We might be able to get a group together on the independent work afternoon.  I look forward to working with you.2407	10246	Welcome to Creative Computing 2011!	7/28/11 7:13	"Kathie, I definitely want to share info with you. I taught comp sci as a business department teacher (and I used Scratch and Python) and am now the hs instructional tech specialist as well as business dept chair. I am also working on PD in Scratch for HS teachers."2408	10246	Welcome to Creative Computing 2011!	7/28/11 7:18	"Maria, Have you seen the Harvard CS50: Introduction to Programming and Scratch on the ScratchEd Resources Page? It's a great example of introducing programming."2409	10246	Welcome to Creative Computing 2011!	7/28/11 8:32	I don't know that kids need to be taught how to think creatively. Scratch allows them to express their creative thinking in ways that were not possible before though. Along the way they will learn about logic and problem decomposition.2410	10246	Welcome to Creative Computing 2011!	7/28/11 8:37	"Joanne, It's nice to see another elementary teacher.  So often, things like this are thought to be for middle school and up.  We've used Scratch a little with our elementary students in Suffern, NY and they pick it up so fast.  I look forward to getting some great ideas for our little guys."2411	10246	Welcome to Creative Computing 2011!	7/28/11 8:39	Eric I think it's great that you want to share Scratch with your students. Elementary students will love it!2412	10246	Welcome to Creative Computing 2011!	7/28/11 8:42	"Scratch can be another vehicle for demonstrating what you have learned, like presentations or a word processing document (see http://cast.org/udl/index.htmll). The problem is where should the student learn it? Where do they learn word processing or presentations? Do you have the time to teach Scratch in an ELA course? Or do you collaborate with other teachers to have cross-curricular projects?"2413	10246	Welcome to Creative Computing 2011!	7/28/11 8:42	"Larry, I was not familiar with the PicBoard.  Thanks for mentioning it!  I've already learned something new. Sandi"2414	10246	Welcome to Creative Computing 2011!	7/28/11 8:45	I completely agree with you Gilberto.  I have found the best way to learn is to collaborate with others and discuss different ways to educate2415	10246	Welcome to Creative Computing 2011!	7/28/11 8:46	I'm very interested in hearing about your idea...my school has an advisory period built into the schedule (7/8 grade) and I want to make the time COUNT.2416	10246	Welcome to Creative Computing 2011!	7/28/11 8:48	"This year I am revamping the entire elementary school technology curriculum K-5 and training new staff, so I would love to connect with you on this. I am more familiar with middle/high school."2417	10246	Welcome to Creative Computing 2011!	7/28/11 8:48	Elizabeth - I am also interested in Scratch projects for elementary students!  This will be a good way for us to network with other educators.  ~Andrea2418	10246	Welcome to Creative Computing 2011!	7/28/11 8:49	"Hector, I teach a computer programming course using java and I transformed the course into a video game design course (2D design of course).  I found a great book that helps me accomplish this.  By the end of the school year, kids are making Pac-man, pong, Tetris, etc.  We should meet this week and I can show you the book."2419	10246	Welcome to Creative Computing 2011!	7/28/11 8:49	"Ernest, Your project is intriguing ""Goal Setting and Self-Esteem"" with elementary school. I would be interested in how you would incorporate Scratch. Would you use social interaction behaviors (facial queues, body language, etc)? Thanks, Eleanor"2420	10246	Welcome to Creative Computing 2011!	7/28/11 8:49	"Although I teach CS, I am also interested in combining art work with Scratch. I think it would be a great way to get non-techy kids (especially girls) interested in computing and its possibilities."2421	10246	Welcome to Creative Computing 2011!	7/28/11 8:50	"I introduced Scratch to a 6 grade computer explorer class. Our classes are not leveled either so about a quarter of the class was on an Ed Plan if you want some ideas, I would be happy to discuss. (although, I only just started in the 4th quarter)."2422	10246	Welcome to Creative Computing 2011!	7/28/11 8:50	"I would love to try the Pico Board too, possibly write a grant."2423	10246	Welcome to Creative Computing 2011!	7/28/11 8:52	I teach 7th thru 10th grades. I am hoping to use Scratch to teach programming concepts. I'm looking for any kind of curriculium/lesson plans.2424	10246	Welcome to Creative Computing 2011!	7/28/11 8:52	You are too humble. My expectations for you are high!2425	10246	Welcome to Creative Computing 2011!	7/28/11 8:52	"Patrice, This is what I would like to do too and also get the 7th and 8th grade students and teachers at my school to use Scratch rather than just PowerPoint for their projects in the core curriculum areas."2426	10246	Welcome to Creative Computing 2011!	7/28/11 8:53	I agree with you. I am always looking for new ideas to increase the types of projects to have my students create.2427	10246	Welcome to Creative Computing 2011!	7/28/11 8:56	"When I used this with my grade 5 inclusion class, it was an opportunity for my kids on IEP's with reading and language disabilities to shine. One girl, who is on the very low end of the spectrum for comprehension, etc. and would fade away into the background if I let her, was the star who was the go to person for the other students. Does Robert Gardner have a new intelligence for Technology?"2428	10246	Welcome to Creative Computing 2011!	7/28/11 8:59	"Debbie, Scratch is very new to me and I too would like to learn more about the Music components in Sratch."2429	10246	Welcome to Creative Computing 2011!	7/28/11 9:00	"Have you seen Scratch tutorials? Scratch provides great video tutorials that you can use with your students, as you learn together."2430	10246	Welcome to Creative Computing 2011!	7/28/11 9:00	@ Larry and Sarah....what is a PicoBoard? I am going to have to look that up.2431	10246	Welcome to Creative Computing 2011!	7/28/11 9:02	I didn't know that was possible! I started using Lego Mindstorms last year and would love to talk to you about this.2432	10246	Welcome to Creative Computing 2011!	7/28/11 9:03	"Joanne, Sarah and Sandi-- I'm also an elementary teacher (2/3 multi-age) and look forward to talking with you and others about using Scratch with our students. Larry"2433	10246	Welcome to Creative Computing 2011!	7/28/11 9:03	"Hi Gilberto, I want to do the same as you. Last year I asked teachers what they were doing in class so that I could incorporate their lessons into my technology classes. I wanted to specifically use Scratch for the 3rd grade and I couldn't figure out what to do? So I hope to get ideas as well as resources to find them. Good Luck"2434	10246	Welcome to Creative Computing 2011!	7/28/11 9:03	"Have you read Gardner's latest, ""Five Minds for the Future?"" His ""Creative"" and ""Synthesizing"" minds are definitely exercised with Scratch."2435	10246	Welcome to Creative Computing 2011!	7/28/11 9:04	The actual teaching of the program only has to really happen once. I have done it as part of a final project for a unit. I do the same for Powerpoint and all the other programs we use. Just embed the teaching of the program into the schedule of the unit plan.2436	10246	Welcome to Creative Computing 2011!	7/28/11 9:05	"Exactly, hearing what others are creating, will most likely trigger some of my own ideas."2437	10246	Welcome to Creative Computing 2011!	7/28/11 9:05	"There is no doubt that kids start out with incredible curiosity about the world and a desire to experiment and try new things. But I think that everyone (from early childhood through adult) needs to continue to develop their capacity for creative thinking and expression. I think we can all learn to become more creative thinkers -- and, as you note, develop new ways to express ourselves creatively."2438	10246	Welcome to Creative Computing 2011!	7/28/11 9:06	"Sarah, a colleague at my elementary school came to this workshop last year.  She's a tech teacher and after taking this class she decided that the projects she was doing to support the classroom curriculum using PowerPoint were going to change.  Now most of those projects are done through Scratch. Debbie"2439	10246	Welcome to Creative Computing 2011!	7/28/11 9:06	Thank you Janet!2440	10246	Welcome to Creative Computing 2011!	7/28/11 9:06	"Janet, It will be great to meet you and discuss our fields - it sounds like we are mirror images - business and instructional tech specialist!  Let's make sure we find each other! Kathie"2441	10246	Welcome to Creative Computing 2011!	7/28/11 9:06	"Hi Joanne, I teach technology and have used Scratch with grades 3 - 8 and find that it's not too difficult for the lower grades and still challenging for the older students. I as well am looking forward to getting ideas from others."2442	10246	Welcome to Creative Computing 2011!	7/28/11 9:06	"Hi Christian, I am hoping to further expand Scratch in our district technology curriculum and hopefully use it to integrate curriculum from science and social studies.  Specifically, for elementary school children."2443	10246	Welcome to Creative Computing 2011!	7/28/11 9:06	"Hi Christian, I am hoping to further expand Scratch in our district technology curriculum and hopefully use it to integrate curriculum from science and social studies.  Specifically, for elementary school children."2444	10246	Welcome to Creative Computing 2011!	7/28/11 9:07	"Eleanor, I'll definately seek you out. As a newbie, I'd love to see more of the possibilities of teaching and using Scratch to reinforce the grade level curricula. It's so important to engage the students and ""sneak"" in the learning."2445	10246	Welcome to Creative Computing 2011!	7/28/11 9:07	"Hi, Janet, Our school will also be re-writing curriculum for the middle school and high school CS classes.  I am hoping to be able to build Scratch into the new curriculum.   Best of luck with your curriculum re-write. Mayra"2446	10246	Welcome to Creative Computing 2011!	7/28/11 9:08	It would be great to see the project you develop.  We like to start the elementary projects in scratch so the middle school students can build on their early skills. I have been trying to work with our art teacher to develop a cool art based project for our elem students.2447	10246	Welcome to Creative Computing 2011!	7/28/11 9:11	"Scratch is perfect for 8th graders. I only meet with my 7th & 8th grade computer students once a week, so I'd like to introduce a basic lesson and hope that they continue the work outside of class. Maybe we could revisit ongoing projects throughout the year. I think more opportunity may be in our after school media club. By sharing our projects online, students can access our samples, and then take it where they want."2448	10246	Welcome to Creative Computing 2011!	7/28/11 9:44	"I am not a math teacher, but I share your goals related to thinking skills.  I wonder how you will make students aware of the connections to math.  I also share your goal in having more skill in Scratch on my own.  I am certainly comfortable to not know everything and let students discover answers to their own questions independently, but I still feel I need to have enough background and skill to be a resource for my students.  -Jennifer"2449	10246	Welcome to Creative Computing 2011!	7/28/11 11:12	"I have been trying for a while to incorporate what the classroom teachers are doing in there classes into my technology class, I have had some success, but more with the students than the teachers.  I would love to hear what luck other teachers have had using scratch in coporation with core subjects."2450	10246	Welcome to Creative Computing 2011!	7/28/11 11:13	Wouldn't that be wonderful!  Some how we need to convince them that PowerPoint is not the only way to do things!2451	10246	Welcome to Creative Computing 2011!	7/28/11 11:53	"Hi Joanne. I would love to be able to do a collaborative project with my school's art teacher, so I would be interested in finding out what type of projects you are working on,"2540	10246	Welcome to Creative Computing 2011!	7/30/11 8:29	"Now that we're on the last day...has this idea become clearer to you?  If so, what do you have in mind?"2452	10269	"Creative Computing 2011 - Your ""Dance Party"" project creation experience"	7/28/11 13:25	"In the Flash Mob project  I wanted to have multiple characters but I wanted them to use the same script. Except for the move to their starting positions, their scripts are the same. I was able to test out one sprite, duplicate it, and then just change it's colors and it's starting position."2453	10269	"Creative Computing 2011 - Your ""Dance Party"" project creation experience"	7/28/11 13:30	"For the dance project, I chose to use two sprites that had multiple poses. I wanted to explore combining the poses to make realistic dance moves. I used the ballerina and played with gravity to have her jump and land gracefully. I used the boy dancer and made him attempt a moonwalk. I got stuck on moving the boy convincingly. Next I would like to record one dancers moves and have another imitate it (like our bossy/bossed exercise)."2454	10269	"Creative Computing 2011 - Your ""Dance Party"" project creation experience"	7/28/11 13:33	"In the Dance Party project, I had a dance contest. Each contestant was identified by A, B or C. The project required the user to press one of the letters to make the contestant dance on the stage.  I used the x/y coordinates to glide the sprite from the original postion to the stage to dance then return to their original position. The contest moderator stated the directions to the audience. A challenge that I had, and still have, I want the sprite to grow when it is on the stage, then return to original size when it returns to original starting position. My challenge is that I don't want the sprite to get too big."2455	10269	"Creative Computing 2011 - Your ""Dance Party"" project creation experience"	7/28/11 13:34	"I also created a flash mob scene, each script was the same but I changed the ""wait"" period on each of them.  After I finished it, my neighbor shared with me that it would have been easier to to use ""broadcast"" tiles.  I learned something new!  :-)"2456	10269	"Creative Computing 2011 - Your ""Dance Party"" project creation experience"	7/28/11 13:35	For this project I created a simple scenario of a ballerina jumping and gliding in a ballet studio.  Next I would like to add several sprites and choreograph a ballet sequence.2457	10269	"Creative Computing 2011 - Your ""Dance Party"" project creation experience"	7/28/11 13:35	"At first I was thinking of a specific piece of music that I thought would need sort of an African scene.  Since I didn't find something satisfactory in the library, I ended up using a desert scene and changed the song to ""Summertime"" sung by Billie Holiday.  My sprite was a grasshopper in the desert and my biggest challenge was timing him to jump at the point in the music where ""fish are jumpin'"" happens.  This happened during the instrumental introduction and my plan was/is to change to a water scene with fish jumping (using mulitple sprites) when the actual lyrics came in."2458	10269	"Creative Computing 2011 - Your ""Dance Party"" project creation experience"	7/28/11 13:37	"In my dance party project I wanted to have two sprites dancing alongside one another.  I got stuck quite a bit. Learning some of the basics such initial variables and switching backgrounds was important. If I were to add onto this project or do it again, I would have the sprites interact more, perhaps in a dance battle rather than simultaneously.  I think using the Broadcast command would allow me to do this."2459	10269	"Creative Computing 2011 - Your ""Dance Party"" project creation experience"	7/28/11 13:37	"What are you most proud of? What will you do next with your project? I did the Dancing Lobster project. I am proud of successfully controling size and location of the lobster sprite. In particular, setting Initial Conditions. Next, I want to change the one red lobster dancing to a chorus line of lobsters (maybe different colors) dancing."2460	10269	"Creative Computing 2011 - Your ""Dance Party"" project creation experience"	7/28/11 13:37	"I am currently collaborating on a project to introduce the power of Scratch to both teachers and students.  The inspiration for the project came from the idea of forming a computer science advocacy group (using Scratch). I just started the project, so I am still in the design stage of the program.  But I did get the curtains to open up! What I hope to do, is to have words scrawl up on the stage, explain the importance of Scratch and then demonstrate different math skills via the use of manipulatives.... And then who knows. I am finding talking and sharing with other teachers at the workshop to be very inspirational (and at times a tad bit intimidating :) )"2461	10269	"Creative Computing 2011 - Your ""Dance Party"" project creation experience"	7/28/11 13:38	My project was to animate some photos of the swivel chairs we are sitting on.  I am fairly new to Scratch so I got stuck on keeping the sprites where I wanted them to be.  My neighbor was very patient and helpful with my questions.  I learned a lot from her.  Next I would like to trim the music file I have to fit the short animation.  I was inspired by watching the shared animations from the group.2462	10269	"Creative Computing 2011 - Your ""Dance Party"" project creation experience"	7/28/11 13:38	"The inspiration for my project was our location.  Looking at the city and the river reminded me of the song Dirty Water. One obstacle I occurred was finding the song and then downloading it.  Once that was done and it was attached to the stage, I found that it was much too long (3 minutes).  I then had to find an editor, free of course, that would allow me to edit the song to a shorter length. With the new shorter version of the song in place, I then had to readjust the number of “repeats” for each of my sprites so that everything ended at once. This type of project is one that I can see using in my classroom next year."2463	10269	"Creative Computing 2011 - Your ""Dance Party"" project creation experience"	7/28/11 13:39	"For my dance project, I wanted to attempt to draw someone and try to animate a dance move. Since I can't draw, I made a stick figure, but was successful in creating an animation. I initially got stuck on creating another sprite in a different position, but got help from a neighbor on how to use costumes. I wanted to try and synchronize the movements with the music. I was able to do that playing with the wait times between costume changes. Finally, a neighbor suggested I use broadcast to synch the start of the second peice of music between my two sprites. That worked great! Thanks!"2464	10269	"Creative Computing 2011 - Your ""Dance Party"" project creation experience"	7/28/11 13:40	"For my dance project, I did a standard one sprite dance sequence. What I found difficult was making my code more concise. The script window gets cluttered pretty quickly. I tried to use the broadcast and receive feature as a way to create subroutines so I could partition sections of code in a more manageable way. I also had to remember to initialize several attributes of the scene and sprite at the start of the program."2465	10269	"Creative Computing 2011 - Your ""Dance Party"" project creation experience"	7/28/11 13:40	"I am currently building a pong game and I am stuck on bouncing the ball.  This is the most complex component of pong.  Once this is complete, I can add the other features (such as points, player names, animation, etc). Another question I can answer is my inspiration for pong.  When I first started programming in 1996, my professor in college gave us a homework assignment (that's right...I said a homework assignment) to create a fully functional pong using the java programming environment.  I spent approximate 20-30 hours coding and making my pong game.  It looked horrible, but it worked. Thus, I feel that it would be poetic to create a new pong game, with nicer features using scratch."2466	10269	"Creative Computing 2011 - Your ""Dance Party"" project creation experience"	7/28/11 13:40	"In my dance project, I wanted the 2nd character to appear later (about 15 seconds in). I couldn't figure out how to have char2 come into the picture. I learned to use hide and show commands as well as BROADCAST. The broadcast command was with char1. For example, char2 'shows' when char1 asks 'who?' Char2 has to RECEIVE the command. It really makes you think about every little detail, the order of operations, and the logic of 'if' this, 'then' that."2467	10269	"Creative Computing 2011 - Your ""Dance Party"" project creation experience"	7/28/11 13:40	"In ELD Dance Party, I got my background inspiration from looking out the window and seeing  the water of the Charles River with boats sailing by.  I decided to make my dance party on the beach.  I wanted to have a boy and girl sprite that each had multiple costumes that I could utilize.  I am challenged by getting the sound to work exactly as I would like. I wanted each dancer to have their own music to move by but I'm still haven't gotten it to perform as I would like."2468	10269	"Creative Computing 2011 - Your ""Dance Party"" project creation experience"	7/28/11 13:41	"For the dance project I didn' t want a program that people simply watched, but I wanted them to interact with it and have the program respond to their action. I found an existing program sample in Scratch called ""Ocean Music Box"" which had this sort of interaction. I used that program to create a dance project where the sprites can be moved on the screen by the user. The music changes depending on where on the screen the sprites are placed.  I then started working on a new project that uses the pens and would like to incorporate the interactie drawing and the music into one program eventually."2469	10269	"Creative Computing 2011 - Your ""Dance Party"" project creation experience"	7/28/11 13:42	"For my dance project I was trying to recreate the ""Zorba the Greek"" dance. I spent most of my time downloading a program so I could get the music off youtube. When I finally did that, I was able to import the music. If I had more time I would have probably created my own characters with multiple costumes, but I worked with one of the available sprites. I learned how to edit and reflect a sprite so that he could dance in different ways. I then wanted to add in another person and have them holding hands and dancing, but I didn't have time to make the second sprite pose the same. So I was able to accomplish about 1/2 of what I set out to do. I did learn a bunch of new things in the art session!"2470	10269	"Creative Computing 2011 - Your ""Dance Party"" project creation experience"	7/28/11 13:43	"Interactive Boston Skyline Xylophone What was your inspiration for this project? I was impressed yesterday by the view out of our conference room. This morning we were asked to think about Arts-related ideas. Seemed fun to take the image of the skyline and art-ify or music-ify it. How did you do that? (about a particular aspect of the project) I experimented with several ways of triggering the music. In both cases, the taller buildings in the skyline photo are the ""keys"" of a keyboard. My original intent was to have some type of controllable graphic ""pointer"" slide left and right across the buildings (using a PicoBoard). I got a bit stuck at first, so tried an easier version triggered by the mouse pointer. The ""if"" and ""touching _______"" blocks were important to make this work. What did you get stuck on? The PicoBoard version still has some bugs. When the pointer-ball is rolled over a building, it is not triggering a musical note. What are you most proud of? I had a goal to try using the PicoBoard, so this was one attempt. What will you do next with your project? Try to get it working. Ask for some feedback from one of the music educators here. (Who are you again?)"2471	10269	"Creative Computing 2011 - Your ""Dance Party"" project creation experience"	7/28/11 13:43	My neighbor was also helpful in showing me about broadcast!2472	10269	"Creative Computing 2011 - Your ""Dance Party"" project creation experience"	7/28/11 13:50	What are you most proud of? It bothered me how static the sprites looked as I moved them.  I heard someone at another table say something about changing an arm on a sprite and that started me exploring possibilities.  With the help of people at my table (thanks all) I was able to make the dog's ears pop up as he jumped then down again when he dropped back (via a costume change).  Ahhhhh....the endless possibilities! Which brings up a big issue:  I'm a content teacher and somehow I need to keep students' focus on the key content goal of any Scratch projects.  I'm thinking collaboration with the art teacher or other specialists might be a way to deal with this issue.2473	10269	"Creative Computing 2011 - Your ""Dance Party"" project creation experience"	7/28/11 13:49	"My inspiration for my dance project was realistic dance movement in a MTV video style environment.  The project was completed by using two main spriets dancing with a consistently changing background. My biggest challenge was getting the dancers to move in a realistic fashion and this was a matter of coordinating the timing, changing of costumes, and waits. I'm most proud that I was able to accomplish the dance movements somewhat realistically. I wish to continue the dance project. (I actually wrote ""Dance Project"" in my porject ideas this morning). I like the flash mob creation. I want to create sprites and coodinate the movements of the sprites in non dance related environment. The challenge here so far is creating the sprites. At first I thought to create in Photoshop but thought that I should try to create using a medium that my students will have access to. So, I 'm trying to create sprites in Scratch."2474	10269	"Creative Computing 2011 - Your ""Dance Party"" project creation experience"	7/28/11 13:44	"I think my next step is to learn how to remix using how other projects; I'm inspired by what others have done so far using Scratch in the timing of different kinds of motion.  Sadly, yesterday was my first day actually using the application and so as I'm learning more about the higher level functions - I'm curious on what I can do next.  I really want to explore operators, variables, and pen to develop animations or game projects.  The duplication of scripts with other sprites helped me with my beach dance party project. I spent the late part of the morning looking through the projects in the ScratchEd resources area for ideas and its really cool to see the curricular connections.  Besides the fact that Scratch enhances computational thinking - I'm always trying to make the connections to different subject areas."2475	10269	"Creative Computing 2011 - Your ""Dance Party"" project creation experience"	7/28/11 13:44	"I wanted one dancer to do specific moves. Chose the sprite then made 8 costumes by copying,,,editing...and mirror imaging. Worked harder than I had to by not doing those steps in a logical order so I had to make a table to keep track of the moves. Then John presented his project and demo'd the random costume. My ""control-freak"" tendencies were dashed! (I copied the project and changed it to random...looked just as good.) Got stuck on positioning the sprite and making him stay put. Set X works wonders.  I also didn't pick up on the distinction between the costume number and costume name i.e. costume # 1 is dan2. Favorite thing I learned today was the duplicate stamp."2476	10269	"Creative Computing 2011 - Your ""Dance Party"" project creation experience"	7/28/11 13:45	"What was your inspiration for this project? I wanted to do something different - Never had uploaded a song, wanted two things to do something simultaneously, and I wanted some random aspect. Also, I like jungles and monkeys. How did you do that? (about a particular aspect of the project) Found my song on google, downloaded it and uploaded to my project. What did you get stuck on? My song sounded ok off of my desktop but lousy on Scratch. For some reason though, it sounded fine when I uploaded it to the Scratch site. What will you do next with your project? After walking around the room, I am inspired to use pen and sound more. I want to create a Scratch that has the user choose an instrument and then somehow write their name and each letter or position creates a different note. When played, that is what your name sounds like. We'll see..."2477	10269	"Creative Computing 2011 - Your ""Dance Party"" project creation experience"	7/28/11 23:52	What was the inspiration for this project? daning queen & dancing quees2 Just before attending this workshop I ran through the Scratch Tutorials  on the homepage. Along with the themed inspirations of the sessions I added/remix-ed  my  own projects from the ones  created from the tutorials. What are you most proud of...? Yesterday I applied what Rivka taught me (using a go to script) to my new project and to assit a colleague.2478	10269	"Creative Computing 2011 - Your ""Dance Party"" project creation experience"	7/28/11 13:45	The inspiration was to use a number of different sprites on a background.  Each sprite would do something different and maybe interact in some fashion. I got stuck when I started using a sprite which already had scripts insluded.  I thought changing them would be easier than starting from the beginning.  It did work for 1 sprite but was more complicated for the 2nd one.  I learned a lot fixing the 2nd one.  I was proud that I was able to find a way to keep one away from the other by moving sprite 1 to another part of the screen when they got too close.  The next time I will add a 3rd sprite.2479	10269	"Creative Computing 2011 - Your ""Dance Party"" project creation experience"	7/28/11 13:47	"I uploaded my party project. My inspiration for the project was this morning's class demo (I have no previous Scratch experience). I added 4 sprites to a Stage that used the Spotlight-stage as the background.  For each sprite, I included multiple customes to be able to make them dance.  I then set the stage to play music and to broadcast a start message when the space key was pressed.  Each sprite would dance and then broadcast a message for the next sprite.  To the stage, I added the ""when the m key is pressed"" stop all. I was stuck in getting the broadcasting to work correctly for a while. To get it to work, I used a variable as a switch. I am most proud of getting it to work ""just the way that I wanted"" I would like to be able to import my own sound file and also have a message on the stage that instructs the user on using the enter and m keys.   I would like the message to then disappear. This was great fun and I can't wait to use it with the kids!!"2480	10269	"Creative Computing 2011 - Your ""Dance Party"" project creation experience"	7/28/11 13:48	"I wanted to create an interactive dance presentation where the user selected a series of steps simply pressing a key.  The hope is that once you have a multiple of steps saved, then you can make the character dance to any song.  That is future direction of this project."2481	10269	"Creative Computing 2011 - Your ""Dance Party"" project creation experience"	7/28/11 13:49	"Inspiration In my dancing project, I wanted to incorporate multiple spinning sprites. I decided to take a picture of my friend, crop the picture, and make a sprite out of his head.  I then duplicated his his head several times. I placed the sprites in the corners of the project and had them spin into each other. The four sprites came together and created a stick figure that had my friend's head. Then the stick figure began to dance. What are you most proud of? I have been trying to use variables in prior projects but had no success. In this project, I was able to successful incorporate a variable count that allowed me to make all the heads (sprites) disappear at a specifically designed point in the animation. I did not have to rely on timing, which made the animation go much smoother."2482	10269	"Creative Computing 2011 - Your ""Dance Party"" project creation experience"	7/28/11 13:56	"I really had no inspiration.  I just wanted something that was going to be fun, maybe to ""hook kids"" into the possibilities when using scratch.  Flashy colors, cool music are ways to get kids excited about something new. I got stuck trying to sequence random costumes I'm proud of how I was able to make the sequence entertaining I want to do a project on playing or listening to music notes."2483	10269	"Creative Computing 2011 - Your ""Dance Party"" project creation experience"	7/28/11 14:00	"My inspiration for the dance project was gardening.  This idea came from the trading cards from the first evening and was provoked by browsing the background images in Scratch.  I was surprised that there were no flower images, so I had to find one online (I didn't spend much time on this task).  I was interested in learning how to make Scratch communicate between objects (broadcast and receive)."2484	10269	"Creative Computing 2011 - Your ""Dance Party"" project creation experience"	7/28/11 13:57	Dance Party was fun and it was great to have the group to help with issues that they were struggling with and for others to give me ideas.2485	10269	"Creative Computing 2011 - Your ""Dance Party"" project creation experience"	7/28/11 14:19	"My requirements: I wanted my sprites to do different kinds of dance moves. What I did: To do this, I chose different sprites and used the different costumes for each sprite. I got stuck on using the thinking bubbles and orienting the bubble to show up where I want it to. Next, I will make my sprites move as they do the dance moves."2486	10269	"Creative Computing 2011 - Your ""Dance Party"" project creation experience"	7/28/11 15:57	The last project that i worked on was the dance party project. I love the idea that it takes two people to dance. I remember the block parties that we had as i was growing up. This project reminded me of thoes days.2487	10269	"Creative Computing 2011 - Your ""Dance Party"" project creation experience"	7/28/11 16:38	"The about me project What was your inspiration for this project? Me, I am amazing. jk. How did you do that? (about a particular aspect of the project) The loudness variable reads your scream/noise and broadcasts a variable when the loudness condition has been met. What did you get stuck on? Having the broadcast variable for each shoe hide/show the appropriate images given the coordinate of the mouse click. I did not know Scratch could read which Sprite was clicked. What are you most proud of? That it is a bit interactive and makes you scream. Also, that almost every image is from my library of pictures and makes it unique."2488	10269	"Creative Computing 2011 - Your ""Dance Party"" project creation experience"	7/29/11 7:12	"That is a big issue. I will be introducing Scratch to content teachers in the fall and I know they will have the same concerns. But, you wrote that you were bothered until you figured out how to customize your sprite and the students will be too if they don't get time to learn that as well. One suggestion, since they can download Scratch to their home computer you can leave the customizing to home time and work on the subject content in school."2489	10269	"Creative Computing 2011 - Your ""Dance Party"" project creation experience"	7/29/11 7:19	"I think using a variable countdown for this project is great. You could make it interactive by asking the program user how long should each sprite dance and then assigning the answer to your variable. Play with variable sliders too,"2490	10269	"Creative Computing 2011 - Your ""Dance Party"" project creation experience"	7/29/11 7:20	Great idea. It could definitely work.2536	10269	"Creative Computing 2011 - Your ""Dance Party"" project creation experience"	7/29/11 14:43	I wanted to design a game program that was challenging and interesting to create. I had trouble with some sequencing ( having things happen at the right time) and also I used the Green flag as a way to play the game again which was not a good idea because I couldn't figure out if the program was running for the first time (need to initialize the high score) or if it was just another attempt (keep the high score). I ended up using the space bar to signal another attempt. I want to add the ability to have multiple players and add difficulty levels.2543	10269	"Creative Computing 2011 - Your ""Dance Party"" project creation experience"	7/30/11 8:48	I was a new user of scratch and had to get my head around designing a project. I went with the notion of making two stick people and building on the two original figures by copying and pasting them to form a party. I then began to add faces with different colors. I found the process to be confusing at first but with help from my fellow teachers I finished the project.2546	10269	"Creative Computing 2011 - Your ""Dance Party"" project creation experience"	7/30/11 9:01	"I was making a scratch to introduce my self to the group. It seemed a bit boring having a sprite narrate the story so, dancing seemed a perfect fit. I got a few laughs and it made it more memorable. It was lots of fun making it with a dancing element."2550	10272	Creative Computing 2011 - Storytelling strategies	7/30/11 9:11	"Thanks, this something I can use."2559	10272	Creative Computing 2011 - Storytelling strategies	7/30/11 9:32	I've enjoyed reading the comments from the Creative Computing Workshop 2011.  Sometimes groups of students will work on Scratch projects that they want to connect with other student projects.  There are some examples of this on the Clutter link http://clutter.scratch.mit.edu/2491	10275	Creative Computing 2011 - Mid-point review	7/29/11 8:35	I'm still looking for something in the way of curriculium/lesson plans/projects that I can use to get started in the fall. Additional goal is to build up contacts of others to share stuff with.2492	10275	Creative Computing 2011 - Mid-point review	7/29/11 8:40	"The Creative Computing Workshop has been everything that was expected and more to this point. I've learned how to employ several features in Scratch that I was not even aware of to this point. Moreover, I've generated ideas of how I might use these to assist students. The hands-on approach to the workshop has been extremely influential in generating ideas to use in the classroom as well as in professional development workshops. They have also provided great approaching to teaching and learning Scratch. New goals have emerged because of the workshop. With the New Jersey Core Curriculum Content Standards set to change in September 2012. I see a clear opportunity to utilize Scratch in achieving new objectives outlined by the state. These goals cannot be fulfilled before the end of the workshop but are certainly worthwhile."2493	10275	Creative Computing 2011 - Mid-point review	7/29/11 8:41	"I feel that I have completely achieved my goal thus far.  I wanted to become more familiar with Scratch so I could provide professional development for my school district.  I am sure there is so much more to learn, but I feel that I have a good foundation to build upon.  The only thing I might be lacking is more ideas on how to incorporate scratch into other disciplines other than math & computer science. I would really love to learn how to make backgrounds scroll so I could help students create more interactive projects."2494	10275	Creative Computing 2011 - Mid-point review	7/29/11 8:41	"The most useful thing I have learned so far is the ""broadcast"" block.  This opens up a whole new set of ideas for me that I can use in my class.  This was my primary goal in taking this course. New goals have not really emerged for me.  I would be nice if we can do something with a pico board."2495	10275	Creative Computing 2011 - Mid-point review	7/29/11 8:42	"A big goal was to get better at Scratch and I do feel stronger.  There is functionality I haven't worked with yet...specifically in the operating and variable blocks.  I need to use them before end of course. I hope to feel clearer about how to incorporate Scratch into a non-technology course (math).  I'm thinking it might be fun to do some problem posing through a Scratch project...might catch their attention.  Also, I hope to use Scratch (if I can get computer lab or cart) the first week of school to develop the habits I want to refer to all year.  Would love a conversation about ways to collaborate with tech staff so some of the early learning takes place outside the content class..."2496	10275	Creative Computing 2011 - Mid-point review	7/29/11 8:47	I have been able to meet people with the same focus as myself who do things differently. I have learned of other approaches to teaching programming that I can try.2497	10275	Creative Computing 2011 - Mid-point review	7/29/11 8:48	"I have already met my goal, to learn more about Scracth and learn some new strategies for getting young people excited about computing. All the activities we've done so far are ones I can use with my students and campers. Now I am looking forward to learning more about integrating art with Scratch and playing with the effects. I would also be really interested in playing with the Pico boards and Lego, integrating Scratch with external devices."2498	10275	Creative Computing 2011 - Mid-point review	7/29/11 8:55	"My original goal was to gain confidence in using Scratch, thus allowing me to work with students and teachers back home. I have made progress in terms of learning more and feeling comfortable in the program. However, I am still looking forward to more Scratch time :) The introduction to each activity has been very helpful for me. I have learned to watch the demos carefully, try new things, and ask questions. One project I loved was the partner/switch work. We started a story, moved over to another, and finished with a third. Very cool idea, lots of benefits. My new goal is to create more than animation. I want to learn how to make my work interactive. Perhaps a game. Maybe today. And gee, maybe I'll think about getting/using a Picoboard like Larry :)"2499	10275	Creative Computing 2011 - Mid-point review	7/29/11 8:55	I feel like I have accomplished my goal.  I am not very comfortable with programming but this gave me an opportunity to dive in and become more familiar with the language and tools.2500	10275	Creative Computing 2011 - Mid-point review	7/29/11 8:55	I think my initial goals have been met. I think I can integrate Scratch into my curriculum in a way that will interest students. My new goal will be to see how I can get Scratch to work with Lego robotics kits.2501	10275	Creative Computing 2011 - Mid-point review	7/29/11 8:55	"One goal was to interact with many different people and share our teaching ideas and experiences. I have truly enjoyed doing that. The shared story activity really helped with that. It's awsome that we have our discussion link so we can continue exchanging ideas with each other. My other goal, (more lofty) is to develop some concrete plans for professional development. I have two ideas I want to work on: 1) to have a workshop (or playshop) in which teachers are encouraged to bring their own children regardless of age and my programming students help me facilitate the experience. My students are already eager to do this with me. I need to get a structure to it. 2) based on what was suggested last night, I wnat to create a project that truly meets our school wide technology standard."2502	10275	Creative Computing 2011 - Mid-point review	7/29/11 8:56	I've definitely got some materials I can use in my classroom now. The ScratchEd website is a great resource.Thanks for the cards. I've learned a lot about using Scratch through you and my peers. I hope to continue learning more about using Scratch as we continue. Thanks for the opportunity!2503	10275	Creative Computing 2011 - Mid-point review	7/29/11 8:58	"I like the term ""playshop."""2504	10275	Creative Computing 2011 - Mid-point review	7/29/11 8:59	I have progressed towards my goals so far - I've learned quite a few new elements of Scratch that open up new possibilities for me.  My goal for the remainder of the session is to collaborate with my colleagues in designing a unit for our 3rd grade.2505	10275	Creative Computing 2011 - Mid-point review	7/29/11 9:00	"I have definitely become more knowledgeable about Scratch,  I have learned so much about different programming aspects. I like the broadcast function.  I haven't tried the operators yet and I would like to think of more uses for the pen.  I have found the collaboration to be very helpful and inspiring. I am still looking to get more ideas for projects for elementary age kids and how to put together some simple lesson plans."2506	10275	Creative Computing 2011 - Mid-point review	7/29/11 9:01	"One of my goals was to have an opportunity to interact with other professionals to learn different activities to use with Scratch.  I have learned a great deal up to this point and I plan to continue connecting today and tomorrow. Even though I have been using Scratch in my classroom already, I have learned many new techniques that I wasn't aware of!  Thank you!"2507	10275	Creative Computing 2011 - Mid-point review	7/29/11 9:01	"I came here to be inspired while I create an entire new K-5 technology curriculum for my district. I am definitely inspired. I am really excited for the breakout sessions as a group of us have been discussing talking about using the WeDo, Mindstorms etc... opening up an entire new world for me."2508	10275	Creative Computing 2011 - Mid-point review	7/29/11 9:01	"I've definitely deepened my knowledge of the ""workings"" of Scratch through the collaboration and sharing activities.  Beyond that, and perhaps more importantly, I've gotten some terrific ideas for how to embed Scratch into curriculum in meaningful ways AND I've seen some great examples of lessons/activities/ I can do to introduce Computational Thinking to my students.  I feel like I'm definitely on my way to achieving the goals I set the first day. I'm not sure if I can consider this a ""new goal"" or not, but I've changed my perspective on how I think Scratch should be used.  I think I was struggling with the idea of creating projects that were open-ended enough to allow students to work at their strengths and interests, YET have enough rigor to use as assessment.  Now, I am looking at things differently and realize that I don't have to take on so much of the responsibility and I can focus on the process for assessment and allow students to choose content.  I'm still working through this new thought...and look forward to clarifying it even more over the next few days. Sandi"2509	10275	Creative Computing 2011 - Mid-point review	7/29/11 9:01	"It has been a great workshop! My first goal was meet.  Amazing people doing fantastic work, is what I have seen so far.  One thing I'm taking back into my classroom is the ""role playing"" activity to demonstrate the use of the Broadcast tool.  I can see my students getting into it!"2510	10275	Creative Computing 2011 - Mid-point review	7/29/11 9:03	"My goal was to learn more about scratch so I would be able to re-work some projects that we have curriculum projects in microworlds, so our older students have an opportunity to become more experienced in scratch.  The chance to connect with other teachers and learn about their uses and wishes for scratch in their classroom is invaluable. I believe both of these goals are being met."2511	10275	Creative Computing 2011 - Mid-point review	7/29/11 9:09	"I am still working on a personal project that shows students the hurdles that they might encounter in life. The project will show the 3 different ways children and adults approach and handle these  hurdles. I hope to have at least 4 different scenes. There are still a lot of things that I have not used, but that is because I never really used Scratch till this year. I am looking forward to doing more. I feel that i am always trying to catch-up I am teaching this summer and I am anxious to try this out in our summer school/camp for the final weeks of the year. I like the part where I will be able to upload there work as a group."2512	10275	Creative Computing 2011 - Mid-point review	7/29/11 9:04	"Yes John, I agree. The Broadcast & Receive commands are awesome and helpful!"2513	10275	Creative Computing 2011 - Mid-point review	7/29/11 9:04	I'm getting a better feel for Scratch every day and enjoy learning new techniques every day. Collaborative atmosphere is helpful and fun.  Thanks! I wonder how Scratch handles such CS ideas as finding the max value in a list or sorting a list of values2514	10275	Creative Computing 2011 - Mid-point review	7/29/11 9:07	"It's great to have had longer stretches for using Scratch than in the past.  I have a better feel for what it takes to program and this will serve me well in understanding what kids at my school have already been introduced to.  Also, I'm a little more confident in thinking I can better think about integrating into a collaborative project between Art, Tech and Language that already exists.  I'm even thinking about using it in Music class for kids to illustrate form. I would like to learn more about the music portion of Scratch.  From what I've seen so far it doesn't seem intuitive, but I'd love to be proven wrong!"2515	10275	Creative Computing 2011 - Mid-point review	7/29/11 9:06	The workshop has been extremely informative and fun! I found the style of introducing each session with human volunteers to mirror the goals needed to achieve in programming extremely helpful in solidifying the flow of ideas. I came to this workshop with the hope of getting indepth knowledge of Scratch to use with my Middle School students and I find that along with that I am also learning useful techniques on how to guide students through the process of computational thinking. What I need to do next is put some lesson plans in place for the next academic year.2516	10275	Creative Computing 2011 - Mid-point review	7/29/11 9:15	"My goal was to be inspired. I've definitely been exposed to some great ideas that will keep me thinking for a while. I've enjoyed the variety of activities: in addition to the specifically Scratch-focused training, I loved the tour and the panel discussion. I would love to hear Mitch, Karen, Michelle and Amanda describe their visions of ""what schools could/should look like,"" and also learn about innovative or ""model"" schools they they are aware of. I'd like us to think ahead about ways for all of the participants and facilitators to continue to collaborate in the future. One suggestion would be to make it easier to identify workshop participants on the ScratchEd site. I also want to make time to learn and explore possibilities with the PicoBoard. I'll probably do this during the independent project time and/or the game time. I agree that ""broadcast/receive"" are very useful commands. I'd be interested to learn about other commands that I may not yet be familiar with. I'm enjoying the opportunity to be here. Larry"2517	10275	Creative Computing 2011 - Mid-point review	7/29/11 9:09	The modeled learning activities have been helpful in learning both the basics programming steps of Scratch as well as powerful  command like 'broadcast'.  My goal of learning more of the advanced commands (operations and variables) would be helpful. It has been very helpful meeting K-12  teachers from various parts of the country listening to their ideas about using Scratch and education. One new goal is to find out how to 'best' organize a gallery where k-5 students can post work so that it can be viewed or found in quick manner (within a district with multiple schools or within a school with many class sections on a grade level) Your modeling has provided new teaching strategies for me. Thank you.2518	10275	Creative Computing 2011 - Mid-point review	7/29/11 9:10	"Scratch is a tool that I have wanted to spend some time considering and this workshop has perfectly provided time for this endeavor.  I thoroughly enjoy the format of the conference.  The role play activities are all fun, applicable beyond the Scratch classroom, and are highly likely to appear in various places in my courses, club activities and community outreach. One very clear idea has emerged for me.  I would love to offer an afternoon program using Scratch at my daughter's elementary school. Another clear application of Scratch would be for my school's annual bookday.  On bookday the mission is for faculty, students and invited guests to create an array of workshops centered around the themes of a book chosen by a student and faculty committee.  My computer science club is known for devising creative and fun workshops.  In the past the club has used Alice and Greenfoot for example. My curricular goal of deciding whether Scratch is a good fit for our introductory and middle division programs is also being met.  I am convinced Scratch would be a very effective tool and will encourage the members of my department to adopt Scratch."2519	10275	Creative Computing 2011 - Mid-point review	7/29/11 9:11	Two of my initial goals were to become more comfortable with Scratch in general and to develop project ideas & resources.  All of these goals have been met.  I'm feeling really excited about bringing these ideas back to my students.  One of my additional goals is to develop an assessment process for an open-ended scratch project.  I am thinking about how I can bring students into the process of deciding what makes a superior quality scratch project by watching projects on the website and then discussing the projects that really stood out and why.  I do want to have my own ideas as well about what my expectations need to be in terms of learning outcomes as well.2520	10275	Creative Computing 2011 - Mid-point review	7/29/11 9:12	I had a goal of learning enough about Scratch and from other teachers to be able to teach it. I have definitely made a lot of progress on this goal. I'm now hoping to get a pico board to explore the extensions to Scratch.2521	10275	Creative Computing 2011 - Mid-point review	7/29/11 9:12	"In what way(s) have you made progress on these goals? What aspects of the workshop have been helpful? What else do you need to achieve the goals you initially set? By participating in the hands-on activities, I have been able to think of how I will bring them back to my classroom. Last night's panel discussion introduced me to a new software, Tale Blazers, which I hope I will be able to use. Have new goals emerged? That is, are there other things that you haven't done or learned or explored yet that you really want to do before the end of the workshop? I just want to learn more, more, more..... to bring back.  I am trying to develop my course."2522	10275	Creative Computing 2011 - Mid-point review	7/29/11 9:13	"So far I have been pleasantly invigorated by all the sharing that the group members are doing.  My goal was to become more proficient in using Scratch.  Yesterday I sat next to Janet and she is far more advanced and was very helpful (also patient). I have gotten lots of good ideas and strategies for dealing with the introduction of technology into my classes.  As an art teacher I mostly deal with hands on manipulation.  I can see Scratch blending in nicely with combining several of the projects I already use.  For example, making a sprite in Illustrator and then using it in Scratch (Illustrator sets the sprite on a transparent background so it works well with Scratch). I found a fantastic example of a scratch project developed by another person in the ScratchEd site called ""Got Art"".  This person has generated a program that draws!  It is fantastic!"2523	10275	Creative Computing 2011 - Mid-point review	7/29/11 9:13	I have met my goal in that I know that I want to use Scratch in my curriculum for both 8th graders and the Intro to CS course.  I have thoroughly enjoyed learning so much about Scratch in such a short period of time. A second and not expected outcome of the workshop so far is getting ideas for activities to do with my class to introduce lessons.  I really enjoyed the story telling activity and even the way that algorithmic thinking has been play acted in this workshop.  I use role playing in my classroom for concepts such as recursion and sorting and searching.  The workshop has given me additional ideas that I can use for teaching CS in any of my courses. I would like to learn how to make games in Scratch.  I can probably muddle thru it now but I am looking forward to learning how others use Scratch to make games.  My students are very drawn to any language in which they can write games.2524	10275	Creative Computing 2011 - Mid-point review	7/29/11 9:13	"I feel I have meet my goals to learn more about how to introduce Scratch.  There is no easy way and monitoring students and their needs is a way to learn more. A new goal, I realize I need to focus more on of the more difficult progam techniques to add challenging tasks for the go faster students."2525	10275	Creative Computing 2011 - Mid-point review	7/29/11 9:13	"I had imagined this workshop to be strictly focused on Scratch programming and so I came here just hoping to see how I can create activities or games with the students in my school.   However, being introduced to the panelists last night and the tour of the MIT lab has made me think of other kinds of possibilities.  I hope to create a write up of all the resources and ideas that have come out of what I learned these days to folks in my professional learning network (PLN).  I think there's a lot of folks that I know that are doing interesting things in their schools and don't know of the wonderful resources coming from MIT.  So my new goal is not only to work in my school with Scratch and what I've learned here, but to spread the wealth of information with my PLN. One thing I would like to do is to continue the digital conversation of sharing tips, tricks, and scratch programming files."2526	10275	Creative Computing 2011 - Mid-point review	7/29/11 9:15	"My goal was to be able to implement computational thinking and programming into the middle school computer curriculum. I have made progress by being provided with insight on how to use scratch in a more advanced way, as well as ideas for projects and activities. The skits, which I’ve very surprised to admit, were helpful. The skits provided me with ideas on how to illustrate parallelism. No new goals have emerged."2527	10275	Creative Computing 2011 - Mid-point review	7/29/11 9:15	"My goal was to see how Scratch might fit into my third grade engineering initiative. The implications of using Scratch to help teach the engineering design process are obvious. My new goal is to sort out a framework for teaching a trimester-long unit on engineering with Scratch. How do I balance giving enough support to those that need it without stifling those who will thrive from open-ended projects? I'm thinking about starting with the basics of Scratch, perhaps using those flash cards and a simple starter activity. I'll likely incorporate some of the fun lessons demonstrated over the past couple of days (having kids act out commands as sprites!). That could be followed up with some loosely-defined goals, as we did here. i.e. Make a dance party. Then we can move to a culminating project that is much more open-ended. Maybe kids can make proposals for their projects before beginning. That way I can offer guidance for those who do not have a clear goal yet, while staying out of kids' way if they don't need me. Any suggestions would be fantastic... I'd love to hear your ideas."2528	10275	Creative Computing 2011 - Mid-point review	7/29/11 9:20	"Hi Larry, I too am very interested in exploring the PicoBoard and how I can use that in conjunction with science.  I would like to be able to recommend using the PicoBoard for the 4th-7th grader science projects. Is this something you would be interested in too?"2529	10275	Creative Computing 2011 - Mid-point review	7/29/11 9:24	"So I arrived late and haven't had the time to write down what my goals were for Scratch. I want to be able to use Scratch commands seamlessly so that I do not have to constantly debug. What else that has been useful is seeing how others have debugged code that make it easier for me when I come across the same problem. I learned about the ""hide"" and ""show"" functions which have made it 25% easier! My new goals are to see how creative I can really get with Scratch!"2530	10275	Creative Computing 2011 - Mid-point review	7/29/11 10:36	"My initial goal was to develop some very specific activities to support my classroom content standards, mostly ELA. I've been able to come up with ideas for demonstration/teaching, expression/student creation, and assessment. I still want to explore how Scratch can be used with Lego Mindstorms and also use a Pico board. Also, I have no idea how to use variables or lists."2531	10275	Creative Computing 2011 - Mid-point review	7/29/11 10:04	"My initial goal was to become more comfortable using Scratch and have a better understanding of it's capabilities. Wow.   Woke up this am with my head exploding with project ideas. Moving forward, I want to be more comfortable using variables. I also wondered if you can imbed a projct within a project."2532	10275	Creative Computing 2011 - Mid-point review	7/29/11 10:11	"My goals were to feel comfortable enough to share Scratch with my colleagues and students and to look at Scratch with robotics. Through the exercises with and without Scratch I DO feel comfortable to introduce Scratch to help people move forward in their creativity. I realize my goal is to help teachers see how they can integrate technologies, as an educator, that i am comfortable with, and you have provided us with so many tools. I have had some exciting conversations this morning with the people at the peach table about robotics. I believe we are getting together this afternoon to share what we know, what we don't know, and what we want to know."2533	10275	Creative Computing 2011 - Mid-point review	7/29/11 10:14	"I feel that I am on my way towards accomplishing my goals.  I am happy to have the opportunity to learn with other teachers, to hear what they are doing in their classrooms, their experiences with Scratch and their plans for the future.  I no longer feel that I am alone.  I feel that I have a commuinity of professionals that I can bounce ideas of off,and go to if (and when) I encounter problems. I have also really enjoyed the learning activities that Mitch and Karen have shared with us.  I can't wait to try these out with my students.  They really seem to encourage conversation and thinking, which would be great for my students.  It is amazing how you can learn ""computational thnking skills"" that don't always require using the computer. I also can't wait to work on my own project.  I look foward to the next two days to see what other wonderful new skills I can learn."2534	10275	Creative Computing 2011 - Mid-point review	7/29/11 10:41	I'd also like to hear about plans for future versions of Scratch--what will be included?2538	10275	Creative Computing 2011 - Mid-point review	7/30/11 5:33	"Thanks for the class. It has been great. I reached my goal and had the opportunity to talk to other teachers about creating a Scratch advocacy group for elementary students that runs across the curriculum. We have the beginnings of a working plan that we will post. I am looking forward to implementing it. One thought is It would be helpful if the Scratch team could provide us with some names  of administrators or policy types we could contact. My feelings are the more people we can contact the greater the chance of success. Thanks, Vicki"2539	10275	Creative Computing 2011 - Mid-point review	7/30/11 8:24	"Sally, I feel the same way.

You now need an extension helper app between the Scratch offline editor and the Arduino. Scratch speaks sends formatted queries to the extension app over a network socket (remote or localhost) and the app then communicates with the Arduino. Example: The Snap!Mobile - Start Your Physical Computing Engines! by MrYsLab (Instructables) www.instructables.com/id/The-SnapMobile-Start-Your-Physical-Computing-Engin/ Software extension (requires Python 2.x and a few modules): MrYsLab/s2a_fm: A Scratch Hardware Extension For Arduino github.com/MrYsLab/s2a_fm s2a_fm also requires the Arduino to be programmed with Firmata to process the commands and requests from the extension app. Caveats: 1) I have not tried this (decided that I don't need it for my course) 2) The Scratch team warns that the extension framework is subject to change.2601	10441	Questions for using Scratch in a Technology Club?	8/26/11 12:44	"Hi Stephen, Don't know if this will help at all, but you might want to check out Mesh for Scratch.

More information can be found at http://info.scratch.mit.edu/WeDo Over this past summer I taught a beginning robotics class to students in the 4th - 8th grades. I used the Lego Mindstorms  Mindstorms come with the NXT programming IDE which is as easy to learn as Scratch; but is directly made for the robots. Just drag and drop the code block icons on the stage, set the few paramenters, and your robot will come to life.  What I liked best about the Mindstorms is the ease of programming while teaching the basic fundamentals. Mesh is a network conduit for scratch based programs. It uses IP to allow scratch programs to communicate with each other. You could use this with your robotics, but the robot will need to have a scratch program, access to a network, and the ability to use the IP protocol."2830	10441	Questions for using Scratch in a Technology Club?	1/5/12 20:09	You might look at Enchanting if you are using Mindstorms robots.2613	10486	Creative Computing group photo	9/2/11 11:55	The photo is available at http://www.flickr.com/photos/38090850@N08/5992159736/in/pool-1721311@N20 I think it's fine to re-post...

Any suggestions on which grant would be most interested in involving tablets, app_inventor/scratch, and special ed kids. At this time, I cannot pin down the amount of money the project will need. In addition to the hardware, we will need to pay the ABA/SPED person for his great app idea.  Personally, in the design I am more excited that the kids will get to customize the app for personal expression, fun and for their own needs.

Over all, I am very pleased with the organization of the unit and how easily most of it is going into the unit. As far as I know, this is going to be the first programming unit, in our state, developed for middle schools to use as a blended course. If I can adapt the course to our state's online course standards, it could become available state-wide. So, again, I want to give my congrats to the ScratchEd Team - excellent work!

My middle school students meet for 40 minutes, three times weekly. I am finding that we need to spend a little more time on each session than I originally thought that we would-the students are interested in creating very ambitious projects already! We are using the resource cards, Susan's youtube channel, and projects from the Web site for guidance. I have been videotaping their sessions and then playing the films back to the other classes so different grades can view the projects being created in other classes. This is one way they are learning from each other and collaborating, even thouugh they may not all be meeting face-to-face. I also pull up specific projects in progress from other classes so students can see the scripts, etc. that other students are working out. The students in class are encouraged to travel around the room to offer help and view others' projects also. The reflection questions are something I really appreciate about this curriculum, and the maintenance of the design notebook. We usually close reflection time with a discussion/sharing session. My students struggled with the idea of sketching the arts- themed project. This was a good thing:They produced some great ideas! I had planned to integrate portions of the Calder curriculum into my plans with this, but so far I am sticking to the draft as written, and the students are learning so much with it.

My students are thinking and learning, and I am so appreciative of the materials you have provided. The students are growing in self-confidence and many are getting turned on to computer science. My question is, will there be an extension of this curriculum guide? I have some ""eager beavers"" in 6th and 7th grade who want to keep delving more deeply with Scratch, and I have been so pleased with the implementation of this in our school that I want to continue challenging the students next year. I'm planning to introduce PICOboards as an extension, but am wondring if you could point me towards some additional curricular resources for teaching Scratch.

Currently, there isn't an extended version of the guide although there are hopes to develop strategies for this in the future. Exactly how to do this? We're not sure yet. Do you have any suggestions? For your 6th and 7th graders, I might suggest the Scratch Programming Challenges or Design Studio Activities that I could imagine being formatted for a classroom lesson plan. Every few weeks, the Scratch Team also posts a new Design Studio prompt on the Scratch website (see the 4th post on the right column), so if you are able to access the website, that might be a way to engage the students with a wider audience. If you're interested in physical computing like the PicoBoards, the LEGO WeDo Robotics Kit is another physical extension that works with Scratch. You could also look through the middle school resources on ScratchEd to see if there's anything of interest there. Hope that helps. Let us know how it goes! M"3045	10945	Scratch Curriculum Guide Draft Feedback	3/22/12 14:16	"Thanks so much for providing this outstanding curriculum guide to me and my students. We have had a few bumps along the way and I know you are interested in how this currculum is working out for students, so I thought I would share the few challenges we encountered: My groups have made it through to Session #12 so far. Things have gone extremely well until we attempted the Scrolling starter project. This one has proved the most challenging task for my students so far, and the one with which they have encountered the most difficulties. Many (6-8) students were not able to independently follow the the handout very well on their own, so I broke it down for them into sequential steps. The steps to creating the program were obvious to me, but they had a little trouble following the handout on their own, and envisioning the end result. I searched the Web site for some scrolling examples, which helped the students understand precisely what the goal of the project was and that helped them understand the four frames displayed at the top of the handout, as well as the other visuals on the handout. There was some confusion over the creation of the 2 sprites with identical costumes, and then some students incorrectly coded their scripts. These problems were easily solved. However, even when all scripts seemed perfectly written, the costumes duplicated exactly, etc..,   we found that on some programs, the scrolling was ""buggy."" On these buggy  programs,the students figured out  that the order in which the variables and operator blocks are added to the stage script impacts the operation of the program. The script can ""look"" correct but not be sequenced correctly, and this is not obvious to the students when visually scanning for errors. Having these students rebuild the last two blocks on the stage script precisely from left to right seems to solve the scrolling problem for most. With more experience with Scratch, I might have been better able to advise them on this issue, but I was equally stumped for a while trying to figure out why some programs scrolled perfectly and others did not... Again, thank you. The ""bumps"" are looked upon as learning opportunities and not frustrations. -BP"3046	10945	Scratch Curriculum Guide Draft Feedback	3/22/12 15:20	"Hi BP, Thanks again for sharing this and I'm glad to hear that the you were able to resolve the ""bumps"". The scrolling project can definitely be challenging although still popular, and I can see where the handout might be lacking in terms of trying to translate the process of scrolling. This is great feedback for thinking about future iterations of the handout and activity. Thanks! M"3076	10945	Scratch Curriculum Guide Draft Feedback	4/8/12 7:27	"Thank you for the great curriculum guide. I began a Project Based Inquiry Learning Project this semester with the 7th grade challenge class. Their final challenge was to create a video story or game that included Ecological principles we explored during the unit to be able to present to a panel as to further educate the younger generation. I took the curriculum guide and modified it a bit to be more of a self-paced packet. Can I say that it was great! The students who could move faster did so. They were required to complete all the different skill sets; however, I gave them the freedom to incorporate a few into one which they did with out me telling them. Their final projects are wonderful. In an effort to assist with the managing of the files, I use a free pbworks account where students could upload their works in progress and then post their final projects. This seemed to be a bit more focused arena for the students. Students viewed the other projects and collaborated online as well as did a gallery walk on the final day. They learned some valuable tools. I had MOST of my class staying daily to work on scratch. Additionally, I had others that weren't in my classes want to learn.

This curriculum document is a very useful tool and I greatly appreciate those who created it. Like many curriculum documents, however, I find it to be too much of a bottom up approach. I have found over the years that the non-intuitive approach of teaching top down works better in the development of creative and criticial thinking. That is, my students start by identifying a problem that they want to solve or a goal they want to achieve and then drill down to figure out what knowledge they need to learn and find or create the resources that they need. I found that if I introduce the features of Scratch from the bottom up that this limited the students' creativity. It locked them in to solutions that only used those features. I want them to learn to ask, ""What features do I need in this language and how can I create them,"" rather than, ""how can I build something on top of the features that I have been taught."" I am using the curriculum document starting from the end, with the final project, and then letting students identify features that they think they need, and knowledge that they need to learn. For instance, they figured out that they need to learn how an arrow flies through the air for a game they wanted to create so they first went off and taught themselves enough physics. When they figure out that they need to write a piece of a program that repeates a certain number of times or until some event happens, they go look up if that is possible in Scratch. This is how I did engineering for many years and I want the students to be innovators and the drivers who create new technologies."3200	10945	Scratch Curriculum Guide Draft Feedback	5/29/12 8:53	"I used Session #3 in my class with kids ages 10-16 When I first showed the ""Bosses"" the videos, the reaction was no way, this is going to be hard.  I must admit I had the same reaction.  I (and I think the kids) figured that the video with Mitch would be possible, but some of the later ones would be too challenging.  Well I was wrong (love when that happens, I learn something new :) The kids did great and were able to program each other in a relatively short time. One thing I changed from the Draft is I had the  bosses and bossed switch.  Show I would show the first video and A would program B, then I would have B program A.  So they all got an opportunity to see both sides. I asked the question, ""How is this like programming?""  Which is similar to ""How does this activity relate to Scratch?""   Below are some of the comments from the students: We didn't know what was in the mind of the programmer. We had no idea what they wanted us to do. We had no ""insight"" (Note: I also have them taking the Coursera CS101 course on their own in a ""flipped classroom"" type approach.  One of the early comments in the course was that the computer, unlike a human has know insight into what you mean). We can only use words. After class I realized one of the questions I should have asked is ""How is this NOT like programming?""  I will try this next time. For homework, I am having them create a ""Dance"" program, where they take pictures of themselves in different dance positions, ""green screen"" their bodies out of the pictures and then program each other to dance.  I am also using Scratch connect and Etoys so they can create a ""game controller"" in Etoys to control the Dancers and can have a dance party on one screen projected on the wall, each student controlling their own dancer using Etoys (via Remote Sensor Protocol).  Can't wait until Makey Makey comes out so I can try incorporating that. Note: I had a class before this where we did ""How to Train Your Robot""  using Dr. Techniko's hand out and having them program their parents.  Not sure how much this impacted how quickly/easily they were able to program each other. I really like your approach of having kids ""step away from the computer and no one gets hurt"" approach.  I try to do this a lot, partly so they can get in touch and reflect upon the knowledge they have in their own bodies and also to give them different context for experiening the same/similar concepts and ideas,"3201	10945	Scratch Curriculum Guide Draft Feedback	5/29/12 10:31	"Hi Stephen, Thanks for sharing your experiences!

M"3247	10945	Scratch Curriculum Guide Draft Feedback	6/24/12 22:22	"I taught Session 3 again to a different group of kids and noticed how some of the moves are symmetrical (especially in Dance1).  I pointed this out to the kids (tried to do so through questions) and asked how are these moves the same and different.  Which led to the realization that its the same basic move once with the right hand and once with the left hand.  This then lead to a short discussion on how we can have a common set of instructions used by different body parts/costumes/objects.  In a future version of the class I would like to try and point this out immediately after Dance 1 and see how many kids ""get the idea"" and use it for Dances 2 and 4. Dance 3 doesn't really lend itself to this idea. It would be nice if the third video also included ceratin moves like this so that I can use ""the same script"" with different body parts through all the Dances to help re-inforce this concept.  Of course, the videos are so well done (and the more I watch them I appreciate how well thought out) there may be a reason http://vimeo.com/28612800  does not have a similar pattern. One thing that I believe could be useful for teachers is a set of additional ""questions"" and/or short videos on ""how to use these sessions.""  That said you have to balance providing a quick to the point lesson plan for busy teachers with more in depth/additional materials.  Perhaps as an optional section or additional resources and ideas for each session in a way that is easy for teachers to find and use (ie: not just in discussion notes :)"3803	10945	Scratch Curriculum Guide Draft Feedback	1/30/13 11:45	"I have been using the Scratch Curriculum Guide for about one month now to advance my 6th graders' knowledge of Scratch.  I started my Scratch unit by having stduents complete the Scratch cards, the orange square purple circle project, a scratch design studio project of their own choosing, and a remix project.  I then had them start working on the Scratch Curriculum Guide projects.  I let the students work at their own pace since they all completed the scratch cards at different times. When I use the Scratch Curriculum Guide next time, I will have all of the students complete the same project on the same day.  I will also do the scratch design studio project and the remix after they have already completed the Scratch Curriculum Guide.  I will also add the space invaders project as a remix project and use the Scratch Diving Deeper Challenges to push their programming to the next level. I love giving my students a packet of projects to complete at their own pace, but I found that some students completed 10 projects in the time some of their classmastes created 2 or 3.  I would love to have them moving through the curriculum more as a group so they can collaborate, share their projects, give each other feedback, and discuss different methods for solving the same challenge."3812	10945	Scratch Curriculum Guide Draft Feedback	2/1/13 16:17	"Hi Megan, I love your idea of using a combination of Scratch Design Studio themes, remixing projects, and Diving Deeper challenges to help students continue to engage creatively and move further with programming. Thanks for sharing your feedback and ideas!

I have used it as an inspiration to prepare my sessions, sometimes using it as-is, sometimes inventing my own activities. So I thought it was time to give feedback on what has worked well or not so well for me. It’s a lot of information that I tried to summarize, don’t hesitate to ask for more details if my point is not clear. In my sessions, I have 10 kids from 8 to 10 for an hour and a half every school week. We are are now getting to sessions 14. As a general rule, I have found that what works better is to show at the beginning of sessions examples of target projects to give them ideas of what they can do. The projects have to be simple enough that they will be able to do it, and generic enough that they leave room for personalization, personal creativity. I have sometimes used the curriculum project examples (for the art session #5 for example), or made/curated my own. It works better than trying to explain “how” to do things at the beginning of the sessions (a mistake I made at the beginning). Then I give them the paper handouts with project code example, and I explain “on demand” when they want to do something something and are wondering how. Examples that work well: -          Session #5 -          To invent stories creating their own sprites and background, I had this studio of examples : Session #4 and 5 were too much alike, kids had a repetition feeling, and were less motivated. Session #5 Art projects : I used your projects examples and handouts, and it worked great. Session #6 : I did not get the point of the 6-word story, so I did not try it. Instead, I replaced session 6 and 8  with a three sessions work on creating stories, that worked tremendously well: -          First workshop : I told kids that that would be creating a story but that they couldn’t use the image library in Scratch, and would have to create their own (drawing, drawing with scratch, modelling playdough, photographing persons and objects)  showed them examples I had created aor curated : http://scratch.mit.edu/studios/292530/ . I had kids pick up an image among 10 that made them feel like telling a story, creating groups with people having chosen the same image. Then they spent the sessions inventing the story and creating the sprites and background, and we took pictures. -          Second workshop : Work on notebook to remember the story outline. Import images in scratch and create project. A lot of time was spent in importing and clipping images, so one session was not enough to finish the project. -          Third workshop : finish project. Session #7 (Remix) was very valuable. For some kids, the second time changing computers was too much, and they dropped it. These were the less proficient kids. So next time might do only one swap. The session led to very interesting discussion with the kids on how you should save your work (some team made huge modification and previous versions were lost), on how it was great to enhance some one else program, and how hard it was to see your work modified. Session #9 debug and session #10 Maze: great. As I have an hour and a half, I mixed it with the maze, and I used a Makey Makey and big tinfoil arrows to play the maze, and this was a great session. #11 Maze extensions (variable) Works great, my only reserve is that the variable project example have different level of complexity, and it was harder for some kids as I distributed the projects randomly. Having the kid explain what they learn and show how they used it in their maze extension was very effective. #12 more games : I extended it on two sessions, as kids wanted to finish their projects. I used a leap motion for more fun on the collision project. The scrolling project is way too hard. I think I will replace it with a “change level when reaching  a door on the stage” kind of example. I will keep the scrolling example for older kids, or if a kid specifically asks for it. Design notebook : I have had difficulties in systematically use them.  I have been thinking of preparing specific design notebook with an entry for each session. Do you have best practices on how this topic? I would be very interested."4760	10945	Scratch Curriculum Guide Draft Feedback	8/31/14 1:23	"So where does one locate the ""About me"" handout mentioned in Session #2?

Although there are optimizations that save most of the work when nothing changes, it still takes some processing time just to check. When I first open Scratch viewing the default project, Scratch consumes about 2.5% of the CPU on my MacBook Pro. If I open a project with many sprites, it goes up to 4.3% However, there a more significant cycle consumer. The sound player seems to use about 11% of my CPU even when no sounds are playing. The sound player is started the first time any sound is played and it is never shut down after that. So Scratch burns about 13.5% of the CPU time on my computer after playing a sound. Finally, if you use the ""loudness"" or ""loud"" blocks, that opens the sound input channel, which seems to burn another 5%. I agree, this seems excessive for ""doing nothing"". Scratch should probably turn off the sound input and output channels when they haven't been used for a while."2784	11048	Scratch hogs my CPU	11/29/11 20:39	Thanks!2767	11094	Monthly Webinars?	11/20/11 17:18	"Hi Susan, Our next webinar is on November 30 (see http://scratched.eventbrite.com/ for more information).

Luego, usando las piezas de Lego WeDo y los recursos tomados de la caja recreábamos la historia usando Scratch, y finalmente pasabamos frente al grupo y mostrabamos el producto programado mientras contábamos nuestra historia.

Also students can see how computational ideas have developed and sustained over time. Here is an excellent wiki by Cynthia Solomon who worked with Dr. Papert during the development of Logo.

In other words, let's assume that I have used the workflow described above and translated the built-in Help into Dutch, how long would it take for the others to be able to download an updated version of Scratch with the updated translation?"2836	11453	How to contribute to the translation of built-in help documentation?	1/8/12 17:56	"That's a great question -- but, unfortunately, I don't know the answer.

As it stands now, there are no plans to release additional versions of Scratch based on the Scratch 1.4 codebase. So it won't be possible for others to download and install a version of Scratch with updated help files until Scratch 2.0 is released - probably in late 2012. However - if you do translate the help files and send them to us, we'll make them available on our Languages resource page: http://info.scratch.mit.edu/Languages So it will be possible for people to download your translated help files and manually install them in Scratch 1.4 (replacing the English versions that are included by default). But this must be done manually, so it's not ideal for most end-users. The good news is that Scratch 2.0 will be all ""in the cloud"" - meaning it will run in the browser, and won't require Scratchers to download or install anything. This will make it much easier for us to update translations. As soon as we get a new translation, we can make it live in Scratch 2.0. Hope this helps.

Amanda :)2949	11797	Comments on how your students learn	2/10/12 8:12	"Scott - The new curriculum from MIT Media Lab has been very helpful to us.  I just posted over there: When I started actually using Scratch as a regular part of class last year, I knew those step by step directions that were out on the Internet were not what I wanted but I just didn't know it well enough myself to have put together a curriculum. I worked with an organization that was doing gaming for teens but even they only put together step by step instructions. This curriculum that you put together and the ed community has really enlivened my teaching and has brought out the best in my students! Scott - My students are 14-17. Yesterday we did a shared Scratch conversation with Betty Pickett's students who are about 13 via Skype video. We had a great time and I think it will inspire both groups to higher levels with Scratch. We'd love to share with your group!"2933	11800	resources for an afterschool Scratch club for 4th-5th graders	2/6/12 18:50	I think this is a really good idea. :) Have you seen the Scratch curriculum guide?2935	11800	resources for an afterschool Scratch club for 4th-5th graders	2/6/12 19:16	"Hi, Yes, that was one of the first things I looked at. It seems like it is aimed at college students, or advanced high school students though. It is definitely way too much and too serious for an elementary afterschool club.  Also, all I could find was a large Word document that refers to handouts. Am I missing something? thanks, Bonnie"2937	11800	resources for an afterschool Scratch club for 4th-5th graders	2/6/12 19:44	"I agree that there's additional structure that doesn't make sense for afterschool, but the activities (e.g. handouts that are located at the end of the guide) can work. I ran an afterschool program for 4th and 5th graders that use the activities in the guide -- Something Surprising, All About Me, Dance Party, etc. -- not as prescribed activities, but as potential activities for kids to work on. I'd show a small aspect of Scratch, then let people loose to work on their own projects. Something that has also worked well for me is to show a little each session, point kids to the Scratch online community or to the Scratch Cards. Hope that helps!"2938	11800	resources for an afterschool Scratch club for 4th-5th graders	2/6/12 20:21	We won't be able to use the online community unfortunately! That isn't allowed in our district.

Very sad."2954	11800	resources for an afterschool Scratch club for 4th-5th graders	2/10/12 10:41	"Hi Bonnie - So sad! Do you think they don't understand what Scratch is? Is such an easy, small, FREE application to install. Best of luck getting Scratch in your district. If you get the chance to get this going, I agree with what others I have said. I have an afterschool Scratch Club with about 30 students grades 3-7. I rely heavily on the Scratch Cards (I have 20 sets), and the sample projects from the Curriculum Guide. I printed those out in color and laminated a bunch to have for project starters for students.  I've also done 3 minute challenges where we toss out an idea and everyone tries to do it in 3 minutes, sharing successful projects. An important thing to keep in mind is having a goal to build towards - we share our projects at the Math Carnival night in March as well as at Art Night in May. We've also had a Share Day where parents are invited to the Club to view student projects - we had half the students sharing at a time so the students had the chance to view each other's work."2956	11800	resources for an afterschool Scratch club for 4th-5th graders	2/10/12 10:46	"Hi Bonnie, that's too bad. I also ran into the same road block when I tried to get a Scratch Club started at my son's middle school (6-8th grades) one spring. It's very hard to get schools to change anything in the middle of the year, and I was asking them to install a 'beta' version too which was viewed with suspicion. However, at the end of that school year I recruited support from a teacher in the school, and over the summer we got them to install Scratch on the computers, and started the club the following fall. That was six years ago, and the Scratch Club is still going strong (and the principal promotes it to incoming 5th graders when they visit!). So my advice would be to start asking for Scratch to be put on computers at the end of this school year, and to keep asking over the summer. If you wait until August they will probably have already decided what updates they're doing and it may be too late. Good Luck! --Chris"2961	11800	resources for an afterschool Scratch club for 4th-5th graders	2/11/12 19:38	Hi can you not run Scratch from usb pen drives ?   it means then that Scratch is not being installed on any pc's and I am sure you would be able to get help with donations of usb's to do so anywhere.

With Scratch, this is how I aproached it. If the students have a personal email, I encouraged them to get their own Scratch account (with their parents'/guardians' permission), but for those who do not yet have their own email, I am uploading their projects for them through my account. (Some of my 8th grade students do have their own accounts, but most of the younger students do not.) The students are saving their work to the school network. From there, I display projects on the SMARTboard for group discussion and as a class we share(upload) them online through my computer. We also have downloaded some projects from the website to the school network through my account and the students are beginning to learn about remixing. When posting information to be shared publicly, I cautioned the students to be mindful of revealing personal information.

It's the teacher's to evaluate how much the student's project is a real evolution of the original project. Sometimes students tend to hide the fact that they started from someone else's project. That is why I'm asking my students to develop Scratch-only projects to present to the discussion for their exams. Even if I explain both Scratch and BYOB, I must rely on the incredibly useful ability of the Scratch website of spotting remixes (something that I do not explain to my students :-) I can immediately understand if a project is not by a student, but I must be able to show to the student the original project otherwise... it would be just my opinion."3019	12050	Concerns about remixing?	3/8/12 17:18	"I really like the idea of the ""evolution"" of a project...

Scratch 1.4 was built on top of the Squeak programming system. Squeak supports arbitrary length integers, so Scratch took advantage of that feature. Both the Java-based online Scratch player and the new Flash-based one represent numbers interally as double precision floating point numbers (64-bit). So, unfortunately, the online version of Scratch will no longer support infinite precision integers. Of course, you can continue to use Scratch 1.4 for projects that require infinite precision integers, but people will need to download your projects and play them with Scratch 1.4 to get the correct results; online, they will get floating point approximations, which I realize may be useless in certain kinds of projects (e.g. projects involving large prime numbers such as public key cryptography). Floats have 52-bits of mantissa, so if you stick to working with numbers up to 2^25 or so, you can get exact results. But I realize one would rather not have to think about such implementation details... -- John"3054	12195	Arbitrarily long integers	3/30/12 13:23	"Thanks for this feedback, John!  It is a bit disappointing news, though. One thing I really liked about Scratch is what you indicate in your last paragraph - one did not have to think about such precision issues, and I could make a nerdy project  (Scrip & Flip) that computes Pi to 10,000 digits with two very simple scripts. On the other hand, most people will never notice the difference, so I guess it's ok."3056	12195	Arbitrarily long integers	3/30/12 15:02	"Yes, I'm also disappointed to lose that feature.

Certainly some songs that appear on the Scratch website are way over the line of appropriateness and are taken down. Other songs, which are somewhat risqué (particularly for a school setting), are significant parts of popular culture. This music is important to many young creators and inspires their creative work in all sorts of interesting ways. It's further complicated by the fact, as you point out, that some of these projects are very simple. For some Scratchers, this is a starting point -- a starting point that leads to amazing project development and wouldn't have been possible without those simple, humble beginnings. What seems like a lot of junk could be the first step along a creative pathway with programming. So, as you can imagine, we're disinclined to actively seek out simple projects and remove them, even though some people might not progress past these initial interactions. As it seems like you've already started to do, this is a great opportunity for conversations with your students -- about appropriate content, about what constitutes a substantive Scratch project, about how to build a productive and respectful learning community.

We show the children how to put together two blocks (we usually start with the ""move"" block and ask them what will happened if we will change the number from 10 to 100). We show them 2 simple projects, one game one story / animation, and give them an open task. ""Create a project with at least one sprite moving side to side and in the middle something surprising happens"". We try to stay as un-constructed as possible. Usually, most kids start working on the task and quickly drift away, each child to his own style, and this method works great for us. The biggest pitfall is when you show the example projects, most chances are that some kids will try to create a project same as what you showed, so try to keep them simple as possible and without any advanced features like broadcast, variables and so on… If you need anything else, feel free to ask.

With variables you ""take note"" of your environment. In Scratch very often you don't nedd them, as you have sensors and reporters (position x, position y, etc). They give you the possibility to look at your environment, without having to take note by means of a further instrument. Even a score can be managed in Scratch with a ""progress bar"" or by numerical costumes of several sprites. But variables are a very good example and when and way to use a variable.

They did add a few new blocks, so this might be one more that ought to be added. I don't think I am asking another sprite to run one of its blocks. I'm packing up a little bunch of my code and telling another sprite to run that. I'm not sure what I would suggest, but that ""of"" block is awkwardly overloaded and counter-intuitive. If it's the one thing that I have to tell my students, ""yes, this is how it works, it is wierd, you'll just have to roll with it"", then it maybe should be considered to be a candidate for tweeking. Are you able to address the ""It's easy in SmallTalk, why so awkward in Snap!?"" question at all. >> Why does the ""of"" block have to be in a launch block instead of a report block? > If you click on the ""the script (set age to 3)) of (clone)"" script, you will see, as a result, a script. So, by inserting this script inside report, you will just pass this script around, you won't execute it in any way. Instead, by using launch or run, you will ask the clone to actually run this script, so the variable will be really set. I am well aware that the ""the script"" block reifies the code inside it, so it is not necessary to explain that to me. I am quite fond of languages with first class functions and pass them around like mad whenever the opportunity arises. But I'm not inserting the script inside the report or launch block. I'm inserting it inside the ""of"" block. It is the ""of"" block that may be inserted inside a report or launch block as the case may be. The ""of"" block itself is not reified. After some thought, I realize that I have the answer and it's almost obvious. The ""of"" block is executed, because it's an argument to the launch block. The ""of"" block evaluates to the value (the script (set age to 3)). During evaluation the major side effect is that a clone is created. The value of the expression, i.e., the script is passed as an argument to the launch block. Somehow, in the process, this value is tagged as applying to the particular sprite that just got cloned, so when the launch block is executed it executes that script for the cloned sprite. This is not a process I really want to be explaining to my students in the fifth week of class, yet message passing itself is alluring. The ownership of a script is not shown in BYOB in any way. So, if I set the variable f to the result of (the script (set age to 3) of (clone)) and I then click on x to see its value, I see the script, but not the fact that it belongs to the particular sprite that just got cloned. This still means that ""of' is overloaded a little bizarrely, because the code is assigned to the object on the right hand side of the ""of'. That is not the usual meaning of ""of"" and doesn't match up well with the suggested values in the drop down menu, like x-position. I think I would like a single tell block for message passing. Here is an instance of its use. tell clone to (the script (set age to 3)) It is not general, but it is nice and simple. I could, of course, write such a thing myself for when I teach my class next year, but then I would have to make sure my class loaded that particular block all the time,which adds overhead."3103	12449	BYOB semantics question	4/17/12 12:46	"If I correctly understand your suggestion (in which case I completely agree with you) by creating the tell block you would move the ""of"" to the launch block, that is, instead of launch ((the script (set age to 3)) of (clone)) you would like something link launch (the script (set age to 3)) of (clone) I admit that when you evaluate the of block the reference to the sprite completely disappear. This is not necessary in Scratch (as the result is simpy a value) but if you are able to execute that very result by using a launch/run block, then the reference to the sprite should be somewhere. Currently this is too opaque. To me your proposal is fine. Even if, for my porposes of ""natural"" or ""spontaneous"" programming (that I strongly support), the entire launch block is really too much (and I don't explain it to my students). Indeed, when you think to sprites as real animated entities, you will never have the possibily to impose another sprite to do something. The correct mechanism, at least in my theoretical programming environment, would be sending the sprite a message (hopefully with parameters). If the sprite is willing to accept that request it will be equipped by a suitable ""receive"" block. This is what I would strongly support. Instead, Brian and Jens, that support more powerful and flexible programming languages, immediately refused my view. My goal is the same of yours: if you make it easier to understand (and to me what is closer to the real world is easier) students will learn it sooner and use it better."3105	12449	BYOB semantics question	4/18/12 2:02	"Hi Anne, thanks for these thoughtful and ""real life"" remarks about the issues you encountered teaching OOP with BYOB. It's very exciting for us that you're pressing ahead in pioneering a college level programming course based on BYOB! I share your concerns in part about overloading the OF block. OTOH instead of sending a textual message which resolves to a method (-name) in the receiver BYOB sends BLOCKS (and scripts). Personally I think that's easier to understand (and to visualize) than having to somehow get a textual handle for blocknames, which would also have to include further (textual) syntax for parameters etc. However, when a sprite sends ""a block"" to another sprite, it sometimes doesn't know whether such a block even exists for the receiver. In a textual language such as Smalltalk this doesn't really matter, because a message is after all just a string, and if it doesn't match with one of the receiver's own or inherited methods the receiver just answers #doesNotUnderstand. In a blocks based language the equivalent to a method name is the ""block shape"" (or block prototype, as we call it), and the equivalent of the method itself is the block's definition body, i.e. the script attached to the prototype's hat block in the block editor. Therefore, in the OF block we're asking the receiving sprite to identify a block ""such as this one"" indicated by one the sender itself knows about. For future versions of SNAP we're considering a more generic way to describe ""block shapes"", so that they can be sent to other sprites even if the sender doesn't already have a similar-looking block itself. Does this all make sense? Oh, one more thing: This way of having to CALL (or RUN/LAUNCH) a block answered by the receiver certainly isn't self explanatory. That's why - foreseeing this difficulty - we put explicit TELL (obj) (action) ASK (obj) FOR (reporter) blocks in our TOOLS sprite. These blocks should be pretty much exactly what you're suggesting, right? We're thinking about always loading them whenever SNAP is launched, but still letting users open a block editor on them so they can demystify message passing for themselves by looking at the - surprisingly simple - implementation code. Do you think this would help you and your students? Thanks! -Jens"3106	12449	BYOB semantics question	4/18/12 11:33	"I'll take the blame for this one.  My sense of what's elegant doesn't always match that of normal people. :-/ It's exactly right that we were trying to minimize the number of new blocks in the (hopeless) quest to convince the Scratch Team to incorporate our ideas in Scratch 2.0.  And, if you think about just the original Scratch OF block, what it's doing is precisely message passing.  ""X position"" is a message (a text string), and ""Sprite2"" is [the name of, since they're not first class in Scratch] an object. So it seemed most elegant to me, since we were already handed a message passing block, to use that block for all message passing. We added the TELL and ASK blocks to the tool sprite because we quickly learned that other people didn't find the generalized OF as elegant as I still do. :-(  If we provide TELL and ASK on startup, will you mind that they're implemented using OF?  You don't have to teach it to your students. About RUN/LAUNCH vs. CALL, this issue has nothing to do with OOP.  We inherit from Scratch the fact that some blocks report a value, while others don't.  The former are oval or hexagonal; the latter are jigsaw-shaped.  This is why we have THE BLOCK and THE SCRIPT instead of a single lambda, and it's why, correspondingly, you CALL a reporter block but you RUN a script (which might be a single command block).  LAUNCH is just a variant of RUN that starts a new thread, like BROADCAST vs. BROADCAST AND WAIT respectively.  It's convenient to use LAUNCH with message-passing, but you can LAUNCH a new thread within a single sprite. About BYOB vs. Smalltalk, what I think is that part of the genius of Scratch was to finesse the distinction between a procedure and its name -- to a kid, ""the MOVE 10 STEPS block"" and ""the 'MOVE 10 STEPS' block"" mean the same thing.  If you view a message as being the name of a method, this means that in Scratch it's really hard to make a distinction between message and method.  A block is its own name.  Almost all the time, in Scratch, this unproblematically lets kids get on with writing programs without having to think at all about the language semantics.  But in BYOB it sometimes makes it harder to express oneself precisely.  Jens, did I get this right? I note in passing that some Scratch block names are quite long, and you'd get tired of typing ""GLIDE _ SECS TO X: _ Y: _"" as a message after a while.  Using the reified block as its own message /is/ terse and simple, looked at from the right angle. :-) We are about to rethink all this for Snap! because we want to generalize the OOP system to include other kinds of objects, e.g., costumes and sounds.  If we keep the same message passing approach, we'll be overloading the second input of OF as well as the first. Nothing is settled yet.  But we'll certainly provide ASK and TELL (we need both for the same reason as CALL and RUN) on startup."3123	12449	BYOB semantics question	4/22/12 20:20	"Thanks Jens. I appreciate all the hard work on BYOB/Snap!. It's been a very interesting experience teaching with BYOB and I don't think the class would have been nearly as successful in another language.

So, if I set the variable f to the result of (the script (set age to 3) of (clone)) and I then click on x to see its value, I see the script, but not the fact that it belongs to the particular sprite that just got cloned. This is an issue we inherit from Scratch, although the difficulties aren't as obtrusive in Scratch. Take the MOVE 10 STEPS block.  To everyone except Jens and John Maloney, this seems to be one universal block.  But in fact that's not how Scratch thinks about it.  Actually each sprite has its own local MOVE 10 STEPS block.  The outward notation would be a better fit to the actual internal mechanism if the block were labelled MOVE SPRITE4 10 STEPS etc.  So, even primitive blocks should really have a mechanism to show which sprite they belong to. As soon as things slow down (""real soon now,"" as we used to say in the MIT Science Fiction Society) we'll design a serious debugger, which will have the ability to display the owner of any block/script, primitive or user-created.  With OOP it's even a little more complicated since a sprite can inherit (share) a block owned by its parent. Even without thinking about objects, a very similar situation arises when we display the text of a procedure to represent the procedure; that leaves out the defining environment, from which the procedure may get access to local state variables (e.g., for a THE SCRIPT inside a custom block).  You just have to allow that the displayed representation of a value may not include every attribute of that value.  When you evaluate an expression whose value is a sprite (in BYOB 3.1), what you see is a speech balloon containing a picture of the sprite's costume.  You don't see its position, or, more importantly, the values of its local variables.  You need a debugger for that."3104	12459	Custom Block Types	4/17/12 18:37	"Hi, Bernd.

I can't believe how easy it is to give in to the ""we just want time to work and learn and not keep talking"" line from students!  I've been so happy that everyone is so engaged with Scratch that sometimes it seems even odd to me to take away from a chunk of experimenting time to sit and talk together. Yet of course there's more to it than just that... I think we need to keep articulating the importance of when you work and when you talk and the relationship - especially with ""computer"" courses and with large classes in school. Maybe this is less of an issue for afterschool programs. We're at the point of making games. We are launching this ""unit"" - although I have a feeling it will be the rest of the year... by visiting the collection at the Museum of the Moving Image and in fact our tour will have an emphasis on the history of the moving image and early video games. When we return, I plan to do some game theory. One activity is a box filled with odd objects and groups make ""games."" I'm hoping this will help bring us back to our good sharing environment. It seems natural that Scratch would lead to more complex programming issues. I'd like to also know how other teachers keep the interative thinking going with more advanced users. I don't think we're at a point where Scratch will no longer meet our needs so how have others done troubleshooting when a few students are really stuck? I've directed some to the open Scratch community but it's too late in the game for them to have patience for looking how to find help. I'm thinking that next year, the use of the community needs to have a much greater place in the curriculum from the start.

It's rare for Scratch to get this error, so I'm curious what's happening. Does the student know which script causes the error? Does his project use a lot of long sound recordings or large images?

Scratch+WeDo is one of the main reasons why I'm interested in Scratch for my own kids and considering introducing it to their school: I can think of no better way to show kids that programming is also about the REAL (physical) world! It would definitely be a pity if children are either directed to use the old Scratch or the very limited WeDo software. Actually (...and now I almost feel rude for mentioning it) - I was in fact hoping that Scratch 2.0 would address not only Lego WeDo but also the ""next step"", namely Lego Mindstorms. Mindstorms is the closest there is to a de facto standard for robitics for kids out there. Dare I ask if Scratch+Mindstorms is even mentioned among the developers?

We plan to support the WeDo and Scratch Sensor Board, as in Scratch 1.4. We also plan to extend the WeDo support over time to to support multiple WeDo hubs and control over multiple motors. And, in the long term, we'll make it possible others to connect Scratch to other sensors and devices (e.g. the Microsoft Kinect) with a mechanism similar to the current Remote Sensors Protocol. However, we want to get Scratch 2.0 lauched as soon as possible, so it may launch without some or all of these features and they will be introduced over time. As of now, we don't plan to do anything with Scratch and LEGO Mindstorms -- but thanks for the suggestion. Note that, unlike the WeDo, Mindstorms is npt designed to remain ""tethered"" to the user's computer, so once the Mindstorms was programmed it would not interact with Scratch. It would be nice to have Scratch-like tool for programming the Mindstorms, but such a tool would be better as it's own thing, rather than as an extension of Scratch. -- John"3198	12673	Remote Sensor Protocol?	5/27/12 11:58	"John, thank you for your reply and the positive news on Lego WeDo + 2.0 !!!

Arbitrarily, let's say you assign 0 to the darkest colors and 500 to the lightest. Then you could create a maze project where your sprite is programmed to behave a certain way when hitting the walls (when color =0, turn right). Then hold up a maze to the webcam and see if your sprite can make it through. Another option might be to create image filtering art projects, similar in function to Instagram or Photobooth. Use commonds like ""if color > 400, change color to random"". Just a thought. :)"3184	12687	Try Scratch 2.0 from May 17-21	5/22/12 8:51	"Hi, David. Thanks for the suggestion. We've been experimenting with sensing color from the video using the existing color touching blocks. The idea is that, when the video is turned on, those blocks could sense colors from either things on the stage or from the video. If it works well enough, that would allow users to draw mazes and hold them up to a webcam as you suggest, as well as projects such as those shown in this (old) video created by Jay Silver and Eric Rosenbaum, two graduate students in the group: ?????????? http://vimeo.com/9512436. It's an interesting idea to sense only brightness. One of the big issues with color involves calibration to different cameras and lighting conditions. A brightness sensor might also require some calibration, but since it's just a single threshold, it's much easier to work with, similar to using the ""loudness"" block. I can imagine that many projects would not need any calibration at all and, if they did, a single slider would be sufficient. -- John"3185	12687	Try Scratch 2.0 from May 17-21	5/22/12 9:26	"Hi Pratibha, You just caught the site when it closed again.

Even if some of the new features are not fully ""newbie-proof"" as I expected, nevertheless being able i) to run Scratch from you browser without any need for installation and ii) to directly inspect other members' projects is a great improvement. I'm sure everything will be perfectly redesigned before the official release. Even cloud variables (even if I don't expect to use them a lot) will allow students to have a lot of fun. What is that I like really a lot? Custom blocks and clones. And I expect to love a lot the new vector-graphics image editor too (not accessible yet). What I don't like at present? Some ""hidden"" behaviours: it is not immediate to understand if and how custom blocks can have arguments; it is not immediate to manage clones; it is not immediate (in version 2.0, it used to by immediate in Scratch 1.x) to access sprite's info (name, position, etc).

I have used most features - except the video camera stuff. I teach programming to 6th graders and I can see Scratch 2.0 will be an excellent tool. The Make your own block was essential and it is finally here. I used to use Logo just for the Procedures/ defines and now I can stay with Scratch for the entire year. I will even be able to teach a little on recursion. BTW a longer recursion crashed - not sure if this is something that will be fixed later - a graceful exit perhaps for programs that have bugs/take too many resources? The Make block parameters is very nicely done, though not as obvious with different shapes for different data types. Also if you delete the block define by dragging it off by mistake, it does not come back! Love the cloning feature but needs some explanation. I was not sure what code must go into Clone startup and what can go into the main loop. A best practices lesson on this is important. Did you remove the commenting feature - my students do not write comments but am hoping they will one day! I hope that you will provide a class account - a local community so my students can safely share their early projects within a class but not the entire community. I am very excited about the vector graphics. My students have used Inkscape, open source vector graphics software and now they can create directly in Scratch. Vector graphics have a clear math connection and can be an integral part of the lesson, not just as a way to create graphics.

Damn good question and I LOVED Karen's line: ""Some of the things that are easiest to evaluate are not the things we care about."" The problem is that the things that are easy (ie: quick and inexpensive) and ""fair"" (standarizable across a wide population) to assess are not what I care about. What do I hope kids learning: Certain Habits of Mind that will serve them well in life and make them better citizens. Confidence that they can create things they care about. Help others How to work with others and build a team Explore different ways of Knowing/expressing something Write it in Scratch, JavaScript, programming another person, etc. Balancing Churchill and Twain Never, Never, Never Give Up. - Winston Churchill Try, Try again, then give up. There no sense making a damn fool of yourself - Mark Twain NOTE: I like giving kids conflicting suggestions.  First it forces them to think.  Second, It requires them to look for appropriate balances and realize things are not always black and white. Try understanding “Why it works” (especially after ""hunting and pecking"" until you get an answer) Look for connections Things I look for and questions/comments I ask/make toward this end. How is these two things the same and how are they different? How else could you do this? Do the simplest thing possible to make it work. Then you can refine later. Its okay to make mistakes. I expect mistakes. In fact if you aren’t making mistakes you aren’t trying hard enough. What can you learn from that mistake? Learn from the mistakes of others. You don't have time to make them all yourself. Wow that’s cool, how did you do that? How did you come up with that idea? What did you try that didn’t work? If a student finishes early, ask them to help someone else. Part of this is training them to help in a way, that builds up the other students and tries to question them toward an answer, or provide examples or small pieces of code they can look at and try and figure out. That said, sometimes, doing it for them is appropriate. Make mistakes on purpose and see what happens. Done with text based languages so they can see the error the compiler produces and get a better understanding and appreciation of the error messages. Give them: Wheres the bug problems. Read their code out loud to themselves and imagine/visulize/kineticize (move your hands/body to mimic what the code is doing, good for drawing shapes projects). I tell them reading it out loud helps you slow down and see what your code is really doing, which is often NOT what you want it to do.  (“Do what I meant, Not what I said”) Its okay to copy (re-use and hopefully re-mix) Can you make this a re-usable compoment that you can use in other projects?

Yes there are differences in what they may have produced but for enjoyment and learning still the same. The scratch cards are a definite to start off with as its the best introduction as to what Scratch can offer. The only problems I ever had were technological ones, always handy to have Scratch on a usb drive just in case. Amanda"3214	12940	Scratch 1 week summer class for middle schoolers	6/3/12 14:17	"Thanks, Amanda.  That is GOOD to hear!"3216	12940	Scratch 1 week summer class for middle schoolers	6/5/12 23:16	"Carol, Couple of things that have worked for me. 1) there are certain kids who ""get it"" quicker than others and when they finish early these kid can be used to help/teach others. Also, it doesn't always have to the ones who ""get it"" quicker, its especially gratifying if you can find one child of low self-esteem and find a way that they can teach other kids something new.  It is great when you can have the kids be the teachers.   The guiding principle I try (and often fail) to use is let the kids be the teachers.  This has its limits and you can't expect kids to learn everything themselves, but there are opportunities for it to happen and ideally you can help orchestrate it happening. 2) During my classes many kids will be working independently on different parts of their project and I need a way to get their attention when one of them does something ""cool"" that I want to point out (and name the behavior idea) for the rest of the class.  I generally hate to yell to get their attention, so I developed a technique where I simply clap (in some short rhythm).  At firs tthe kids may look then ignore it, but I repeat (NOT saying a word) until all the kids look at me and start to repeat the clap. I will visually (and in some cases verbally with as few words as possible) encourage them to repeat my rhthym.  They usually get it and when they repat I tell them what a great thing did and tell them why it was great and name the powerful idea. 3) At the beginning of a set of ""classes"" I will encourage them to make mistakes.  I think the culture of the class plays a very important role in learning.  One of the first things I do when teaching (school or sports) a new group of kids is to encourage them to make mistakes and how to handle them.  A couple of phrases I use are: If you aren't making mistakes, you aren't trying hard enough. Congratulations you made a mistake, now what can we learn from it? Learn from the mistakes of others, you don't have enough time to make them all yourself. I also tend to model mistake making (sometimes intentionally :) In dealing mistakes I use the bathroom analogy (stolen from PCA,  nytimes article here, on flushing mistakes and filling their emotional tanks, which is equally important). 4) I sometimes find kids doing something completly different from what I had intended.  In my bad moments I will try and correct them.  I had one kid who was laughing histically and doing something related to the task at hand, but far from the intended task.  At first I tried to ""nudge"" him back on task. This was a mistake, which I fortunately realized quickly and the kid fortunatly ignored me and did what was fun and motivating for him (and he was learning and doing cool new things which the other kids saw)."3218	12940	Scratch 1 week summer class for middle schoolers	6/7/12 22:49	"Hi Stephen, Thanks for your ideas, especially the point about making mistakes.  VERY important, but I hadn't thought about explicitly teaching that.  We will now!

The iPad version of Scratch will be limited by both the hardware and by Apple's policies. It may not support all the features of Scratch 2.0, some projects may run slowly, and, due to Apple's policies, it might not be allowed to download and run projects from the Scratch website. There are two basic approaches to iPad Scratch (HTML5 vs. native iPad App), and each approach has strenghts and weaknesses. We will explore both approaches. However, as Karen wrote, our hightest priority at the moment is to release Scratch 2.0. Nevertheless, I do agree with general feeling that, even with some limitiations, Scratch on the iPad would be lovely. -- John P.S.

For me the hardware add-ons will be key and would hope that things like Lego Wedo will be supported on the Scratch port for rpi. I liked your examples very much however am worried that you want to focus on traditional programming skills using Scratch. I don't believe Scratch is the correct tool for that. For me the whole point of Scratch is the lack of a command line and focus on multimedia to ease and engage the learning process for children. I think a Scratch ""Hello World!"" program should be spinning and whirling coloured letters shooting around the screen accompanied by a fanfare of trumpets! Good luck with the article, Mark"3256	13198	Scratch on the Raspberry Pi	6/28/12 6:10	"I just joined ScratchEd. I'd been looking at it for awhile, but wanting to reply to Mark T's post was what finally spurred me to join. I was going to write exactly what Mark W said. The jist of the your MagPi article is kind of ""how do you do traditional CS in Scratch"". Now there is a place for that (I'll tell you about some ideas I've had in a minute) but for only the second Scrach article in the MagPi, I feel that it might be a bit on the dry side. Jaseman's Dizzy Cat / Crazy Drums in Issue 1 is much more in keeping with the ... Scratch ethos (for lack of a better word). I've been giving some Scratch lessons in my daughter's Year 4 class. The lessons were as follows: 1. Intro to Scratch, sprites, scripts, costumes, the ""say"" and ""change costumes"" blocks. I created a tiny program where the cat says ""I wish I was a dinosaur"", then it changes into a dino courtesy of an imported sprite, then says ""Hooray!"" Then I got them to do their own thing. 2. Stroytelling with Scratch. How to use backgrounds, sound, motion, and ""say"" to tell stories. In this case it was a ghost story. The cat is in some dark woods, along comes a ghost with a scary noise, cat screams and runs away (well, ""glides"" away, we haven't done animation yet). The idea of this lesson was that you have 2 or more sprites, and you have to make sure that you put the code that you want the two different sprites to execute in the scripts for those different sprites. This is something that some of the kids in the first lesson were trying to do, but couldn't figure out. Again, they were let loose on the computers to do their own thing. I have two more lessons planned, as follows: 3. Animation. I'm going to show them how to use the repeat loop, custume change, and more instrcutions to make a bat fly across the screen. My daughter has already started playing with this sort of thing at home, for example making people dance while playing cool music. 4. Question & answer, making choices. I'm going to show them a little program where the cat asks them where they want to go on holiday and how much money they have. If they have enough money then the background will change according to the holiday destination selected. Only here do they meet variables, user input, if'/then/else, and operators (<). This is the sort of thing that I think makes a better intro to Scratch than how to do traditional CS things in Scratch. Where the traditional CS things are really useful is in cross curricular activities, combining science and maths. For example, the Year 6s learn about some basic stats: mean, mode, median. Showing them how to implement this in Scratch is a good way to help them understand the stats themselves and how computers handle data. It's also cool to have real data that you yourself have harvested, for example using the Picoboard to record niose levels in your classroom. At least, I think... This is definitely an untested lesson plan!"3257	13198	Scratch on the Raspberry Pi	6/28/12 6:49	"Thanks Myra, for your detailed replies. It certainly sounds like you have some great ideas for teaching with Scratch. Just to give a bit of context for my ""article"" (by the way, the latest draft is a bit different, but still probably rather dry. It does have a game on it now!), I am a teacher in a UK high-school. Most of the kids I teach (and I am an English teacher, not an ICT specialist!) already have some experience of Scratch and what they've done is mainly the making of stories, animations and games. My agenda was always to use Scratch to explore basic programming ideas that might be useful to the students when they begin to learn Python (or whatever). The MagPi is written by volunteers, so the content depends pretty much on the interests of the contributor. I agree that there are lots of things that one can do with Scratch that are more ""Scratchy"" than my scripts (and more fun). I am stil a beginner at using Scratch. I'm sure the editorial team would be happy to publish material with a focus like the one you have taken, if you (or anyone else!) approached them. The idea about environmental data / input sounds amazing, by the way. I've certainly taken your comments on board. thanks mark :)"3258	13198	Scratch on the Raspberry Pi	6/28/12 6:59	"Thanks Mark, for your comment. I don't know anything about Lego Wedo, but the idea of connecting the Pi to external devices is certainly key. So far I've experimented a bit with the GPIO pins using LEDs and a switch, but that's all. I'm interested to read your comments on the article. As I said in reply to Myra (who made similar points), I do accept the criticism. I know the team at the MagPi is keen to keep running articles on Scratch and this month I ""stepped up"" to offer some material. I'm not sure if the editors will want me to continue. If they do, I'll certainly try to make my next article more fun. It's only fair for me to admit that one reason for the approach I took is my lack of experience as a Scratcher!

You've bravely given your email address in the article but I wondered if your racypy Scratch ID might be better as the projects could also be downloaded? My intention was not to criticize but more as a warning. I develop software but have recently started a computer club at my son's primary school. They are very quick to see the possibilities when you show them Scratch can play sounds and the sprites move and animate. Having got that attention then adding in logic and loops to futher control things is much easier than the opposite direction which is; here is a loop, here is some logic etc.. Your article has given me some ideas. I think the dice simulator is crying out for 6 costumes representing each side of a die and that wonderful sound as dice bounce across a table top. That's why I didn't want to be negative as that is what the article should be doing. As for my virtual Pi it was a virtual box ovi file from February so probably a bit dated.

Your project plotting the distribution of numbers you get from the die is exactly the sort of cross-curricular thing I was talking about... Nice link with maths there! Here's a Scratch science project I've done for myself that would be really cool to do with some kids sometime... I grabbed a thermistor from the shed (doesn't everyone have a collection of electronics in their shed? -- my hubby does electronics for a living and occasionally as a hobby), froze it into an ice cube, attached it to one of the analog inputs of a Picoboard, then plotted the restistance (which corresponds roughly to the temperature). This is the resulting graph: The horizontal blue line is about 0C; the ticks along that line are the hours. I love this graph. It shows clear as can be that the temperature remains pretty much constant while the ice is melting, and only then once it's all melted does the termperature climb again, asympotically approaching room temp. Yes, you can do real science with Scratch!"3272	13198	Scratch on the Raspberry Pi	6/30/12 17:42	"Ha, too much indentation in my post below, you can't see my lovely melting ice graph! Here it is, unindented..."3273	13198	Scratch on the Raspberry Pi	7/1/12 6:09	"Excellent! I'll have a look at your Scratch page! Yes, I do find Scratch strangely addictive ..."3274	13198	Scratch on the Raspberry Pi	7/1/12 6:11	This is a really great idea. I wonder if I could do something similar using the GPIO pins on the Raspberry Pi! mark3275	13198	Scratch on the Raspberry Pi	7/1/12 11:37	Agreed. Saw the post about the xbox kinect and Scratch which pointed me to the remote sensing protocol in Scratch. I'm sure that could be use ti access the GPIO pins with a small helper program. Might have to buy a rpi sooner rather than later. Would also  want to add a webcam with microphone. Have you tried any out to record pictures and sound in Scratch by any chance?3276	13198	Scratch on the Raspberry Pi	7/1/12 13:21	"Hi Folks, we have too much indentation below, so I've clicked the Post Reply button rather than replying to a specific post. Mark T wrote "" I wonder if I could do something similar using the GPIO pins on the Raspberry Pi!"" The answer is, yes you can. You would need an analog to digital converter. I have been working on the Gertboard, and conveniently, it has exactly such a device. I could easily solder up something that would allow me to connect a thermistor to the A/D inputs of the the Gertboard. So then I could collect the data using a C program. And then the question is how to plot it... It has been a long time since I did anything graphical in C, does anyone by any chance have any suggestions for a good library to use to allow me to plot a graph similar to the one I made in Scratch? I know how to do graphics in Python (well... I'm learning Python, and I know where to look to find out how to do graphics in Python), and I have a Python GPIO module, so I could do it in Python... except that the Python GPIO module code doesn't drive the SPI bus, and the A/D chip uses the SPI bus... So I'd have to figure out how to do SPI in Python. So I have to hand almost all the tools I need to duplicate this experiment on the Pi! Ah, I've just thought of a way I could do it: I could collect the data using a C program, then put it into a file, then in Scratch I could read the data from the file into a list, then I could plot the data in the same way I plotted the data collected by the Picoboard! Then I could do the whole thing on the Raspberry Pi. It would be more elegant to either (re)learn how to plot things in C, or how to drive the SPI bus in Python..."3279	13198	Scratch on the Raspberry Pi	7/2/12 14:18	Sounds great. Really like the thermistor stuff. Does the picoboard work with the raspbery pi? P.S.

Just wondering what they intend to do for schools as at the moment you can only order one per person?"3306	13198	Scratch on the Raspberry Pi	7/12/12 1:44	"I just thought I'd give you a preview of what I am working on for next Month's Scratch Patch. Like I have said, I am a beginner. This is actually the first Scratch project I've made that uses animation and sound. I would appreciate some feedback. On issue is that we are quite short of space in the Magazine (I only get 2 pages) so I will have to keep the project quite small. Anyway ... it's a (simple!) version of Frogger: EDIT - I've added some project notes. Thanks! mark"3307	13198	Scratch on the Raspberry Pi	7/11/12 12:10	I run a computer club at my son's primary school and the lego wedo proved a hit. Using external hardware would certanly be of interest. I need to order an rpi for myself and see if I can get the school interested in using it too. Any collaboration could well be of interest.3308	13198	Scratch on the Raspberry Pi	7/11/12 12:10	"This is excellent news Myra. I've mentioned the great stuff that the Scratch community are doing to the MagPi team. They are very impressed. I've posted a link to something I am working on for next month's magazine, I'll repost it here. If I can get my act together to do something that shows Scratch interacting with the outside world, I will definitely write about it in the magazine. Frogger clone."3309	13198	Scratch on the Raspberry Pi	7/12/12 5:34	"I just had a lesson with some Y8 students in which I showed them my frogger game and told them about the RPi foundation's competition. Then I let them choose to improve my game or make their own. I was impressed with what they did. I'm an English teacher so I don't often get the chance to do this. They had done some Scratching before, but I'm not sure how much. Anyway , most of them seemed to get the idea pretty quickly (quicker that I did!) :)"3310	13198	Scratch on the Raspberry Pi	7/12/12 6:17	"Just had a go with your Frogger. It's good! The sound effects are excellent. Just a few suggestions: Arrow keys are easier to use than letter keys (maybe use left arrow for left, right arrow for right). The frog sometimes ends up under the log rather than on top of it. Under looks there is a ""go to front"" block which would probably sort the program. Maybe a better picture of a frog? But then I'm so not an artist that I feel I really have no right to complain about this!! Anyway, it's nice. It's basic, but this is a good thing: it sets them thinking ""hey, it would be better if..."" and then they start to look into how they can make it better."3311	13198	Scratch on the Raspberry Pi	7/12/12 10:27	"Thanks Myra, I'll change the keys. I'll have a look for that ""go to front"" block, I haven't used it before. I have had a go a re-drawing the frog. I'm not much good at art ... I do need to keep it simple as anything that looks much nicer would take up quite a bit more room in the magazine. Although I have realised how to use a background instead of sprites for the ""water"" and ""river-bank""!! mark"3314	13198	Scratch on the Raspberry Pi	7/16/12 16:51	"Instead of drawing a frog, why not use  the 2 scratch cat sprites? Changing the costume makes it look like he's waliking. You can call it Scratcher instead of Frogger! Well ordered the raspberry pi and now have to wait 11 weeks! So should get it for halloween!"3315	13198	Scratch on the Raspberry Pi	7/12/12 16:45	Just downloaded to look at the scripts and yes you need to use the stage background and just have sprites for the logs and frog.3321	13198	Scratch on the Raspberry Pi	7/16/12 10:21	"Hi Mark, Yes, I realised that I should use a background. I had not got around to updating my Scratch file. Like I said, I'm a beginner ..."3407	13198	Scratch on the Raspberry Pi	8/2/12 9:13	Issue 4 of Magpi out now. Well done with the Frogger game.3479	13198	Scratch on the Raspberry Pi	9/16/12 4:11	"I now have a raspberrypi! One thing that hasn't been mentioned here but is a topic on the raspberrypi forum is the performance of scratch on the raspberrypi or rather lack of. As it stands, its not a combination I could recommend. What are others thoughts?"3488	13198	Scratch on the Raspberry Pi	9/18/12 15:47	"Hi Mark, Sorry I haven't been on here and answered your posts. Glad to hear you have a Pi. As I guess you have seen if you go on the RPi forums, there is some discussion going on about the performance of Scratch. As far as I know, nothing major has been done yet. I did try to recompile Squeak from source, but I ran into a heap of problems and gave up. I will probably have another go at some point. But really it needs the Scratch developers to sort something out ..."3493	13198	Scratch on the Raspberry Pi	9/22/12 12:55	That's ok. Not sure Scratch is the problem I think the VM needs some work and JITing it would be just what's needed. Started looking at it myself but its not within my skillset...at the moment!3505	13198	Scratch on the Raspberry Pi	9/29/12 17:07	"Thanks Mark, sorry I haven't replied until now. The October issue will feature a little Bubble Sort program. I have also been having fun with Scratch with my GCSE computing group - we've done a program to convert denary to binary, and one that does Hex."3506	13198	Scratch on the Raspberry Pi	9/30/12 4:08	Look forward to that. Have checked out the convertors and you need to add a test for negative numbers and fractions!3517	13198	Scratch on the Raspberry Pi	10/4/12 1:13	"Hi Mark, Thanks for you feedback on the binary and hex converters. I don't think I know how to do that yet! I need to brush up on my understanding of two's complement and floating point numbers in binary! mark"3518	13198	Scratch on the Raspberry Pi	10/4/12 13:54	Was thinking more of defensive programming so detecting a negative number or fraction and asking user to re-enter a positive integer.3519	13198	Scratch on the Raspberry Pi	10/5/12 2:55	"Hi Mark - yes, I see what you mean. That would be sensible. However, I want to tackle the more complex side of binary representation at some point. I am teaching GCSE computing and I have been using Scratch to ease my Y11 students into programming.  Most of them had used it a bit to make animations etc, but not really to create more ""traditional"" programs. Thanks for your comment!"4415	13198	Scratch on the Raspberry Pi	1/3/14 3:06	"I'm about to ask for Raspberry Pi & Arduino kits as a DonorsChoose project.

Raspberry Pi only runs Scratch 1.4 which does support Wedo out of the box although I have only ever used it on a Windows machine and not the Raspberry Pi. So I'd expect it to work but am not 100% certain as haven't tried that.4584	13198	Scratch on the Raspberry Pi	4/6/14 17:13	"So, I finally got the R-pi and have confirmed that the Raspbian distribution works with the LEGO WeDo system just fine. Yay! However, not so much luck with the laptops I tried. Boo. (I installed the Ubermix [Ubuntu] distro on 2 old-ish Dell Latitude D610's, and the WeDo USB connection does NOT seem to be working/recognized on either laptop. The special blocks do not appear in Scratch, nor does any sensor or motor work, even if I make the blocks appear by using the menu, then put them in a program. And yes, I tried all of the USB ports.)

Using the course software and keeping the posts personal might allow students more comfort in sharing their reflections.

The students could follow them exactly as written, but got extra points for personalization. At the beginning, for most kids, that means playing with beats, music, and drawing tools, which most teens like. The more motivated kids personalized the programs in more sophisticated ways. I didn't do much explicit teaching at first, but began incorporating 5 min. Do Nows to review the use of certain blocks and logic structures, which allowed me to teach certain things they were having trouble with. After a couple of projects, I assigned them an open-ended design project. They work in pairs or individually, by their own choice. The kids have really taken their own interests and incorporated them into the projects, and most are at least moderately engaged. I have posted my Do Nows in the resource section, and could share other stuff if desired. I hope that helps! One continuing challenge is that the kids work at wildly different speeds, so figuring out when to set firm deadlines for finishing projects is tough."3797	14130	Teaching Scratch to uninterested teens	1/27/13 20:50	"You must be a excellent teacher. You give great advise. I will make use of your tips. I didn't know about shallwelearn.com, thank you for that. I have experimented in different ways with my students to interest them in learning Scratch. The best results I got was with a maze game assignment which made them want to get the sprite through the maze. I too find it necessary to limit the amount of  time spent on the exercises. I love your idea of an open-ended design project. The key I think is in allowing them to develop their own ideas. It is better to not be too controlling. Thanks again Kelly for you help."3798	14130	Teaching Scratch to uninterested teens	1/28/13 22:02	My students love the Dance Party activity that was just mentioned by Michelle Chung. It really gets the kids up and moving and ties programming to something the students can relate to. One thing that motivated my students was to have them create games for a special education classroom. The difference in the quality of work went way up when they realized that they were not creating something just to get a passing grade. They loved the idea that they were creating something that would be used by other students.3578	14163	Students Frequently asked questions during Scratch lessons	10/12/12 8:25	Do any teachers have any comments about using Scratch in the class?

One third of the class finds my pace too slow (and wants more challenges—which I try to give individually), another third find it too fast (and wants more explanations—which I try to give/repeat to the entire group whenever I can) and the final third seems to find my pace to their liking. 2. Some students want me to solve every problem for them (which is not going to happen). 3. Errors are bound to appear in some student projects because of the way a student used their blocks. I try to have other students help problem solve, because it can be time intensive. 4. I require my students to spend time creating sprites and backgrounds, which can give me some time to analyze code. 5. Unknown errors will appear and disappear in some student projects for no logical reason."3777	14163	Students Frequently asked questions during Scratch lessons	1/16/13 12:17	I actually teach Scratch in an after-school club.

I just created a test project ""Blumenwiese"" testing parameterized custom blocks. It worked!! Small things: - in IE, the ""see inside"" button doesn't work (when I click on a project thumbnail, I get to the project page, but then I can't get to the scripts). So I used Chrome, and that worked. - I was looking for a save button for some time until I realized that there is some autosave going on, and occasionally, I see ""projects needs saving"". Same with notes/credits. Fine with me, but it takes some getting used to. - when I clicked on Make block for the very first time, no define-block template appeared and I was stuck. Only when I accidentally clicked on costumes and then on scripts again, the template suddenly appeared. From then on, it always appeared after making a block. - when the project was ready, I clicked on share, but on the project page it still said ""not shared"" over the stage. Only when I got to the page next time through my stuff, it appeared as shared. - the button for ""my stuff"" is tiny, and I didn't recognize it as the ""my stuff"" button. I found it by try and error (tooltip would help). - when I changed the language from English to German, a custom block parameter named ""color"" was autotranslated to ""Farbe"". This kind of localization is a bit too much, I think. Also, when I changed back to English, the parameter itself went back to ""color"" but its use in the custom block definition remained ""Farbe"". That's it for now - I'll keep testing! Bernd."3646	14768	Questions and Suggestions for the Scratch 2.0 Alpha	11/3/12 13:48	"Yes I was Scratching, pardon the pun, my head last night for a while as I couldn't get back to the editor using IE 9 as ""See inside"" doesn't work. Chrome also has problems as  ""See Inside""doesn't work occasionally on that. It makes the whole process really hard to get into a project and edit it. ""Create"" confusingly for me just dumps you into presentation mode with the Scratch cat and a large green flag but not the editor."3647	14768	Questions and Suggestions for the Scratch 2.0 Alpha	11/3/12 15:13	"OK, I still don't understand how saving/editing works. I have this shared test project, and now I update it by deleting one script. I see ""Save needed"" but don't click on it. After some more clicking in the interface, I see ""Saved at 19:47:52"", and clicking on the green flag indeed shows the effect of the update. But when I click on ""my stuff"" and from there go back to the project, I'm still seeing the old version before the update. Which is good, since I don't want autosave to mess with my shared stuff. But how do I now share the update? And how do I store intermediate changes during the update process, for example when I need to logoff and want to continue later?"3648	14768	Questions and Suggestions for the Scratch 2.0 Alpha	11/4/12 8:06	"I'm enjoying trying out Scratch 2.0! Here are a few things I've noticed: The clone blocks are very useful - I can really see people making great use of these. I like the higher resolution of the graphics. The backpack is incredibly useful for sharing sprites bewteen projects. This used to be a laborious process before. I can see this being very useful in a classroom situation. The saving process is not obvious at the start. There is obviously some autosaving going on, but there is no prominent save button. Perhaps it's a bit old fashioned but I like the old style disc icon to click when I've got something to work after a while. It sort of marks the end of that bit of the project and, after clicking, I know I can move onto the next bit, secure that my work is saved! I also noticed (See Mark Willis post) that the Create button takes me straight to the full screen presentation mode. However, if I go to one of my projects and then click See Inside it works fine. Then I can click on New and I get the proper editor view with all the blocks etc. (This was using the up to date Google Chrome) I'll keep testing!"3649	14768	Questions and Suggestions for the Scratch 2.0 Alpha	11/4/12 12:10	"I tested recursion with custom blocks (Fibonacci numbers) - it works! The only unfortunate thing is that there are no custom reporters which makes the code a bit cumbersome. Also, have comments diappeared? I can't find them anywhere, and loading a Scratch 1.4 project from disk renders them as a red (obsolete?) blocks. I'll keep testing! Bernd."3650	14768	Questions and Suggestions for the Scratch 2.0 Alpha	11/4/12 16:24	"I noticed that the German translations of blocks and their categories are incomplete. For blocks / categories that have been present in Scratch 1.4, one should simply choose the old German names. For new blocks and categories, I don't know whether names have been discussed / decided yet. Here's the natural proposal for some of them: - Data -> Daten - More Blocks -> Mehr Blöcke - Events -> Ereignisse - create clone of ... -> erzeuge Klon von ... - delete this clone  ->  lösche diesen Klon - clone startup -> Klon-Aktivierung - stop all / this script / other scripts in sprite - > stoppe alles / dieses Skript / andere Skripte dieses Objekts I'm happy to help with translations of others, if needed. While going through all this, I noticed that the actual blocks shown in the alpha differ from what the ""How Do I Use the New Blocks?"" section says. Most notably, the backdrop capabilities seem more rstricted than what the scene blocks advertise (for example, there's no ...and wait feature). Are the alpha blocks supposed to be the Scratch 2.0 blocks, or are there still changes to be expected?

You get two identically named blocks in 'More Blocks' area (both of which call the first code you created). You can delete the duplicate by right-clicking. You can delete the definition of a block by right-clicking and pressing delete, even if it has been used in the script. You cannot delete it by dragging it into the script block area if it is in use. You don't seem to be able to drag code into the stage script area from a sprite Will it be possible to make a defined block available to all sprites: I have written a 'walk' block but can't let other sprites use it.

For a game, I used a loop with ""move 2 steps"" and ""wait 0.01 sec"". In 1.4 it takes the sprite about 6 seconds to move across the playing area but only 4 seconds in 2.0. Did anyone else experience this?? 2. I really like the ability to make the scripts larger and smaller, but how about the blocks themselves? It's not as critical but it would be nice. 3.

As far as I could see, Scratch does not support ""folding"" or ""hiding"" the code for new blocks. We have middle-school kids writing projects with dozens of scripts per sprite, some of them very long. It is often impossible to read and understand them and I dread to think what would happen if someone tried to maintain such a project after it wins a prize on Scratch Day. I was hoping that Scratch 2 would use ""Make block"" as a way of supporting the structuring of programs. PLEASE, please do something! 2. BYOB supports creating functions returning boolean <...> or number (...). Very nice to have but not essential. 3. BYOB supports remote call of a ""procedure"" in another sprite. There is an easy workaround by broadcasting a message and calling the block when it is received so I don't see this as necessary. 4. Something didn't look right and I tracked it down as resulting for my changing the center of rotation of a sprite. I guess that this is to be implemented in the future.

If things go wonky that is an opportunity for you to learn the debugger....Throw a debug block at the top of your execution chain and when you run you will be dropped in to the debugger (ok, no fancy breakpoints, inspectors, manipulation, in fact it is a pretty sad little debugger, but it is better than nothing at all!) The button on the left is ""run"" which is basically your ""I'm done button"".  The one on the right with the arrow pointing to a flat line is your ""step into"" and it is your bread and butter (later on you may see a double chevron to the right of that which is your ""step over/out"" which will allow you to jump over blocks you have created, but I do not wish to confuse things so ignore that for now) The arrow pointing to the line is the one we will be using...each time you click it, it will show you a block of code and then it will drill down to the inner most function call/variable... When you reach the inner most value it will show it on the screen twice.  The first time is so you know what block is being evaluated, the second time is after evaluation.  If you click the variables button, it will allow you to inspect local variables by placing your mouse over the variable name in the list and waiting for a little popup with the value inside.  if a value has just been evaluated, at the top there will be a ""report value"" and a mouseover there will give you the evaluated result. It is a little confusing at first when it jumps inside a block you created (like the for loop), but if you play with it a bit you will get comfortable with it.  You can easily follow the flow to determine why your loop is never ending (Did you not use a negative number in your ""change variable by n"" block?) You should be able to see that kind of error here. Good luck! Al"3858	14992	Color - Finding out the code numbers	2/17/13 14:28	"Thanks again Al- Had fun watching the debugger. The problem I encountered was with the Tutorial Author's use of the ""The Block"" in his video. Quite simply, I could never get it to work using the Call() as described in the video because I FAILED to put the ""repeat until call(test)"" in , just a ""Repeat until (test)"". My Bad :( I used an alternative method for my students that didn't require ""The Block"", and moved on, but backed up and showed them this way also. A minor problem that test subjects in my highschool class encountered was trying to understand exactly what the ""run[action]"" actually did. That helped me to some extent, because I could then explain that the ""Actions"" were going to be all of the commands that would eventually reside inside of the For Loop C-Block that this code generates, and the current value of ""i"" would be passed to those commands upon each iteration. It also gave me a chance to demonstrate what happens if you switch the order of the ""run[action]"" and ""set (i)"" commands. Life is Good, sometimes better if fully understood ;-)"3874	15040	Looking for Science and Social Science teachers using Scratch	3/4/13 12:38	"Hi, I'm a chemistry teacher just starting with Scratch. I'm going to be using it in class this week.

You might find parents interested to join in learning with their offspring, or parents able to volunteer to help others learn.  At a practical level, the offspring might have strong views on whether their parents should be involved, and of course adults may need some form of clearance before being able to learn or work with children.

So apart from your hotel you need something like € 9,80 for 10 rides on the public transport, meals or snacks in the evenening will be something like € 15 each. Most bars in Barcelona serve small sandwiches which cost you something like € 1,50 each. We're close to 200 people registered. I wouldn't mind if it goes up to 250 or sells out at 320.

The Tamika script has two scripts for each letter sprite both of which are activated when the green flag is clicked. One sets the intial position (go to x:  y:  ) in a line at the top.

I spend only one week teaching the kids to develop their own artwork.  It is enough time to become familiar with the tool and to give them a taste of exercising their artistic muscles.  BYOB/Scratch is not the right tool for learning this discipline.  If I were to devote more time, I would teach them to use Photoshop, Illustrator, and/or Gimp.  BYOB provides an interesting mechanism for using created graphics, but a poor tool for creating them. The course I teach is a course in software engineering.  I try to expose the kids to a wide variety of information which focuses on software engineering.  As I mentioned before, this includes a week of drawing sprites as I see this being an important part of development, but in addition to the basics, I dive into recursion, artificial intelligence, algorithmic complexity, software testing, etc.  In addition, I use other tools to dip into web development, database development, etc...  I also spend a week developing sound effects for which BYOB/Scratch has a record button but no editing/modification features so I have to introduce another tool there (Audacity). We spend a significant amount of time collaborating on projects with different teams developing pieces of programs which are consumed by the group.  I also have them develop code within frameworks that allow them to focus on the concepts we are trying to learn.  Leveraging the work of others is critical to developing software which exceeds human capability to develop in a reasonable time frame, if at all... How many man-hours are represented by any of the applications you run today? I introduce them to free resources on the web for sprites and sounds and recommend they use them/modify them as needed.  I want to expose them to a variety of concepts from which they can take more specialized courses in the future.  In the end my goal is for them to learn to write basic programs (which in BYOB thankfully is a lot of fun video games) and to become familiar with the tools needed should they wish to pursue other avenues for career interest. So I guess the short answer is (too late, I know) I do not think it is a bad idea to teach the kids to leverage the work of others for the sake of learning programming.  On the contrary, I think it is critical to their success."3840	16272	Sacrificing aesthetics for the sake of learning to program	2/12/13 11:20	Looking back at the goal of the course I now see how it is ok to use the already created sprites and stages.3841	16272	Sacrificing aesthetics for the sake of learning to program	2/12/13 11:21	"Dear Al, Thank you for your thoughtful reply.  Now looking back at my question, I feel that it is ok to allow my students to utilize the sprites and stages that others created because it gives them more time to program, which is the ultimate goal of the program.  I will follow your lead in using the beginning of the course to teach the ways to use the various drawing tools then after that we will mostly use our time to program. My students will be using computers for the first time and as a matter of fact it might be the first time that they have ever seen a computer so I want to keep my lessons focused and simple.  I need to be careful not to overwhelm them or intimidate them with my course. When teaching your course do you use a projector to demonstrate how to create a game?  The classrooms for this course will not have projectors so I am trying to think of other ways to help the teachers explain how to move blocks around without them having to go to each student individually.  Do you have any suggestions? Flash cards?  Felt boards with movable pieces? Do you have any of your students games posted on Scratch? I really appreciate your advice and I look forward to hearing from you!

Thank you! Tiffany4044	16272	Sacrificing aesthetics for the sake of learning to program	6/23/13 15:18	"As a first time Scratch teacher myself, I think it's OK to use canned sprites, get 'em going on the simple logic programming, then steer the kids to a more customized stage background. You didn't mention the student's grade & class size, do you feel they're mostly budding artist ? Or geeks &hackers to-be ? I think we're all guilty of teaching what we know.  Being a software developer myself, I naturally lean on the programming & logic side of teaching.  To be honest, Scratch drawing tools isn't that great ... Video game design is a field right-down-the-middle, Maybe you can guide them with story book outline, skeatch out the game board & sprite interactions, get small pieces working, then go back & pretty it up on asethics."3832	16301	Paste some script into a discussion post - colour codes again	2/10/13 7:34	"Do the save picture of scripts and then open the file you saved in ""paint""....

Expecting to test for it as a condition is not natural as you can't guarantee that the condition would be executing when the event is broadcast hence the need for a variable to store the fact that an event has happened. I'd even go as far to say that the condition would always be false and so the repeat would never end without using a variable. It would be the ultimate race condition and so not something that would be implemented.3899	16574	Help Wanted: Scratch Instructor to teach grades 2-7	3/19/13 18:47	"Hi Yin, Have you gotten any responses yet for the position?

You might be interested in checking out this Hangman game assigment and rubric posted by a fellow HS Scratch educator - http://scratched.media.mit.edu/resources/hangman-game-project-and-grading-rubric. I could also imagine other types of projects like stories, simulations, or interactive art, that might include some of the programming concepts you mentioned. If there are particular concepts that you have in mind, you could also pose the project assignment based on those items. For instance, what if you gave the students a list of the concepts/blocks/requirements you would like them to exercise in the Scratch project, but leave the genre and project theme open? Would love to hear more about what you decided to do! M"3911	16775	Good project for HS students?	3/24/13 16:16	"Omar, Scratch is great for introducing and reinforcing so many programming concepts. Here are some ideas from the ScratchEd community: 1. Design an interactive pencil that wears down and draws thicker lines as it writes (animation with costume changes) 2. Create a magic 8 ball that shakes and answers questions (lists, variables and random numbers) 3. Design a project using only an orange circle and purple square With each of these projects you will be amazed at the variations and how quickly students learn the concepts independently. If your time is limited, assign the sprite creations for homework or limit the number of sprites. Scratchers get easily drawn in to the sprite and background designs."4023	16775	Good project for HS students?	6/5/13 8:01	"I recently created a Hangman game and I found it surprisingly complex in Scratch and I required a few workarounds. There might be simpler approaches (I was using a different sprite for each letter, and so had to convert letters into costume numbers via a list) but I'm not sure it's ideal for beginners. I'll take a look at that resource Michelle has recommended to see how they did it! :-) Scratch takes care of collision detection which is hard in many other programming languages, so Scratch is well optimised for making arcade style games, and there's a lot of latitude in how sophisticated they can be, so students can tailor their game to their own level of expertise and curiosity. An arcade game might be the obvious thing to try. I ran a session for adults recently where I got them to write a game where balls bounce around randomly, and the cat has to dodge them. That had quite a small scope but still provided a reasonable challenge to them. It took them about an hour to do, using a guided worksheet that gave hints and tasks. Quite simple things can pose a challenge too. I got my group to work out how to draw a circle, after showing them the drawing tools and the repeat tool. That required the kind of creative thinking that programmers routinely do, and proved quite challenging as a warm-up."3922	17060	Suggestions for intro to CS with scratch for 1st and 3rd graders	4/1/13 14:16	"Hi Matthew, I'd love to hear how the session planning is going.

I was amazed at how quickly the 1st graders caught on.  The 3rd graders progressed even faster, and we eventually gave them a challenge task of making a sprite move through obstacles (using commands for arrow buttons, and then autonomously).  An alternate challenge was to create a conversation between 2 or more sprites. The 3rd grade teacher is planning to use Scratch to teach cartesian coordinate system, and maybe some other math concepts. It was a very rewarding day for me and great for the kids.  I think about half of them downloaded the program at home.  I'm glad I found out about Scratch - what a great way to introduce programming to kids.

It sounds like both you and the students enjoyed experimenting with Scratch. I love the idea of giving the students challenges/obstacles to explore other blocks and scripts. Teaching cartesian coordinates in Scratch is a useful one, especially using the ""Glide to"" block.

So far, there have not been any real problems doing that. especially with Scratch 2.0 . I suppose that students could hack one another's accounts and disrupt things in other ways, but it has not happened and I'll cross that bridge when I come to it.  Meanwhile, life is easy doing this. When we first started doing Scratch, some parents did express some concerns.  That was a bit tense, but I ended up making up a permission slip and giving each parent and child the option of opting out or just using special one-time accounts within the classroom.  However, at that point, all of the parents gave permission to do things as I had outlined and we've just gone on from there. I think the really big factor that makes this work is the amount of thought and effort the Scratch team has done to make this a safe constructive environment for kids.  The recent additions to make sure credit is given for remixing projects is just one more step in that directions.  Kudos.

Most online email services require a child to be 13 to get an account. This is probably due to concerns over the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA). Parents don't have very many good options for getting kids email below age 13 unless they own their own website and control the ability to create email accounts. I am preparing for an online Scratch class that will be delivered through a Webinar primarily directed at homeschool kids, but open to anyone. I had the same concerns with getting kids access to Scratch 2.0 as well. My solution is to use standalone version of Scratch (1.4). The parents can download Scratch 1.4 for the kids. There is no need for an email address for the kids."4536	20444	Class management tool for Scratch	3/12/14 7:53	"That's great news, Michele.

Set up a class email account -- teachers can create a free class email account using Gmail and have all the students input that email when signing up. Get a parent/guardian to provide an email address -- this can be done by sending a note home about Scratch with the student. As you mentioned, using the downloadable version of Scratch is another option. I think it all depends on your situation and needs."4964	20444	Class management tool for Scratch	2/17/15 8:53	"Still waiting and eagerly anticipating this. I still hope for the following: 1. Classroom management implies identification/authorization. The only way this is possible without the teachers becoming manual admins for this (which should not be their role), is to use  a login from the school. My suggestiomn would be to allow google-IDs, it will also eliminate problems with age for private accounts. It will also give the freedom to still use private accounts for those that have no school-systems. 2.

Class Locker is a cloud-based class management tool for K-5 which lets students store and share a wide range of files, including the .sb and .sb2 formats used by Scratch.  While this does require an extra step for students to download from the Scratch Editor then upload to Class Locker, it offers a number of benefits: Class Locker ""student cubbies"" are provisioned by the teacher without the need for student emails. No need to create Scratch accounts for students. Walled garden controlled by teacher so students don't get random posts from people outside the classroom. Scratch projects can be included within a central student portfolio rather than a Scratch-specific silo. Parents can ""subscribe"" to all of their child's projects in one step, and receive project updates by email. If you'd like to take a spin for your classroom, visit classlockers.com and click Teacher, then Teacher Registration to sign up.  Use the Promo Code scratched to enable Scratch files.

Personally, I think the burden of having to remember extra accounts (specfically for one puppose, like scratch) is bound to be frought with problems. Scratch itself should allow integration with accounts that schools already have (this would also eliminate 13+ problems). Ideally group-management would be supported too. Google-apps integration would be great, but a moodle-plugin could do the trick too, perhaps? Personally, I'd go for Google in a flash."5051	20444	Class management tool for Scratch	4/7/15 19:32	I would like to see Google Apps connection as well.

Each children would select a song, get the lyrics (both download from internet) and program a sprite (also they could download photos of the singers) to move, change apariences and control the speaking (music and lyrics together). In this way, they could create their own video-clip, a real final product ready to show and share with others. Probably when the children go back home, they will try to develop new versions or new video-clips and they would want to know more about Scratch, how to insert different effects, movements, ... they would be inside the creative spiral. Perhaps, would be a great idea to offer them a way to attend questions after the workshop finished. Also, before the workshop, you can comment to children that they have to select a song with the lyrics. There they will learn to make video-clips they could share in internet.

Some examples I've seen educators use is a school name + anonymous student number convention such as SchoolName1, SchoolName2, or SchoolName_Student1, SchoolName_Student2. You might also have each student create a profile using their name, for example, SchoolName_StudentName (ie: RydellHigh_MichelleC). Have you considered students creating their own usernames? It be nice if students could design and personalize their own account name, especially if you expect that students might want to continue working on Scratch projects beyond the class.

But the student also needs a way to tell the monkey the direction the platform is moving in so the monkey can move along the X axis with the platform.  One way is to use ""set x to"" in the same if/then block, but instead of using a numerical value for x you want to use the x position of Green Ledge--fortunately there's a block in the SENSING group of blocks which ""senses"" the value of various parameters for each sprite in a project. [I remixed the orginal project and made these 2 code changes here: http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/12981133/] Depending on the student's learning style, it might be a good idea to just give them one of the above solutions, perhaps just the Y fix, then see if they can figure out how to adjust X on their own.  Then they can transfer those solutions to the other platform(s). Once mastered, you could challenge them to set a hotspot for the feet so the feet must touch the top of the platform for the monkey to land on it.  And/or a platform that hits a monkey in the chest might send them tumbling rather than pulling them up/onto it.  For an older student add a bit of physics in the form of acceleration as they are falling."4229	22880	Platform Game Help	10/5/13 21:05	"Also helps to increase the speed of falling, perhaps ""change y by -5,"" otherwise it's hard to get past the green platform once you've landed on it."4230	22880	Platform Game Help	10/7/13 3:16	"Thanks Derek.  Great help.

I hope the material will be made available outside of the US. I think there would need to be number of activities depending on age range and ensure that part of the time is spent explaining what has been achieved at the end of the session. Would expect some very simple game for U10's (e.g. very simple maths e.g. what is 2+3?), a little more advanced for U13's and maybe something to control something e.g. turn on a motor or LED for older children. All achievable using Scratch (of course :-) ). Clearly the material to be used needs to be 'road-tested' and suitable for use on different equipments (not just PCs, MACs, but also machines such as RaspberryPI and tablets). There also need to be enough supporters to help as the poor teacher won't be able to cope on their won. When I have done 'hour coding sessions with 9/10 year olds, I find that the ratio of at least 1 supporter for 5 children is essential. This ratio can increase for older children but it does depend on the ability of the students."4234	22891	Hour of Code Ideas	10/10/13 0:04	"I'm still a big fan of Scratch Cards. . . I had great success with 9th/10th graders using the following strategies: Have previous/experienced Scratch student open with brief project presentation. Either student or instructor gives cursory intro to the Scratch interface. Group students in clusters of 4-5, one student per laptop. Students are given 2 minutes to create account, start new project and choose one sprite at random. Each group given 4-5 different Scratch cards. Announce they have 2 minutes to try out the block/technique on their card. After 2 minutes yell, ""Switch,"" and they all pass their card and add new block to their project. Do this 4 times then yell, ""Scratch."" Now instead of switching cards, students move to the next computer and modify that person's project. After 4 ""Scratches"" everbody returns to their seats to check out what has become of their original project. If time permits, do gallery walk and/or ask for volunteers to present their Scratched Scratch project. Ticket to go is adding their project to a Scratch Studio created for that specific class. Can broaden by having a grade- or school-wide studio. My goal in developing the above procedure was to immediately engage students, filter the possibly overwhelming block-based coding environment into just 1 block at a time and focus their energy on coding rather than spending 20 minutes browsing canned-clipart.  The shifting of seats not only keeps things lively, but also removes some of the attachment to project outcome, as well as physically demonstrating the idea of collaboration and remixing."4241	22891	Hour of Code Ideas	10/23/13 7:34	"I have middle schoolers in a semester long class.  Some are currently avid Scratchers.  I'm wondering how to use them as resources to teach the other students.  I like Derek's idea and maybe I could send them each out with a pack of cards and directions.  I'm thinking of asking science or math teachers for a class period and they could have laptops for all their kids or pairs of kids. I like Karen's idea of starting with a 'this is possible' video. Currently, I use this one in class: http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=jxDw-t3XWd0 It's from the Starting_from_Scratch_LEARNER.pdf curriculum I have my students do for a couple of weeks as an intro. Of course, there's the problem of kids who already program in the class with non-programmers, but they could be resources.  Maybe a combination of ideas--total newbies use the cards, slightly familiar with use the 10 block challenge, others create a simple game in scratch or remix something with specific goals in mind. We have a a 7-12 grade American-style school and my kids are 7-8 grades.  We have some HSers who have done Scratch, but most haven't.  I'd like everyone to have a chance at it before they leave school, so the Hour of Code is a great way to start.  I'm also wondering what tutorials will be available at the Hour of Code site: http://csedweek.org/resource_kit/tutorial"4254	22891	Hour of Code Ideas	10/31/13 9:33	"Howdy folks, I'm glad to have stumbled across this thread (and Derek, glad to know that you're a part of it). I'm heading up efforts to help learners 6-18 at a very large network of afterschool institutions (sorry, can't name names in a Google-able thread!) engage in the Hour of Code, and wanted to share my perspectives on the space. Basically, we're hoping that staff at participating organizations are able to run hourlong sessions using Scratch, Kahn Academy or Code Academy. I know for a fact that, at many organizations, one or more staff have some familiarity with Scratch. This makes it a great candidate. However, their familiarity is entirely variable and their confidence in self-generating hourlong implementation objectives isn't a given. In general, their anticipation is that we (meaning me, from the HQ) can provide more specific guidance about how best to utilize Scratch in that one hour session. So, I've been looking forward to the outcome of this thread. With that in mind, here are some of the opportunities and constraints that I've seen: I've found the 'Scratch Cards' most helpful & hadn't know of their existence until this thread. Because the afterschool space tends to be a bit chaotic, I'd avoid 'switching stations' too frequently, or at all. Computer station audio is not a given, but it does exist. So we have to plan on scenarios that don't rely on instructional video, although instructional video could enrich the session. We could presume that instructors can step in if audio/video isn't a possibility. I love the idea of generating anew, particularly with a very concrete goal in mind (animate two objects), but also see the value of remixing (a different sort of tinkering). If the later, it would be awesome to use that experience to help entry-level Scratchers get a sense of [loco]motion and perhaps, even variables. I'd love to use this as an opportunity to shift the instructor - learner paradigm a bit. When a learner or group is struggling with a logic question, why not turn that to the class to resolve? Our educators don't always feel this empowerment (often try to answer the question themselves). What would an hour of using Scratch look like with a 1:2+ computer:learner ratio? From my vantage, goals for the hour include: Growing staff and learner familiarity with Scratch Teaching some of the basics Engaging learners in problem-solving of modest, reasonable complexity Describing how an understanding of Scratch can lead toward 'real-world' code tinkering Indicating a 'what next' (which might be very much specific to this organization) Which means that a session could: Introduce Scratch through brief dialoge w or w/o video (5 mins) Introduce an intiial simple problem (move from Point A to Point B) (10 mins) Introduce additional logic (loop to draw a shape) (10 mins) Apply in the context of a remix to solve a problem (e.g., Activate C when A hits B) (30 mins, fuzzy) Recap / Talk through challenges / solutions / what next (5 mins) So... those are some perspectives on my approach to the day and Scratch space. Perhaps it'll be helpful food for thought as the materials evolve? Here's to hoping so!

That said, and as others have commented on here, it has been a frustrating experience using Scratch 2.0 in a classroom environment. Creating a class Studio for projects is simply not working. As a result, we cannot see all of our projects in one place, and comment and critique them. Working in the cloud only (with Chromebooks), I am forced to have kids copy and paste links to their projects into an Edmodo group, where we can see each other's work and make comments. Very cumbersome. And with grades where I cannot use Edmodo, I am lost. I know the Scratch team is working on a Class Management tool, and I have to emphasize that tool cannot come soon enough. Please know this is not a trivial matter for educators using Scratch 2.0. We desperately want to use Scratch, but this Studio issue is really messing things up :( respectfully, Peter R."4286	23537	Ways for students to share their scratch projects	11/10/13 15:46	"Can I ask here if it would be possible to link the sharing to a Google-ID. Advantages: 1. Widely known, trusted, used. In education paticularly. 2. Allows Google-groups to be used for authroization. This allows both professional (with Google-apps domain) and private (free version of google-groups) usage.  If the authorization is chosen the way Zoho com does (allows signing in with a google-apps-domain ID without the domain admin having to authorize it, that would be great) 3. MIT already hosts appinventor which uses google-logins. So it should be known within the organization. 4.  It will still allow the core (scratch) to be hosted at MIT or anywhere. 5. Google has a good security reputation. 6. It could be advantageous to not have to share with the whole world. A student could be allowed to share work with just a teacher. This would involve changing the code, though. Possible disadvantages: 1. Avoid getting tied in to G+ for privacy reasons and it will exclude many domains/schools that do allow Gapps but not G+. 2. General privacy concerns. 3. Will require signup for Google-ID. 4. Exclusion of countries that block Google. Just my 2c. Y. added thoughts: Currently the way to see the work of a group of students is really only possible of the students make links to their publicly shared projects available. Ways of doing this? 1. email to teacher. (gets confusing) 2. Collect all links in one google-site or in a forumpost in a google-group or VLE. 3. Put them all in a doc (table) or spreadsheet in a doc that is shared with the group. Currently it is not possible to collaborate on programming, but that may be aiming to high. Since students can share IDs they can learn from each other, but could also copy parts from each other. In individual marking situations this is not an advantage."4292	23537	Ways for students to share their scratch projects	11/11/13 18:04	"I agree with your observations.  I have been able to create studios and have my students share their programs, but this only works when they are all done with their programs.  And once they share their programs, EVERYONE can see it, which starts to be a bit too distracting for the students. I have been doing pair programming, which I really like, but since students can't share an account it causes a problem when one of the students is absent.  I agree a Class Management tool is ideal.

I'm the editor of the book. Here's what I'd recommend--use the ""Blank"" versions of the projects. That way, you can focus on the programming, not adding files. Use ""File > Open"" (Scratch 1.4) or ""File > Upload from your computer"" (Scratch 2) to open a project file. The games are the files named .SB or .SB2 depending on which version of Scratch you're using. Scratch can't open the ZIP files, they need to be unzipped first. Hope that helps-- Tyler For Scratch 2 (the one on the Web): http://nostarch.com/download/Super-Scratch-2-Resources.zip For Scratch version 1.4: http://nostarch.com/download/Super-Scratch-Resources.zip Download those, unzip the game files.

I've begun to ask if there is a cognitive benefit, or a cognitive difference, in the construction and recognition of these typographic patterns, that renders them superior to other kinds of visual patternings.

It suggests that different imaginaries, or different imaginations, may be sparked or accessed by interaction with different tool kits. The argument echoes Clifford Geertz and Marshall MacLuhan's observation that humans shape and are then subsequently shaped by our tools. The link for the original is: http://fyprocessing.tumblr.com/post/69317286302/hamoid-my-first-animgif-programmed-in-nodebox and I quote it here in its entirety: My first animgif programmed in Nodebox. I still prefer code, but I see the advantages of Nodebox: Pause, play and rewind your animation. Go to the previous and next frames. Tweak values and modify your program *while it runs*. No need to stop and restart your program. This is great for experimentation. Export a range of frames. Export an mp4 movie or a vector PDF file. You can write your own modules in Python and Clojure. What I don’t like: No animgif nor gif export. Each time I export I must set the range and file format. Frame rate not so high. No access to the great collection of Processing libraries (midi, webcam, graphic tablet, OSC, etc). It’s great for people learning to code, and for those who don’t like typing code. It may also be great for sketching concepts, tweaking values and experimenting, to later port the idea to an environment that performs faster. Our creations are influenced by the tools we use. I suspect the kinds of creations we produce by typing code (Processing, Open Frameworks, SuperCollider) and by connecting nodes with wires (Nodebox, PD) can differ, the same way the kinds of results we get when using different programming languages can also be different. For instance, some languages  make it easier to write recursive programs. Other languages make it easy to work with big data sets, or with strings.

I'd say I wasn't a programmer, he'd argue that I could use Scratch, so I could program. Now I am student in Karen Brennan's class, and am thinking about this question in my final paper. I try and draw parallels to other things I know how to do, using iMovie is editing video but is not as powerful as using Final Cut Studio, but I'd still say they are both video editing. So, why, in my head is Scratch not programming or programming in the same sense but just lacks some of the capabilities of other languages. I think for me it has something to do with identifying as a ""programmer,"" but I am still trying to break that down. @Rafael, I am compelled by the idea of different environments supporting or leading to different potentials, that begins to take away some of the heirarchy between text and visual based programming. I wonder how many people on this thread do know how to program in a text based language.

The low-tech solution would be to give them a worksheet or index card on which they would hand-draw/write their block solution.  This may actually be more authentic to the professional programming world where paper-prototyping is a longheld practice.  You could even tie it in to Scratch Cards, so students may share their solutions with each other. However the easiest option I can imagine is having them take a screen capture (this blog entry shares how to capture just a portion of the screen on both Mac and PC so they could just show the blocks vs. full screen) and paste it into your assignment in Edmodo so you can scan them all quickly and even provide feedback or grade them within Edmodo.

Another option is to have young students create profiles at home with a parent or guardian providing an email. This could be assigned for homework with a letter home about Scratch and a place to fill in the chosen username and password -- so teachers can keep a master list on hand just in case a student forgets their account info.

We understand your frustration with the registration process for students, and we’re sorry for the difficulties that it has caused for you and your students. We’re continuing to work on Teacher Accounts, which we hope will simplify the process of creating accounts for your students. Unfortunately, the development of the Teacher Accounts has taken much longer than we expected. We hope to have more news about the accounts soon. We’ll make sure to post messages on ScratchEd to keep you informed. In the meantime, we suggest using a single email address (e.g., a teacher’s email address) to register and approve all of your student accounts. (Multiple Scratch accounts can share the same address.) We realize that the confirmation process can be time-consuming for educators, but confirmation is just a one-time process when first registering an account. Sorry again for the current difficulties.

That way, if a student posts any inappropriate content to the Scratch website, you will be notified. Maybe a #4 step would be to create a class list by having students post their username and a password hint in a shared Google Doc, spreadsheet, or using Google Forms, for students who want to find and friend each other or if a student forgets their username/password.

My idea of creating ""generic"" email addresses for students was assuming there was a catchall for @schooldomain that can forward to a central e-mail to approve/confirm the accounts.

To be honest, I haven't yet explored the site in full as I'm hopefully waiting for the ""student accounts"" to get set up before exploring.  I'm also wondering what would happen if I do move ahead with a workaround (create generic emails for each student) and then educator/student accounts is eventually enabled.  Would there be a good transition to move to those accounts?  Maybe there is an ""ideal workaround"" that is more seamless to transition to the educator/student accounts once enabled?"4989	25385	automated creation of Scratch accounts?	3/5/15 10:53	"I already use google-IDs to share information. I also have experience with sharing using google-groups (if you share to the email-addres to the group, all members of the group can acces the google-docs folders). In an ideal situation ID/Authentication/authorization management would not be organized by teachers, but teachers could just use the school-assigned IDs. For example: If a school happens to use Google-apps then the 13+ limit is irrelevant and you could share files to groups, and students could share back. I do not think teachers should be asigning all these IDs because they need to keep their own administration of IDs outside of the school's central administration. Students should be connecting at a higher level and teachers should be using existing IDs. Please note that I do not blame anyone for finding workable solutions, but I think it is just easier for teachers and better in the interest of the students to use IDs that are established elsewhere and just used by the teacher.

This is truly one of the best books I have reviewed. It contains many examples and projects that I can present to the students as a group, or have them try on their own. Some of the examples are simple enough to illustrate just enough of what I'm trying to teach (for example, how to use the Stamp tool), or lengthy enough to present as a challenge that encompasses multiple types of blocks or processes for a great learning experience. I appreciate the step-by-step projects and the visual guidance. If my classes were longer, I would certainly use this book as the ""text book"" to follow. As it stands now, my 6-week/once-per-week courses don't quite allow for that kind of depth, but I am able to extract many of the books samples to offer quite a lot of breadth into my courses. This book also really takes a Scratch user from the basic concepts of programming that is so available even to the casual Scratcher, to truly deeper concepts (such as nested loops, recursion, physics and advanced equations). I have yet to follow through with experiencing every page of this book, but my intent is to do so, as I'm certain it will put me in better shape to help my students and to develop my curriculum toward continually advancing my students' programming abilities and understanding."4506	25612	Student Accounts and Educator's Account	2/20/14 11:10	"Hi Sandy, Great question.

Once we , common teachers, realize of what happens inside our student's little heads  while they ""play"" with scratch and how this will improve their learning in other areas, then coding will take the role in deserves in the school curriculum.

So I envision starting this process by trying to hook my students with a cool application first (an animation, a game, etc...), and then eventually having them do traditional math things with it (graphing, plotting, etc...). Maybe we should form some sort of group for teachers integrating this into their classes, especially for the first time.

THe Scratchboard has 4 aligator plugins.    If you cunnect conductive objects to any of the ports, you can close a circuit.   For example, a Simon says kind of game: we glued tin foil to a popsickle stick and connected the aligator.   a small wooden flank can make the stick jumpy like a keyboard.

And the original suggestion made at the 2012 conference was to use the odd years for conferences on other continents. Thinking that way: Incheon (Korea) or Bangalore (India) would be great places to give much more Asians access to the nice event a scratchconference is. This, however will only work if someone from the area stands up and takes the lead. A lot of Europeans truly enjoyed the Barcelona conference and if a lot of people are in favour of another European edition I'm totally happy to take the lead. Another Citilab edition will benefit largely from the experience in 2013 and is a good option (I love the place!) Reaching out to Eastern parts of Europe is also a good idea. Places coming to mind: Berlin, Austria, Budapest, ... And then there's a third option mentioned by Brian Harvey: Berkeley, California. I assume such a place will be attractive to Asians, Americans and Europeans alike ..."4721	28696	Scratch 2015 conference	8/10/14 10:41	"Hi Joek --- Thanks for taking the initiative on this.

MIT already uses those for app-inventor. http://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/front.html 2. School-email-addresses are not limted to 13+ 3. In schoold that do no use google other email-addresses can be used to create google-account but that may raise the 13+issue. 4. After that google-groups or google+ circles can be used to manage groups and share folders.. 5. Reliable, widely used system. Mian advantage: for schools it can take away the burden of ID-management from the teacher and put it mainly with the school. After that teachers can just select groups and individuals.

Regards, Dave"5028	31976	United Kingdom	3/19/15 4:45	"Hi Dave, That's a great idea!  We need to decide what the aim of the meet-up should be.  Also, the Y & H Code Club coordinator Linda Broughton (@lindabroughton on Twitter) should be able to help as she'll have a list of CC volunteers and prospective volunteers who may want to come.  We had a York Code Club meeting last Thursday at Manor High School which was useful but was mainly about getting more CC volunteers. I love using Scratch with our CC at Bishopthorpe Primary but, sometimes, am not sure what direction to take next with the pupils and Scratch - so I need some collaboration with others to get good ideas. Could we use something like Doodle http://doodle.com/en_GB/ (possible attendees put their preferred dates & times into a calendar) to decide on a slot? I say this, because I find so often that I'm committed to something else on the date and time chosen, and I've also found using Doodle a great way to get people to definitely commit. About an aim.  Some hands-on use of Scratch, perhaps beyond what most of us are doing at present, would be great as I know the N STEM Ctre has suitable facilities. I loving coming there so I try to book myself a resource day as often as I can and attended a really good Raspberry Jam in the Autumn. Anyway, I think the idea is great and a lot easier than getting to MIT or Amsterdam!

This survey is part of a PhD research conducted at the Faculty of Education and Health at the University of Greenwich in London. The purpose of this research is to examine and discover how Scratch may be helpful in supporting English for speakers of Other Languages (ESOL) learners and programmes, and help ESOL students achieve higher levels of literacies. It should take around 5-7 minutes to complete this survey. Thank you for your contribution, your opinion is very important for us.

It was not easy:(4957	32228	Meeting quite a lot of problems :(	2/11/15 15:05	"Hi Sébastien, I'm sorry to hear that you're having problems using Scratch. Here are a few tips for these two issues you mentioned: - Sometimes the sprite goes off screen, while it (hopefully) still appears at the bottom of the screen. Yet I cannot bring it back on screen, all I can do is delete it with a right click. - I still miss a button that would bring the sprite back to its initial position (also cancel moves, rotations and special effects all at once) You can click on the ""go to x:0 y:0"" and ""point in direction 90"" blocks in the Motion category, which will move your sprite to the center of the screen and point it towards the right. Under the Looks category, the ""clear graphic effects"" block will clear all special effects such as color. These are also useful blocks to use to reset your sprites at the beginning of your project. You can do this by placing these blocks directly under the ""When green flagged clicked"" block to initialize your sprites' positions and looks each time you start your project. Regarding the other problems you are encountering, I would suggest that you write to the MIT Scratch Team to let them know you are having issues. I'm not sure if it's a browser issue, but if there is a bug with the Scratch interface, but they might want to know or have more information on how to resolve it. You can contact them at help@scratch.mit.edu. I hope that helps!

But sometimes, a bug can become a feature :) 2) Is the code doing it in the most efficient way possible (at the moment) This approach does seem to work so far :) Cheers, David"5140	36402	Scratch for autistic children	9/1/15 17:02	"Hi David, These are great questions. I think your approach of experimenting with different entry points and checking in often with the student to see what works for them is a good one. I've worked in inclusive classrooms with several students with autism and one thing I've found helpful to keep in mind is that each student with autism is as variable as any other learner (in terms of likes, dislikes, strengths and weaknesses). I wonder if some of the activities from the Creative Computing Curriculum Guide could be useful in this case. For example, you could sit with the student and let them click around the Scratch interface, seeing what happens as they click? Maybe you could look at a variety of projects (of their choosing) together and let them point out something they would like to be able to create or remix? For many students with autism, abundant choice and lack of structure is overwhelming, so perhaps an activity with constraints - like Ten Blocks (also from the CC guide) - would be a helpful place to start? A few other resources I found that might be helpful: Here is a brief discussion of the ways in which the Scratch online community can be helpful for some students with autism. Here is a ScratchEd Discussion about working with students with disabilities. Here is an article about programming and students with autism. Here is a list of tips for teachers working with students on the autism spectrum. I hope some of this is useful. I hope we can continue this conversation and keep sharing resources. Thanks, Willa"5143	36402	Scratch for autistic children	9/5/15 11:26	"Hi Willa, Pls forgive this tardy response, the articles and links provided were very helpful and I was looking through and trying to understand them.

But based on my experience, think that if you asked mother about special interest of her child. And create individual activity, it  can help. For example if he like pirates make the Scratch activities with use of pirates images."5148	36783	Scratch Site Availability & Performance Problems	9/18/15 11:57	"Hey everyone, it's Eric from the Scratch Team @ MIT.

To counter that objection, she recalled this old Jewish fable: A farmer visits his rabbi and says ""Rabbi, my house is too small. There is my wife with all her furniture and the kids with their pets, and the walls are closing in!"". The rabbi replies: ""You're a farmer, yes? You have pigs? Goats? Cows?"" The fellow nods, and the rabbi says: ""Move the pigs into the house."" ""What!?"" ""Just do it."" The man goes home, and following instructions, he moves the pigs into the house. And the next time he visits the rabbi, he says: ""Rabbi, these pigs are mucking up the place, and there is less room than before!"" ""Move the goats and cows into the house."" ""Huh?!"" the man says, but he actually returns to his home with his wife and her furniture, the kids and their pets, plus the newly-resident pigs, and he manages to stuff the other farm animals into the house. Again he returns to the rabbi, now with an escalated tale of woe and insufficient living space. The rabbi says: ""OK, move the farm animals back outside."" And when he returns the cows and goats, the farmer sees much more space in his home, though the pigs are still in it. He realizes that things aren't as bad as they seem, they can always get worse. -30- To me, that seemed like a fine story to tell her teachers who thought adopting Scratch would be the proverbial straw on a camel's back. But they continue to decline, she said. Then she tells me a related episode about introducing Alice to her students, some of whom were uninspired because they thought the Alice environment was too much to handle. But when Scratch entered the picture, those kids were pleased to find Scratch's UI less intimidating, and worked happily in her classs for the remainder of the year. I said: That's like my story. When I thought to start teaching programming, I looked for a teaching language to learn, but I couldn't deal with Alice. Then Scratch showed up, and I'm running with it. Then I realized that by giving up on Alice before embracing the less-weighty Scratch, her students and I were also farmers moving animals in and out of the house."5391	42312	"San Francisco Scratch Educator Meetup: Saturday, May 7, 2016"	5/9/16 11:44	"It was nice to meet so many different educators, however I would have liked to DO or MAKE more things.

If you created the accounts one by one, then the password is your Teacher Account username (they will be prompted to change this after logging in for the first time).

I don't really understand what that means, but I tried to do that with my test student by clicking Invite Curators and selecting that student and clicking Add but a message shows up saying that only members of the class can be curators. This person is already in the class but can't be added as a curator. I'm trying to figure out what the benefit is to using a Teacher Account versus just having the kids make accounts and share links with me. I thought these accounts would be easier to navigate and allow a teacher to give a course code or link to students who would then enroll in the class and all projects that students created would appear in that classroom. It seems there is an awful lot of set up required to get this working and I'm having trouble figuring it all out. I have many new students to Scratch and they are not happy about being forced to share their very beginner work with the universe. I get the whole Share with All thing but there should be occasions that teachers (especially of younger students) should be afforded the option to wall off their classes so kids are free to learn and experiment without doing it in public."5487	43921	Scratch Teacher Accounts now Available	9/13/16 14:25	"Hi Ann! Thanks for the post. Scratch Teacher Accounts are new, and our team is still working out the kinks - thanks to comments from people like yourself! Regarding your question about studios, all Student Accounts created within a class will automatically be added as curators for any studios created in that class. We have noticed a 10-15 minute delay in seeing these Student Accounts appear in the “curator” section of the class; perhaps this is what happened during your test? When we built Student Accounts, we made the decision to align these accounts with regular Scratcher accounts in many ways, including their relationship to the greater community. This was because we have seen time and again the importance of the community in supporting and encouraging Scratchers to keep coding. That said, we also understand your concerns about sharing publicly on Scratch. Keep in mind that you can always choose to use the offline version of Scratch instead, which removes the online community entirely from the equation. Thank you again for sharing your thoughts.

The benefits are that 1) It can be used on-line without an account, 2) the students can use it on a chromebook 3) the students can save their work directly to Google Drive.  They can then submit their work to me via Google Classroom or, if you are not using Google classroom, they could share the file with you.  I have not yet tested having to grade all of these but I think it might not be a problem if I download the off-line editor on my Mac.

Sorry if this is confusing! It looks like the account ""lindawollan"" was created six months ago - we had not released Teachers Account when you created this so it is a regular Scratch account, not a Teacher Account. Might you have created another account using a different username? (The username can be found in the emails that you received.) If not, that's okay.

There are a couple ways your students might migrate their projects from a regular account to a student account. The first way would be to download their projects from the regular account and then re-upload them into their newly created student account. Alternatively – and perhaps easier – they can make use of Scratch's remix feature and remix their projects from their regular account to the new student account.

I have the same problem as George - I want to move students from one class to another. I don't want to have to go through the tedious process of deleting students' accounts, then creating new accounts, with new usernames, for every student, just so I can re-organize the classes that they are all in. From now on, I plan to only create Scratch classes that will be named according to graduation year, so students will just stay in that same class as they move from one year level to the next. But that doesn't solve the problem of those students who are still enrolled in last year's class. I want to tidy things up, but don't want to have to spend lots of time deleting and re-creating student accounts, and confusing students who already have enough trouble remembering current usernames and passwords, without giving them a new one, or chasing up student to get them to delete their own accounts etc. etc. I've used a number of different online platforms for students over the years, and have never encountered one where account management is as cumbersome as it is on Scratch. I'm tempted to just go back to using the offline version of Scratch, which is what I did for years before Scratch teacher accounts became available.

Concepts like angles, times, basic aritmetic operations, polygons, others). We have already tested those guides in different classrooms. We also have two extracurricular workshops, running in the cities of Valladolid and Segovia, called CJP (Club de Jóvenes Programadores; Young Programmers Club), in which weekly (2 or 3 hours each week) over 50 children (ages 7-15) develop their own projects in Scratch.

They know how to use Scratch because last year they was working several introduction activities wich are designed in order to apply the Polya's problem solving technique. For this year, for example: If they are working with integer numbers and fractions, they make a construction in order to explain how to read a mix operation in english. If they are solving prblems about percentages they are going to make a consturction for calculating a discount of a product (like an online shop). If they are solving problems about the pythagoras theoreme they are going to make a construction to apply the theoreme.

I have experience doing these challenges with both non-CS teachers, so equivalent to your new CS teachers, as well as students. In both situations, they were able to pick which challenges they wanted to tackle, moving freely among them in any order. I taught an online course for teachers in my district about Creative Computing/Computational Thinking and none of the participants were straight-up CS teachers. We tried out the Debug It Challenges. I found some responses from their own experiences about how they worked through the challenges. Hopefully these might be helpful with your teachers. Learning from Peers/Collaboration ""At first I tried out adding some different buttons, a new green flag, a repeat, etc. I then looked at other students revisions and saw what they did, which inspired me to instead use a new motion button, and I liked that the best!"" Step Away ""I found that if I took a break, I was much more inclined to solve the problem quickly. I chose to debug a couple of challenges in Unit 4. I tried a few in the first two units but found the answers obvious and moved up a few levels."" Persistence ""I kept playing, tried different approaches and whallah!  I finally got it to work.  There is such a sense of gratification when you fix something!"" Experimentation ""When I first read that we had to debug projects I thought I wouldn't be able to do it! It turned out much easier than I anticipated and I felt successful. I thought the difficulty of the projects would increase a lot, but it seemed to stay a bit basic. I definitely appreciated that because I learned even more about the blocks, such as how to make a sprite flip. I also noticed myself thinking of the computational practices as I went through the exercises. How did I debug the projects? Mostly through experimentation. When I was done though, I did look at other projects (reuse and remix). For the last debugging activity, i did get the cat to saw meow with the speech bubble, but it was slow. I noticed another classmate used different blocks to get the cat to talk faster. We both completed the activity, but in a different way. Then I wondered, is one way the RIGHT way or does it matter if we both completed the project? I'm not sure it matters, but I think that we can learn a lot from each other."" Talking It Out (and I would add in acting out the task) ""When debugging, in all areas of life, I talk to myself.  A LOT.  With the debugging activities, I would read the instructions (sometimes incorrectly, as I discovered!), and then repeat the problem out loud in my own terms, and then go back and re-read one more time.  From there, I would go to the activity, open the script to examine it, and run it to see if what actually happened would align with what I thought was wrong.  Next, I’d take a deeper look at the buggy script, and start experimenting with changing the blocks, testing after each change was made.  It was similar to helping someone edit their video projects-- if there’s a gap in their media, or their image fades too quickly, or their audio is out of sync: you have to debug.  You have to keep trying things bit by bit, and then run it with each small change. And another vote for stepping away But sometimes, you have to step away and come back to it.  You can get so deeply hung up on fixing one part that you lose sight of the entire project, and that’s when it’s time to take a break.  I mentioned this to Ingrid-- that definition of insanity: “Insanity is when you keep doing the same thing and expecting different results..."" When you take some time to step back, look at the larger puzzle and all the other pieces in front of you, you can easily find the right fit.  This happened for me in a few of the debugging activities here… I took a break, went outside and shoveled snow, and came back in and suddenly the answer was right in front of me!""

After a few lessons a student suggested that it was better if they could work with colors. Then they could better clarify some things and would make it look nicer. My experience is that analoge journals gives them good focus, generates a lot of attention for their actions, creativity and diversity, is more inviting to work in the design journal at other times. The frontal reading and scroll back increases the importance of reflection. At the closing exhibition after 10 lessons for parents and family  the design journals were amongst other items (videos,  projects, activities and photos) a real attention grabber and much cause for conversation.

In my experience, they get distracted, don't listen because they're too busy trying out their own ideas, and you end up having to stop the class, fix and/or delete everything they're trying to add to the code, and then back up two or three steps because they didn't catch what you were talking about while they were making ten different colored sprites. LOL. ?I am strongly leaning toward more creative freedom for the class, but I am not really sure how to implement such a plan without resulting in pure chaos. An hour is probably not enough time to help 10 or 12 students with individual projects. Add to that the fact that we are not creating individual accounts for these kids (we are leaving that up to the parents if the kids want to pursue Scratch after the class) so they can't save any of their work. If they want to continue working on their projects this is going to be a problem! ?I will post my final lesson plan on here, whether I get any responses or not! Amy"5628	47432	Ideas for one hour introduction to Scratch for 8 to 12 year olds	2/10/17 18:05	"Hi Amy, when I write my activities, I've find that kids that age tended to zone out if we didn't get straight into 'doing things', at least for the first lesson. Something I've noticed about the activities in books, is that they seem more aimed at kids sitting at home, in a one-on-one setting, with more than an hour to read through. For your 1) rather than showing them a video, it could be just as easy to get them to actually make their own example. It keeps everyone engaged, and you can see those that get stuck straight away, and help them get their code working too. For this, you'd just want to have your screen up on a projector, and then have everyone follow along. It doesn't have to be really involved, just a simple loop. The one I've seen done well, is hooking in sound or visual input into movement of a sprite: look under 'Sensing' for 'loudness' or 'video' blocks. That will give them an fairly instant gratification. For those that it works, suggest a challenge e.g. changing sprites, or altering the code to see what happens, and while they're engaged with that, you can help others fix their code. At this point, there's not going to be a ton of debugging, but getting everyone's example working is really important so that they feel some achievement. With debugging though, just make sure you vocalise what you're doing, to keep kids engaged. The first time they jump ahead of you and say something like ""oh, I had the wrong value there"" is a huge step. Seeing as you don't have speakers and possibly not microphones and cameras available, what about starting with replicating a single scratch card for them to follow along with? They can group together to make a full game or project, and that would allow kids to grab one that they need for an idea. For instance, there's the scratch card that shows how to make a piece of clothing snap into the right position when dragged to a sprite. Something else that worked for us was to have a handout for kids to have a Scratch account before coming to the first 1 hour session. This meant that some had already had a play, but that they could also save their progress. In this day of tablets and mobile devices, kids relate this to when they can save game progress, and I've found it can be harder to get them motivated the next time, when they realise they have to re-create their project again. They'll also have something to 'take home' and show off, but also to build on later. One activity that has worked really well for my classes, is to show the kids how to do faux gravity, for a very very simple platform game. Once they have a character that they can move with keys and will sit on top of a 'level' they'll essentially be able to create their own game. We sometimes have done this, and then get the kids to go and play each other's games. With this, one thing to watch for, is that it's easy to have too ambitious a game idea, and then kids become frustrated when they realise how much code is needed. A good way to have a set scope, is just get the kids to draw a square on a piece of paper, put in some stick figures, and have a basic idea drawn out visually. That way, there's a defined scope for their first milestone i.e. reproducing their design in Scratch. Tell them to keep it real simple, as they can add extras once it is working. The important thing is that it works first. Then make sure you already have the extra features in your back pocket, so to speak. E.g. before the class, sit down and work out easy ways to do features such as score, change a one-player game to a two-player game (copy the first sprite and its code, then modify the code for the second player controls), or changing the game to make it multi level (change the background and player location when a goal sprite is collided with). To summarize: - do the activities yourself so that you know any gotchas beforehand (always helps to say, oh I ran into this one too) - try to get them making things straight away so they're not bored - verbalize any troubleshooting you do so they see the thought process and stay involved - keep the activity simple - allow them a way to save their work so they can show it off and add to it later - set simple challenges, and have something up your sleeve for the more advanced kids (there's always some) so you can help others troubleshoot This is my first reply so I'm trying to type fast enough that it wont time out :) Hope this helps.. justaboutfine"5629	47432	Ideas for one hour introduction to Scratch for 8 to 12 year olds	2/13/17 13:23	"justaboutfine, ?Thank you so much! I love the idea of having them set up accounts before the class! In fact, I already emailed our youth director and asked her to add this to the registration process. I felt really bad last time because they had to scrap thier whole game; I made one and posted it on Scratch for those who wanted to add on to it later, but a lot of them had customized their backdrops and sprites to make it more ""theirs"", and in that respect they would have had to redo some things. ?I like a lot of your ideas, actually! I wish that we had more classes so I can see what the kids come up with on thier own. I did request that they bring their own, simple ideas in the class description, so hopefully I'll have some that are ready to go with ideas so that I can help the ones that need it more. I wholly expect to have all different levels of experience. I will definately be using the scratch cards as you suggested. Having them start with a simple idea and then build from there sounds much more productive then dragging them all through a game they are not really interested in. ?I will post my final curriculum (for one hour - LOL) here, and also let everyone know how my (now second) attempt went! ?Amy C."5633	47494	"Changing students at the ""end"" of a class"	2/15/17 13:10	"Hi Martha.

Not the best solution, but it worked."5702	50920	Batch Reset All Classroom Student Passwords	6/26/17 20:21	"Hi there! The csv feature is only for new accounts; if you try to upload a csv with usernames that have already been created on the site, nothing will happen (it will just show an error on the screen). At this time, the only way to change the passwords is to do it manually. However, in the password change screen, you have two options: to change the password to something specific, or to simply prompt the student upon login to change it themselves - which may be the faster option, if you are doing many of these."5703	50920	Batch Reset All Classroom Student Passwords	6/27/17 7:35	"Thank you for the replies. I have about 150  to 200 accounts to reset, I'll start plugging away with resetting them. I think I will do the same and assign the same password as the same and anyone that wants to change it certainly may.  I have grades 3 through 8 with accounts with the hopes of getting grade 2 in as well."5732	51050	Rube Goldberg Scratch	10/30/17 21:51	"Our third graders used Lego WeDo motors and sensors to create Rube Goldberg machines combining physical elements (dominoes, blocks, marbles, ramps, etc.) with Scratch animations. For example, they programmed the distance sensor to react to a domino falling in front of it activating a Scratch animation  on the computer. When the animation ended it activated a motor to turn on which pushed a marble down a ramp."5710	51408	Bordeaux Scratch Conference Streaming This Week	7/21/17 9:14	Live streaming has not been working this week but videos are being captured and uploaded to Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/user/69icap/videos5711	51492	Need help with an Educational Presentation on Thursday	7/26/17 19:24	What is it that you are trying to put together? What type of examples are you looking for? Age group?  Etc. I have given teachers in my school several project ideas with framework to code however due to classroom time constraints sometimes they have a difficult time integrating as fully as they'd like.

Currently it is not possible to move students from Teacher to Teacher or class to class. We are still in the process of thinking through what this flow might look like and apologize for any inconvenience this causes you. In the meantime, we do have a couple suggestions that would allow your students to keep their work. Your idea of using studios is wonderful! This is something we've suggested in the past and I think that it would work well for the needs you are describing. If you do not want to use studios and/or each Teacher wants to have students in their own, unique classroom, another possible option would be to make use of the remix feature. Students can remix their work from one account to another. Alternatively, they can also always download their projects from one account and reupload them into another. (Even if a class has been ""closed"", shared projects can still be found remixed/downloaded.) I hope these suggestions help!

If you close a current class, the studio itself will still be visible on Scratch, but the students will no longer be able to log into their previous accounts. When students make new accounts for the new classroom, it is possible for them to then remix their old projects and save them onto their new class studio, it will just take some time to 'transfer' the files from the old studio into the new one. Here is the info from the teacher FAQ, if you haven't seen it: What happens when I ""end"" my class? When you end a class, your class profile page will be hidden and your students will no longer be able to log in (but their projects and the class studios will still be visible on the site). You may re-open the class at any time. I'd also recommend hopping onto the Teaching with Scratch Facebook group, an extension of the ScratchEd discussion boards, to gather insight from more educators about the topic.

In Unit 4, students are given some tools and tips for Game Design. I wonder if it would provide some scaffholding for your students to design their own games? Particularly, it emphasizes the value of personalization, so students can create games that are directly related to something they're excited about.

I believe this will teach you how to post the stickey notes! Here is the transcribed information from Scratch Wiki: Comments in the Scratch program are adjustable textboxes that can be attached to blocks, or left floating. The comment boxes can be adjusted both horizontally and vertically, dragged around the Scripts Area, and deleted. In a survey conducted by the Scratch Team, which tried to identify the top scripts used by Scratchers, the comment block (which was accidentally found by the survey engine due to technical reasons) ranked 10th, is 0.68% of all scripts on the website. To add a comment to a block, right-click it, and in the drop-down menu choose ""add comment"". This will add a yellow box in which you can type your comment. Comments can be added anywhere in the Scripts Area the same way. In 2.0, comments are created by right-clicking. If you right-click on a block, the comment will be connected by a (very) thin line to that block. If you right-click on the stage, the comment will not be connected to anything. You can edit or delete a comment by right-clicking on it. Mini comments are one line long and hold the amount of characters that will fit on one width of the comment. Change from Mini to Full by clicking the triangle at the top left of the comment. Full comments display all text entered into it, which can extend infinitely. The width (size) of comments can be altered by clicking (the parallel lines at) the bottom right-hand corner of the comment and dragging to the desired width (size). This can also be extended infinitely and is particularly useful if the mini comment is too narrow to display a sufficient amount of characters. I hope this is helpful!

The best solution I've found for this is to have students create a master game sprite where they drag all of their scripts, sprite costumes and backdrops into. Then this 1 sprite can be exported/imported to combine work of multiple students into 1 game. This doesn't work if each student is creating tons of content in their project, but works really well if parts of the game have been split between several students. To avoid confusion I would have them include their username (if not real name) in the master sprite name.

This is a great question. One thing you might recommend for students is that they get a new account on their own, and 'remix' the projects that they'd created previously so that they are able to save their projects before you delete them from the class. I'm sure there are many other ways to approach this...Have you shared this question in the Teaching with Scratch Facebook Group? We're slowly migrating discussions over to there, and I think you'll find a lot of great support from the educators in the group!

What types of unexpected results do you get? I wonder if it is a product of the actual approach, or whether it's something with the less updated version of Scratch? Also, have you shared this question in the Teaching with Scratch Facebook Group? We're slowly migrating discussions over to there, and I think you'll find a lot of great support from the educators in the group! Best, Alexa, on behalf of the ScratchEd Team"5869	58831	"Broadcast vs. ""when background changes""?"	10/31/18 10:13	"Thanks for the suggestion. I've signed up for the FB group. The unexpected results were that not everything that I wanted to happen actually happened. For instance -- go to level 2 = change background to level 2 background. Show some new sprites, speed up the old sprites, reset the timer, etc. Everything didn't work exactly as planned. But it always does with the broadcast. As I mentioned, though, I find the broadcast concept a tricky one for students to master. However, sometimes you want a whole bunch of changes to happen (say, when a certain score is reached, a character goes off the screen, etc.) and you DON'T want to change the background. At that point, you really have to use a broadcast. So I'm still pondering best approach. Thanks for the reply."5864	58903	Error message when trying to add followers to studio	10/25/18 15:45	"Hi Priya! I wonder if perhaps the invite has already been sent, and so it is reading as inviting a member more than once? Here's what I found on the wiki: ""To add a curator to a studio you curate, you must be a manager of the studio. First, go to the ""Curators"" tab and press the button that says ""Invite Curators."" From there, click on a user from the bar at the bottom of the page that contains all the users you are following, or type the username in the box below the button. If they have already been invited or they are already a curator of the studio, then it will give you an error message. The user you have selected will get a notification asking them if they would like to curate that studio, in which they can choose whether they want to curate the studio or not. You cannot invite someone twice."" Have you shared this question in the Teaching with Scratch Facebook Group?

Are you saying that now there is no way for them to become curators of the project because I can not invite someone twice? Thanks for the clarification.
